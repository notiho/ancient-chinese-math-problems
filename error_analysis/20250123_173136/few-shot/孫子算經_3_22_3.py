#ERR: misunderstood problem

The problem and the procedure provided are somewhat ambiguous and seem to involve a specific ancient Chinese mathematical technique for calculating the total number of items in a bundle based on its external circumference. However, the exact meaning of the procedure is unclear without additional context or clarification.

If you can provide more details or clarify the procedure, I can attempt to translate it into Python code.
