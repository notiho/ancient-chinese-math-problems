The problem states that we have a certain amount of \u7cf2\u7c73 (coarse rice) and want to convert it into \u7c9f (millet).

The amount of \u7cf2\u7c73 is given as 15\u65975\u53472\u5206\u5347. We convert this into a single fraction:\n   - 1\u6597 = 10\u5347, so 5\u5347 = 5/10\u6597.\n   - 1\u5347 = 10\u5206\u5347, so 2\u5206\u5347 = 2/(10*10)\u6597.\n   - Total = 15\u6597 + 5/10\u6597 + 2/(10*10)\u6597 = `Fraction(15) + Fraction(5, 10) + Fraction(2, 100)`.\n\n2.
