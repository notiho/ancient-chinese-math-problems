今有程耕，一人一日發七畝，一人一日耕三畝，一人一日耰種五畝。今令一人一日自發、耕、耰種之，問︰治田幾何？
術曰：置發、耕、耰畝數，令互乘人數，并以為法。畝數相乘為實。實如法得一畝。
荅曰： a畝 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves determining how much land one person can manage in a day if they perform all three tasks (plowing, tilling, and sowing) themselves. Here's the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
plowing_per_day = 7  # One person can plow 7 畝 per day
tilling_per_day = 3  # One person can till 3 畝 per day
sowing_per_day = 5   # One person can sow 5 畝 per day

# Calculate the total land managed in one day
a = Fraction(1, (1/plowing_per_day + 1/tilling_per_day + 1/sowing_per_day))

# The result
a  # This is the amount of land (in 畝) one person can manage in one day


"""


The variable `a` represents the solution, which is the amount of land (in 畝) one person can manage in one day.
