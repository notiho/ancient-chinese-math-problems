今有金箠，長五尺。斬本一尺，重四斤。斬末一尺，重二斤。問︰次一尺各重幾何？
術曰：令末重減本重，餘即差率也。又置本重，以四間乘之，為下第一衰。副置，以差率減之，每尺各自為衰。副置下第一衰以為法，以本重四斤遍乘列衰，各自為實。實如法得一斤。
荅曰：末一尺，重 a斤 。次一尺， 重 b斤 。次一尺， 重 c斤 。次一尺， 重 d斤 。次一尺， 重 e斤

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves a gold rod of 5 feet in length. The weight of the first foot (base) is 4 pounds, and the weight of the last foot (tip) is 2 pounds. We are tasked with calculating the weight of each of the intermediate feet.

The solution involves using the difference in weight between the base and the tip to determine the rate of change in weight per foot. Then, we calculate the weight of each intermediate foot based on this rate.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
base_weight = Fraction(4)  # Weight of the first foot (base) in pounds
tip_weight = Fraction(2)   # Weight of the last foot (tip) in pounds
length = 5                 # Total length of the rod in feet

# Calculate the rate of change in weight per foot
rate_of_change = (tip_weight - base_weight) / (length - 1)

# Calculate the weight of each foot
a = base_weight
b = a + rate_of_change
c = b + rate_of_change
d = c + rate_of_change
e = d + rate_of_change

# Results
a, b, c, d, e


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Base Weight and Tip Weight**: The weights of the first and last feet are given as 4 pounds and 2 pounds, respectively.
2. **Rate of Change**: The difference in weight between the base and the tip is divided by the number of intervals (length - 1) to find the rate of change in weight per foot.
3. **Intermediate Weights**: Starting from the base weight, we add the rate of change successively to calculate the weights of the intermediate feet.

### Output:
The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` represent the weights of the 5 feet of the rod:
- `a`: Weight of the first foot (base)
- `b`: Weight of the second foot
- `c`: Weight of the third foot
- `d`: Weight of the fourth foot
- `e`: Weight of the fifth foot (tip)

You can run the code to compute the exact values.
