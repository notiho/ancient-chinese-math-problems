今有粟七斗九升，欲為御米。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求御米，二十一之，五十而一。
荅曰：為御米 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of "御米" (refined rice) obtained from 7斗9升 of 粟 (unrefined grain). The problem states that for every 21 units of 粟, we get 1 unit of 御米. 

### Conversion:
1 斗 = 10 升, so 7斗9升 = 7 * 10 + 9 = 79 升.

### Formula:
御米 = 粟 × (1 / 21)

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
粟 = 79  # in 升

# Conversion ratio
conversion_ratio = Fraction(1, 21)

# Calculate 御米
a = 粟 * conversion_ratio  # in 升

# Convert back to 斗 (1 斗 = 10 升)
a = a / 10  # in 斗

# Result
a  # in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 御米 in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 1659/500, Actual: 79/210"""
