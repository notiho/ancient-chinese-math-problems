今有方物一束外周，一市有三十二枚。問：積幾何？
術曰：重置二位左位減八餘加右位，至盡虛加一，即得。
答曰： a枚 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical method into Python code. The problem describes a bundle of items arranged in a square shape, with 32 items on the outer perimeter. We are tasked to find the total number of items in the square (denoted as `a`).

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
outer_perimeter = 32  # items on the outer perimeter

# Step 1: Calculate the side length of the square
side_length = Fraction(outer_perimeter, 4)

# Step 2: Calculate the total number of items in the square
a = side_length ** 2  # total items in the square

# Result
a  # This is the total number of items


"""


The variable `a` will hold the total number of items in the square.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 81, Actual: 64"""
