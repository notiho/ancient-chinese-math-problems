今有粟四斗五升，欲為鑿米。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求鑿米，十二之，二十五而一。
荅曰：為鑿米 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much "鑿米" (polished rice) can be obtained from 4斗5升 of 粟 (unpolished rice). The method provided states that for every 12 units of 粟, 1 unit of 鑿米 is obtained. 

### Steps:
1. Convert 4斗5升 into a single unit (斗). Since 1斗 = 10升, 4斗5升 = \( 4 + \frac{5}{10} = 4.5 \)斗.
2. Use the ratio \( \frac{1}{12} \) to calculate the amount of 鑿米.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
粟 = Fraction(4, 1) + Fraction(5, 10)  # 4斗5升 = 4.5斗
ratio = Fraction(1, 12)  # For every 12 units of 粟, 1 unit of 鑿米

# Calculation
a = 粟 * ratio  # Amount of 鑿米 in 斗

# Result
a  # 鑿米 in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 鑿米 in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 54/25, Actual: 3/8"""
