"""
今有粟四斗五升，欲為鑿米。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求鑿米，十二之，二十五而一。
荅曰：為鑿米 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem states that we have 4斗5升 of 粟 (grain), and we want to convert it into 鑿米 (polished rice). The conversion rule is given as "12之, 25而1," which means 12 units of 粟 produce 1 unit of 鑿米. 

First, we need to convert 4斗5升 into a single unit (斗). Since 1斗 = 10升, 4斗5升 = 4 + 5/10 = 4.5斗. Then, we apply the conversion rule.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
粟 = Fraction(4, 1) + Fraction(5, 10)  # 4斗5升 = 4.5斗

# Conversion rule: 12 units of 粟 produce 1 unit of 鑿米
a = 粟 / 12  # Divide 粟 by 12 to get 鑿米

# Result
a  # 鑿米 in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will store the amount of 鑿米 in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 54/25, Actual: 3/8"""
