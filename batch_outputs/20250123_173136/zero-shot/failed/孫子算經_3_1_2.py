今有丁一千五百萬，出兵四十萬。問：幾丁科一兵？
術曰：置丁一千五百萬為實，以兵四十萬為法，實如法，即得。
答曰： a 丁 b分 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many 丁 (a) are required for one 兵. The problem states that there are 1,500,000 丁 and 400,000 兵. This is a simple division problem.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_ding = 15000000  # Total 丁
total_bing = 400000    # Total 兵

# Calculate 丁 per 兵
a = Fraction(total_ding, total_bing)

# Output the result
a_ding = a  # 丁 per 兵


"""


The result `a_ding` will represent the number of 丁 per 兵 in the form of a fraction.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 37, Actual: 75/2
Missing variable in output: 'b'"""
