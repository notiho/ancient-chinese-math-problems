今有積四千五百尺。問︰為立圓徑幾何？
開立圓術曰：置積尺數，以十六乘之，九而一，所得開立方除之，即丸徑。
荅曰： a尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical method into Python code. The problem involves finding the diameter (`a`) of a sphere given its volume (`積`) in cubic feet. The formula provided in the problem can be interpreted as follows:

1. Multiply the volume by 16.
2. Divide the result by 9.
3. Take the cube root of the result.
4. The result is the diameter of the sphere.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
volume = 4500  # in cubic feet

# Step 1: Multiply the volume by 16
step1 = volume * 16

# Step 2: Divide the result by 9
step2 = Fraction(step1, 9)

# Step 3: Take the cube root of the result
# Cube root can be represented as raising to the power of 1/3
a = step2 ** Fraction(1, 3)

# The diameter of the sphere is stored in variable 'a'


"""


The variable `a` now contains the diameter of the sphere in feet.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 20, Actual: 19.999999999999996"""
