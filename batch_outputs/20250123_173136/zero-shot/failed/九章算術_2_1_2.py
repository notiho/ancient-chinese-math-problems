"""
今有粟二斗一升，欲為粺米。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求粺米，二十七之，五十而一。
荅曰：為粺米 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much 粺米 (refined rice) can be obtained from 粟 (unrefined rice). The problem states that for every 27 units of 粟, we get 1 unit of 粺米. The given amount of 粟 is 2斗1升, and we need to convert this into 粺米.

First, note that 1斗 = 10升. Therefore, 2斗1升 = 2 * 10 + 1 = 21升.

Now, we apply the ratio: for every 27 units of 粟, we get 1 unit of 粺米. This means we divide the total amount of 粟 by 27 to find the amount of 粺米.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
粟_in_升 = 2 * 10 + 1  # 2斗1升 = 21升

# Conversion ratio
粟_to_粺米_ratio = Fraction(1, 27)

# Calculate 粺米
a = 粟_in_升 * 粟_to_粺米_ratio  # 粺米 in 斗

# Result
a  # 粺米 in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 粺米 in 斗 as a `Fraction`.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 567/500, Actual: 7/9"""
