今有立木，繫索其末，委地三尺。引索卻行，去本八尺而索盡。問︰索長幾何？
術曰：以去本自乘，令如委數而一，所得，加委地數而半之，即索長
荅曰： a丈 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves a standing tree (立木), a rope tied to its top, and the rope touching the ground three feet away from the base of the tree. When the rope is pulled taut, the person pulling it walks 8 feet away from the base of the tree. We are tasked with finding the length of the rope.

The solution method provided in the problem can be translated into Python as follows:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
base_distance = Fraction(8)  # Distance from the base of the tree in feet
ground_distance = Fraction(3)  # Distance from the base of the tree to where the rope touches the ground in feet

# Calculation
a = (base_distance ** 2 + ground_distance ** 2) ** Fraction(1, 2)  # Length of the rope in feet

# The result
a  # Length of the rope in feet


"""


The variable `a` will contain the length of the rope in feet.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 73/60, Actual: 8.54400374531753"""
