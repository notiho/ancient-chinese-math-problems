今有鑿米三斗、少半升，欲為粟。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以鑿米求粟，二十五之，十二而一。
荅曰：為粟 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of 粟 (a) obtained from 鑿米 (3斗 and 少半升). The conversion rule is given: for every 25 units of 鑿米, 12 units of 粟 are obtained. 

### Steps:
1. Convert the 鑿米 into a single unit (斗).
2. Use the conversion ratio (25 鑿米 → 12 粟) to calculate the amount of 粟.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
鑿米 = Fraction(3) + Fraction(1, 2) / 10  # 3斗 and 少半升 (1/2升 = 1/20斗)

# Conversion ratio: 25 鑿米 → 12 粟
conversion_ratio = Fraction(12, 25)

# Calculate 粟 (a)
a = 鑿米 * conversion_ratio

# Result
a  # 粟 in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 粟 in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 455/72, Actual: 183/125"""
