今有取傭負鹽二斛，行一百里，與錢四十。今負鹽一斛七斗三升、少半升，行八十里。問︰與錢幾何？
術曰：置鹽二斛升數，以一百里乘之為法。以四十錢乘今負鹽升數，又以八十里乘之，為實。實如法得一錢。
荅曰： a錢 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the payment for carrying a certain amount of salt over a certain distance based on a given rate.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
salt_1 = 2  # in hu (斛)
distance_1 = 100  # in li (里)
payment_1 = 40  # in qian (錢)

salt_2 = Fraction(1) + Fraction(7, 10) + Fraction(3, 100) - Fraction(1, 200)  # 1斛7斗3升少半升
distance_2 = 80  # in li (里)

# Calculation
# Convert salt_1 to sheng (升): 1 hu = 10 dou, 1 dou = 10 sheng
salt_1_sheng = salt_1 * 10 * 10  # 2斛 = 200升

# Convert salt_2 to sheng (升): already in fractional form
salt_2_sheng = salt_2 * 10 * 10  # Convert to 升

# Formula: payment = (payment_1 * salt_2_sheng * distance_2) / (salt_1_sheng * distance_1)
a = (payment_1 * salt_2_sheng * distance_2) / (salt_1_sheng * distance_1)

# Output the result
a  # in qian (錢)


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Salt Conversion**: The problem uses the traditional Chinese units of measurement. We convert the salt quantities into "sheng" (升) for consistency.
   - 1 hu (斛) = 10 dou (斗), and 1 dou = 10 sheng (升).
   - Therefore, 1 hu = 100 sheng.

2. **Distance and Payment**: The given distances and payments are used directly in the formula.

3. **Formula**: The payment is calculated proportionally based on the given rate:
   \[
   \text{payment} = \frac{\text{payment}_1 \times \text{salt}_2 \times \text{distance}_2}{\text{salt}_1 \times \text{distance}_1}
   \]

4. **Result**: The result is stored in the variable `a`, representing the payment in qian (錢).

### Final Answer:
The variable `a` will contain the payment in qian (錢).

Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 416/15, Actual: 138/5"""
