今有黃金九枚，白銀一十一枚，稱之重適等。交易其一，金輕十三兩。問︰金、銀一枚各重幾何？
術曰：假令黃金三斤，白銀二斤、一十一分斤之五，不足四十九，於右行。令之黃金二斤，白銀一斤、一十一分斤之七，多一十五於左行。以分母各乘其行內之數，以盈不足維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈不足為法。實如法，得黃金重。分母乘法以除，得銀重。約之得分也。
荅曰：金重 a斤 ，銀重 b斤 。

To solve the problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical method into Python code. The problem involves finding the weights of one piece of gold (`a`) and one piece of silver (`b`) such that the total weight of 9 pieces of gold equals the total weight of 11 pieces of silver. Additionally, when one piece of gold is exchanged for one piece of silver, the weight difference is 13 taels.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Let the weight of one piece of gold be `a` (in jin) and one piece of silver be `b` (in jin).
# From the problem:
# 1. 9a = 11b  (total weight of 9 gold pieces equals total weight of 11 silver pieces)
# 2. a - b = Fraction(13, 16) (weight difference when one gold is exchanged for one silver)

# Solve the equations:
# From equation 1: a = (11/9) * b
# Substitute into equation 2: (11/9) * b - b = 13/16
# Simplify: (11b - 9b) / 9 = 13/16
# 2b / 9 = 13/16
# b = (13/16) * (9/2)

b = Fraction(13, 16) * Fraction(9, 2)

# Substitute b into a = (11/9) * b
a = Fraction(11, 9) * b

# Results
a  # Weight of one piece of gold in jin
b  # Weight of one piece of silver in jin


"""


### Explanation:
1. The first equation comes from the condition that the total weight of 9 gold pieces equals the total weight of 11 silver pieces: \( 9a = 11b \).
2. The second equation comes from the condition that the weight difference between one piece of gold and one piece of silver is 13 taels: \( a - b = \frac{13}{16} \).
3. By substituting \( a = \frac{11}{9}b \) into the second equation, we solve for \( b \) (weight of one piece of silver).
4. Once \( b \) is determined, we substitute it back into \( a = \frac{11}{9}b \) to find \( a \) (weight of one piece of gold).

### Final Results:
- \( a \) (weight of one piece of gold in jin)
- \( b \) (weight of one piece of silver in jin)
