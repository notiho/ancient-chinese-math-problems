今有出錢二千三百七十，買布九匹二丈七尺。欲匹率之，問︰匹幾何？
經術術曰：以所求率乘錢數為實，以所買率為法，實如法得一。
荅曰：一匹， a錢
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of one匹 (one bolt of cloth). The total cost is 2370錢, and the total amount of cloth purchased is 9匹 and 2丈7尺. First, we need to convert the total cloth into a consistent unit (e.g., 尺), then calculate the cost per匹.

Assume:
- 1丈 = 10尺.

### Step-by-step solution:
1. Convert the total cloth purchased into 尺:
   \( 9匹 \times 10丈 \times 10尺 + 2丈 \times 10尺 + 7尺 \).

2. Calculate the cost per匹:
   Divide the total cost (2370錢) by the total number of匹 (9匹).

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total cost in 錢
total_cost = 2370

# Total cloth purchased in 尺
total_cloth_in_匹 = 9  # 9匹
total_cloth_in_丈 = 2  # 2丈
total_cloth_in_尺 = 7  # 7尺

# Convert all cloth to 尺
total_cloth_in_尺 += total_cloth_in_丈 * 10  # Convert 丈 to 尺
total_cloth_in_尺 += total_cloth_in_匹 * 10 * 10  # Convert 匹 to 尺

# Cost per 匹
a = Fraction(total_cost, 9)  # Divide total cost by number of 匹

# Output the result
a  # Cost per 匹 in 錢


"""


The variable `a` will hold the cost of one匹 in 錢.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 31600/129, Actual: 790/3"""
