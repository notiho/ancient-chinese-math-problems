又有環田，中周六十二步、四分步之三，外周一百一十三步、二分步之一，徑十二步、三分步之二。問：為田幾何？
術曰：并中外周而半之，以徑乘之為積步。
荅曰： a畝 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the circular field using the given dimensions. The formula provided in the problem is to take the average of the inner and outer circumferences, multiply it by the diameter, and divide by 2 to get the area in steps. Then, we convert the area into "畝" (a traditional Chinese unit of area).

Here is the Python code to compute the value of `a`:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
inner_circumference = Fraction(62, 1) + Fraction(3, 4)  # 中周六十二步、四分步之三
outer_circumference = Fraction(113, 1) + Fraction(1, 2)  # 外周一百一十三步、二分步之一
diameter = Fraction(12, 1) + Fraction(2, 3)  # 徑十二步、三分步之二

# Compute the average circumference
average_circumference = (inner_circumference + outer_circumference) / 2

# Compute the area in steps
area_in_steps = average_circumference * diameter / 2

# Convert steps to 畝 (1 畝 = 240 steps²)
a = area_in_steps / 240

# The result is stored in variable 'a'


"""


The variable `a` now contains the area of the field in 畝.

"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 893/192, Actual: 893/384"""
