今有粟，二千三百七十四斛，斛加三升。問：共粟幾何？
術曰：置粟二千三百七十四斛，以一斛三升乘之，即得。
答曰： a斛 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to compute the total amount of grain when each "斛" (unit of grain) is increased by 3 "升" (another unit of grain). Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
original_grain = 2374  # in 斛
increase_per_hu = Fraction(3, 10)  # 3 升 is 3/10 of a 斛

# Calculation
a = original_grain * (1 + increase_per_hu)  # Total grain in 斛


"""


The variable `a` now contains the total amount of grain in 斛.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 122261/50, Actual: 15431/5"""
