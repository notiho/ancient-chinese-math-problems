"""
今有粟四斗五升，欲為鑿米。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求鑿米，十二之，二十五而一。
荅曰：為鑿米 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much "鑿米" (polished rice) can be obtained from 4斗5升 of "粟" (unpolished rice). The method provided states that for every 12 units of unpolished rice, 1 unit of polished rice is obtained. 

Let's translate this into Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
粟 = 4 + Fraction(5, 10)  # 4斗5升, where 1斗 = 10升

# Conversion ratio
conversion_ratio = Fraction(1, 12)  # 1 unit of polished rice for every 12 units of unpolished rice

# Calculate the amount of polished rice
a = 粟 * conversion_ratio

# Output the result
a  # a斗


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of polished rice in terms of "斗".
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 54/25, Actual: 3/8"""
