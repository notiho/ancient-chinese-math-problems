今有蒲生一日，長三尺。莞生一日，長一尺。蒲生日自半。莞生日自倍。問︰幾何日而長等？
術曰：假令二日，不足一尺五寸。令之三日，有餘一尺七寸半。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰： a日 。各長 b尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical problem into Python code. The problem involves determining the number of days (`a`) it takes for two plants, "蒲" and "莞", to grow to the same length, given their growth rates and initial conditions. Additionally, we will compute their respective lengths (`b`) at that time.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Growth rates and initial conditions
growth_rate_pu = Fraction(3, 1)  # 蒲 grows 3尺 per day
growth_rate_guan = Fraction(1, 1)  # 莞 grows 1尺 per day
initial_length_pu = Fraction(3, 2)  # 蒲 starts at half its daily growth (3尺 / 2)
initial_length_guan = Fraction(2, 1)  # 莞 starts at double its daily growth (1尺 * 2)

# Let the number of days be 'a'
# Length of 蒲 after 'a' days: initial_length_pu + a * growth_rate_pu
# Length of 莞 after 'a' days: initial_length_guan + a * growth_rate_guan
# Set the lengths equal to find 'a':
# initial_length_pu + a * growth_rate_pu = initial_length_guan + a * growth_rate_guan

# Solve for 'a':
a = (initial_length_guan - initial_length_pu) / (growth_rate_pu - growth_rate_guan)

# Compute the length 'b' when the lengths are equal:
b = initial_length_pu + a * growth_rate_pu

# Results
a  # Number of days
b  # Length of each plant at that time


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Growth Rates and Initial Conditions**:
   - 蒲 grows 3尺 per day and starts at half its daily growth (3尺 / 2).
   - 莞 grows 1尺 per day and starts at double its daily growth (1尺 * 2).

2. **Equation Setup**:
   - The length of 蒲 after `a` days is `initial_length_pu + a * growth_rate_pu`.
   - The length of 莞 after `a` days is `initial_length_guan + a * growth_rate_guan`.
   - Set these lengths equal to solve for `a`.

3. **Solution**:
   - Solve for `a` using the formula `(initial_length_guan - initial_length_pu) / (growth_rate_pu - growth_rate_guan)`.
   - Compute the length `b` by substituting `a` into the length equation for either plant.

### Results:
- `a` is the number of days it takes for the plants to have equal lengths.
- `b` is the length of each plant at that time.
