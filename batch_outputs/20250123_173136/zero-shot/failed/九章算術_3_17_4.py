今有田一畝，收粟六升、太半升。今有田一頃二十六畝一百五十九步，問︰收粟幾何？
術曰：以畝二百四十步為法，以六升、太半升乘今有田積步為實，實如法得粟數。
荅曰： a斛 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of grain harvested from a field of a given size. The problem states that 1 畝 yields 6 升 and 太半升 (which is 1/2 升). The total field size is given as 1 頃, 26 畝, and 159 步. We are asked to find the total harvest in 斛.

### Key Information:
1. 1 畝 = 240 步.
2. 1 斛 = 10 升.
3. Total field size = 1 頃 + 26 畝 + 159 步.
   - 1 頃 = 100 畝 = 100 × 240 步 = 24000 步.
   - 26 畝 = 26 × 240 步 = 6240 步.
   - 159 步 = 159 步.
   - Total field size in 步 = 24000 + 6240 + 159 步.
4. Yield per 畝 = 6 升 + 太半升 = 6 + 1/2 升 = 13/2 升.
   - Yield per 步 = (13/2 升) ÷ 240 步 = 13/(2 × 240) 升 = 13/480 升.

### Calculation:
We multiply the total field size in 步 by the yield per 步 to get the total yield in 升, then convert 升 to 斛.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Constants
步_per_畝 = 240
升_per_斛 = 10

# Field size
頃 = 1
畝 = 26
步 = 159

# Convert field size to 步
total_步 = 頃 * 100 * 步_per_畝 + 畝 * 步_per_畝 + 步

# Yield per 步
yield_per_步 = Fraction(13, 480)  # 13/480 升 per 步

# Total yield in 升
total_升 = total_步 * yield_per_步

# Convert 升 to 斛
a = total_升 / 升_per_斛

# Result
a  # Total yield in 斛


"""


### Explanation:
1. We calculate the total field size in 步 by converting 頃 and 畝 into 步 and adding the remaining 步.
2. We calculate the yield per 步 by dividing the yield per 畝 (13/2 升) by 240 步.
3. We multiply the total 步 by the yield per 步 to get the total yield in 升.
4. Finally, we convert 升 to 斛 by dividing by 10.

The variable `a` contains the total yield in 斛.
