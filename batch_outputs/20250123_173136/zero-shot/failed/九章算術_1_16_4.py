今有七人，分八錢三分錢之一。問：人得幾何？
經分術曰：以人數為法，錢數為實，實如法而一。有分者通之；重有分者同而通之。
荅曰：人得 a錢 。
"""

"""
To solve the problem, we need to divide the total amount of money (8 錢 and 3/10 錢) equally among 7 people. Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total money in 錢
total_money = Fraction(8) + Fraction(3, 10)

# Number of people
people = 7

# Money each person gets
a = total_money / people

# Result
a  # This is the amount of money each person gets in 錢


"""


The variable `a` will contain the solution, which is the amount of money each person gets in 錢.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 25/21, Actual: 83/70"""
