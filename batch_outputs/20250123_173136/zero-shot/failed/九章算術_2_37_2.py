今有出錢五百七十六，買竹七十八箇。欲其大小率之，問︰各幾何？
其率術曰：各置所買石、鈞、斤、兩以為法，以所率乘錢數為實，實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法賤實貴。
荅曰：其 a箇 ，箇 b錢 。其 c箇 ，箇 d錢 。

To solve this problem, we need to distribute the total money (576 units) among 78 bamboo items such that there are two types of bamboo: one type costs `a` money per item, and the other type costs `b` money per item. The total number of bamboo items is 78, and the total money spent is 576 units.

The problem doesn't specify the exact ratio or number of each type of bamboo, so we assume the simplest case where there are equal numbers of each type (39 of each type). Let's compute the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` accordingly.


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total money and total bamboo items
total_money = 576
total_items = 78

# Assume equal distribution of bamboo items
c = total_items // 2  # Number of bamboo items of one type
d = total_items - c   # Number of bamboo items of the other type

# Compute the cost per bamboo item for each type
a = Fraction(total_money, total_items)  # Cost per item for one type
b = a  # Since the distribution is equal, both types have the same cost

# Output the results
a, b, c, d

This code calculates the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` using the given constraints. If the problem specifies a different distribution or ratio, the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.
