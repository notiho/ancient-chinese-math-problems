今有醇酒一斗，直錢五十；行酒一斗，直錢一十。今將錢三十，得酒二斗。問︰醇、行酒各得幾何？
術曰：假令醇酒五升，行酒一斗五升，有餘一十。令之醇酒二升，行酒一斗八升，不足二。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰：醇酒 a升 ，行酒 b斗 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the amounts of pure wine (`a`, in liters) and diluted wine (`b`, in liters) that can be purchased with 30 units of money, given their respective prices and the total volume constraint.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Prices and constraints
price_pure_wine = 50  # Price of 1斗 of pure wine in money units
price_diluted_wine = 10  # Price of 1斗 of diluted wine in money units
total_money = 30  # Total money available
total_volume = 2  # Total volume of wine in 斗

# Let a = volume of pure wine in 斗
# Let b = volume of diluted wine in 斗
# We have the following system of equations:
# 50a + 10b = 30  (money constraint)
# a + b = 2       (volume constraint)

# Solve the system of equations
# From the second equation: b = 2 - a
# Substitute into the first equation:
# 50a + 10(2 - a) = 30
# 50a + 20 - 10a = 30
# 40a = 10
# a = 10 / 40
a = Fraction(10, 40)  # Simplify the fraction
a = a.limit_denominator()  # Ensure it's in the simplest form

# Calculate b using b = 2 - a
b = Fraction(2) - a

# Output the results
a  # Volume of pure wine in 斗
b  # Volume of diluted wine in 斗


"""


### Solution:
- `a = 1/4` (斗 of pure wine)
- `b = 7/4` (斗 of diluted wine)
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 5/2, Actual: 1/4"""
