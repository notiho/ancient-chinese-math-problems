今有出錢一萬三千六百七十，買絲一石二鈞一十七斤。欲石率之，問︰石幾何？
經術術曰：以所求率乘錢數為實，以所買率為法，實如法得一。
荅曰：一石， a錢
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost per "石" (a unit of weight) based on the given total cost and total weight. Here's the Python code that computes the value of "a" (the cost per "石"):


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_cost = 13670  # in 錢
total_weight = 1 + Fraction(2, 4) + Fraction(17, 100)  # 1 石 2 鈞 17 斤 converted to 石

# Calculation
a = total_cost / total_weight  # cost per 石 in 錢

# Result
a


"""


This code calculates the value of "a" (the cost per 石 in 錢). The result will be stored in the variable `a`.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 1640400/197, Actual: 1367000/167"""
