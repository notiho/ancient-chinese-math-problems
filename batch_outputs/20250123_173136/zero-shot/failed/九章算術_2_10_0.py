今有粟三斗少半升，欲為菽。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求菽、答、麻、麥，皆九之，十而一。
荅曰：為菽 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of 菽 (a斗) that can be obtained from 粟 (3斗少半升). The rule provided states that to convert 粟 to 菽, we multiply by 9 and then divide by 10.

### Step-by-step solution:
1. Convert the given 粟 (3斗少半升) into a single unit. Since 1斗 = 10升, "3斗少半升" means \(3斗 - 0.5升 = 30升 - 0.5升 = 29.5升\).
2. Use the conversion rule: Multiply the amount of 粟 by 9 and divide by 10 to get 菽.

Here is the Python code to compute the answer:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given 粟 in 升
粟 = Fraction(29.5)  # 3斗少半升 = 29.5升

# Conversion rule: Multiply by 9 and divide by 10
a = 粟 * Fraction(9, 10)

# The result is in 斗
a  # This is the amount of 菽 in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will contain the result in terms of 斗.

"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 273/100, Actual: 531/20"""
