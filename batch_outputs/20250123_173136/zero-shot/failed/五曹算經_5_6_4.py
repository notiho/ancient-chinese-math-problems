今有貴絲一两直錢五十六文，賤絲一两直錢四十二文，有錢一百三十一貫八百一十文。問：各得㡬何？
術曰：列錢一百三十一貫八百一十文為實，并絲貴賤價得九十八文為法，以法除實得絲一千三百四十五两以十六两除之得八十四斤餘一两次置之以三十斤除之即得。
答曰：各 a鈞 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to compute the amount of silk (in units of "斤" or "鈞") that can be purchased with the given amount of money, considering the prices of expensive silk and cheap silk.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
expensive_silk_price_per_liang = 56  # 貴絲一两直錢五十六文
cheap_silk_price_per_liang = 42     # 賤絲一两直錢四十二文
total_money_in_wen = 131 * 1000 + 810  # 一百三十一貫八百一十文 (1貫 = 1000文)

# Calculate the combined price per liang of silk
combined_price_per_liang = expensive_silk_price_per_liang + cheap_silk_price_per_liang  # 丝贵贱价得九十八文

# Calculate the total amount of silk in liang
total_silk_in_liang = Fraction(total_money_in_wen, combined_price_per_liang)  # 以法除实得丝一千三百四十五两

# Convert liang to jin (1斤 = 16两)
total_silk_in_jin = total_silk_in_liang // 16  # 得八十四斤
remaining_liang = total_silk_in_liang % 16     # 余一两

# Convert jin to "鈞" (1鈞 = 30斤)
a = total_silk_in_jin // 30  # 鈞
remaining_jin = total_silk_in_jin % 30  # Remaining jin

# Output the results
a  # Each "鈞" of silk


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Prices and Total Money**: The prices of expensive and cheap silk are given in 文 per 两. The total money is converted into 文.
2. **Combined Price**: The combined price per 两 is the sum of the prices of expensive and cheap silk.
3. **Total Silk in 两**: Divide the total money by the combined price to get the total amount of silk in 两.
4. **Convert to 斤**: Since 1斤 = 16两, divide the total 两 by 16 to get the amount in 斤 and the remainder in 两.
5. **Convert to 鈞**: Since 1鈞 = 30斤, divide the total 斤 by 30 to get the amount in 鈞 and the remainder in 斤.

The variable `a` represents the amount of silk in 鈞.
