今有漆三得油四，油四和漆五。今有漆三斗，欲令分以易油，還自和餘漆。問︰出漆、得油、和漆各幾何？
術曰：假令出漆九升，不足六升。令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰：出漆 a斗 ，得油 b斗 ，和漆 c斗 ， d升 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves determining the quantities of lacquer (漆) and oil (油) exchanged and the remaining lacquer after the exchange. Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
rate_lacquer_to_oil = Fraction(3, 4)  # 3 units of lacquer get 4 units of oil
rate_oil_to_lacquer = Fraction(4, 5)  # 4 units of oil get 5 units of lacquer

# Initial lacquer quantity
initial_lacquer = Fraction(3, 1)  # 3斗 of lacquer

# Assume the lacquer exchanged is 1斗2升 = 1斗 + 2升 = 1 + 2/10 = 1.2斗
exchanged_lacquer = Fraction(12, 10)  # 1.2斗 = 12/10斗

# Calculate the oil received for the exchanged lacquer
received_oil = exchanged_lacquer * rate_lacquer_to_oil

# Calculate the remaining lacquer after the exchange
remaining_lacquer = initial_lacquer - exchanged_lacquer

# Convert remaining lacquer into 斗 and 升
remaining_lacquer_dou = int(remaining_lacquer)  # Whole number part in 斗
remaining_lacquer_sheng = (remaining_lacquer - remaining_lacquer_dou) * 10  # Fractional part in 升

# Assign the results to variables
a = exchanged_lacquer  # 出漆 a斗
b = received_oil  # 得油 b斗
c = remaining_lacquer_dou  # 和漆 c斗
d = remaining_lacquer_sheng  # 和漆 d升

# Results
a, b, c, d


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Rates of Exchange**: The rates of exchange between lacquer and oil are given as fractions.
2. **Initial Lacquer**: The initial amount of lacquer is 3斗.
3. **Exchanged Lacquer**: The problem assumes 1斗2升 of lacquer is exchanged, which is converted into a fraction (1.2斗 = 12/10斗).
4. **Oil Received**: The amount of oil received is calculated using the rate of exchange.
5. **Remaining Lacquer**: The remaining lacquer is calculated by subtracting the exchanged lacquer from the initial lacquer.
6. **斗 and 升 Conversion**: The remaining lacquer is split into whole 斗 and fractional 升 (1斗 = 10升).
7. **Results**: The results are stored in variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

### Results:
- `a`: The amount of lacquer exchanged (in 斗).
- `b`: The amount of oil received (in 斗).
- `c`: The whole number part of the remaining lacquer (in 斗).
- `d`: The fractional part of the remaining lacquer (in 升).
