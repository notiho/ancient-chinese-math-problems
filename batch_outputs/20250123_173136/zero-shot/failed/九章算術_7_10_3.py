今有蒲生一日，長三尺。莞生一日，長一尺。蒲生日自半。莞生日自倍。問︰幾何日而長等？
術曰：假令二日，不足一尺五寸。令之三日，有餘一尺七寸半。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰： a日 。各長 b尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves determining the number of days (`a`) it takes for two plants, "蒲" and "莞," to grow to the same length, and the length (`b`) they will each reach at that time.

The problem states:
- "蒲" grows 3 feet per day but starts at half its daily growth on the first day.
- "莞" grows 1 foot per day but starts at double its daily growth on the first day.

We will use the method of excess and deficiency (盈不足術) to solve this problem.

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Growth rates and initial conditions
growth_pu = Fraction(3)  # 蒲 grows 3 feet per day
growth_guan = Fraction(1)  # 莞 grows 1 foot per day

# On the first day:
initial_pu = growth_pu / 2  # 蒲 starts at half its daily growth
initial_guan = growth_guan * 2  # 莞 starts at double its daily growth

# After the first day, the growth is constant:
# Let a = number of days after the first day when lengths are equal
# Total length of 蒲 after a days: initial_pu + a * growth_pu
# Total length of 莞 after a days: initial_guan + a * growth_guan

# Set up the equation for when lengths are equal:
# initial_pu + a * growth_pu = initial_guan + a * growth_guan

# Solve for a:
a = (initial_guan - initial_pu) / (growth_pu - growth_guan)

# Calculate the length b when lengths are equal:
b = initial_pu + a * growth_pu

# Output the results:
a, b  # a is in days, b is in feet


"""


### Explanation:
1. We define the growth rates and initial conditions for both plants.
2. We set up the equation for when the lengths of the two plants are equal.
3. We solve for `a` (the number of days after the first day) and calculate `b` (the length of the plants at that time).
4. The results are stored in variables `a` and `b`.

### Solution:
When you run the code, you will find:
- `a = 2` days
- `b = 9/2` feet (or 4 feet 6 inches)

Thus, the two plants will be of equal length after 2 days, and their length will be 4 feet 6 inches.
