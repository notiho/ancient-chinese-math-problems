今有漆三得油四，油四和漆五。今有漆三斗，欲令分以易油，還自和餘漆。問︰出漆、得油、和漆各幾何？
術曰：假令出漆九升，不足六升。令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰：出漆 a斗 ，得油 b斗 ，和漆 c斗 ， d升 。

To solve the problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` using the described method. Here's the Python implementation:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
rate_oil_per_3_dou_paint = Fraction(4, 3)  # 3斗漆得4斗油
rate_paint_per_4_dou_oil = Fraction(5, 4)  # 4斗油和5斗漆

# Step 1: Assume the output of paint is 1斗2升 (1斗 = 10升, so 1斗2升 = 12升)
output_paint = Fraction(12, 10)  # 1斗2升 = 12升 = 12/10斗

# Step 2: Calculate the amount of oil obtained
obtained_oil = output_paint * rate_oil_per_3_dou_paint  # 得油 = 出漆 × (4/3)

# Step 3: Calculate the remaining paint after mixing
remaining_paint = Fraction(3) - output_paint  # 初始3斗漆 - 出漆
mixed_paint = remaining_paint + (obtained_oil * rate_paint_per_4_dou_oil)  # 和漆 = 剩餘漆 + (得油 × 5/4)

# Step 4: Convert mixed_paint into dou and sheng
mixed_paint_dou = int(mixed_paint)  # Whole dou
mixed_paint_sheng = (mixed_paint - mixed_paint_dou) * 10  # Convert fractional part to sheng

# Assign results to variables
a = output_paint  # 出漆
b = obtained_oil  # 得油
c = mixed_paint_dou  # 和漆 (斗 part)
d = mixed_paint_sheng  # 和漆 (升 part)

# Results
a, b, c, d

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Rate Conversion**: The problem gives the rates of exchange between paint and oil. These are converted into fractions for accurate calculations.
2. **Output Paint**: The problem assumes an output of 1斗2升, which is converted into a fraction (12/10斗).
3. **Oil Obtained**: Using the rate of exchange, the amount of oil obtained is calculated.
4. **Remaining Paint and Mixing**: The remaining paint is calculated, and the mixed paint is computed by adding the paint equivalent of the obtained oil.
5. **Conversion to Dou and Sheng**: The mixed paint is split into whole dou and fractional sheng for the final answer.

### Final Values:
- `a`: Output paint in dou.
- `b`: Obtained oil in dou.
- `c`: Whole dou part of the mixed paint.
- `d`: Sheng part of the mixed paint.
