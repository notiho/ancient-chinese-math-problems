"""
今有粟四斗五升，欲為鑿米。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求鑿米，十二之，二十五而一。
荅曰：為鑿米 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to compute the amount of "鑿米" (polished rice) obtained from "粟" (unpolished grain). The problem states that for every 25 units of unpolished grain, 12 units of polished rice are obtained. The total amount of unpolished grain is 4斗5升, where 1斗 = 10升.

### Step-by-step solution:
1. Convert the total amount of unpolished grain into a single unit (升).
   - 4斗 = 4 × 10升 = 40升.
   - 4斗5升 = 40升 + 5升 = 45升.

2. Use the given ratio (25 unpolished grain : 12 polished rice) to calculate the amount of polished rice.
   - For every 25升 of unpolished grain, 12升 of polished rice is obtained.
   - Therefore, the amount of polished rice is: \( \text{polished rice} = \frac{12}{25} \times \text{unpolished grain} \).

3. Convert the result back into 斗 and 升.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total unpolished grain in 升
unpolished_grain = 4 * 10 + 5  # 4斗5升 = 45升

# Ratio of polished rice to unpolished grain
ratio = Fraction(12, 25)

# Calculate polished rice in 升
polished_rice_in_sheng = ratio * unpolished_grain

# Convert polished rice into 斗 and 升
a_dou = polished_rice_in_sheng // 10  # 1斗 = 10升
a_sheng = polished_rice_in_sheng % 10

# Final result
a = (a_dou, a_sheng)  # a is represented as (斗, 升)


"""


### Explanation of the result:
- `a_dou` gives the number of 斗 of polished rice.
- `a_sheng` gives the remaining 升 of polished rice.
- The final result `a` is a tuple representing the amount of polished rice in 斗 and 升.
