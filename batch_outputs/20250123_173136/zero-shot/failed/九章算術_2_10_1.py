今有粟三斗少半升，欲為菽。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求菽、答、麻、麥，皆九之，十而一。
荅曰：為菽 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve the problem, we need to compute the amount of 菽 (a斗) obtained from 粟 (3斗少半升). The given rule states that to convert 粟 to 菽, we multiply by 9 and divide by 10.

### Explanation:
1 斗 = 10 升.  
"3斗少半升" means \( 3斗 - 0.5升 \), which is \( 3 \times 10 - 0.5 = 30 - 0.5 = 29.5升 \).  

To convert 粟 to 菽, we multiply by 9 and divide by 10. Let's calculate this in Python.


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 粟 in terms of 升
粟 = Fraction(29.5)  # 3斗少半升 = 29.5升

# Conversion rule: multiply by 9 and divide by 10
a = 粟 * Fraction(9, 10)

# Result in terms of 斗
a = a / 10  # Convert back to 斗 (1斗 = 10升)

# a now holds the amount of 菽 in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 菽 in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 273/100, Actual: 531/200"""
