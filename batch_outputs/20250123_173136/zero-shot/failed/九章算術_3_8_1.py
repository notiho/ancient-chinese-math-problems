今有甲持粟三升，乙持糲米三升，丙持糲飯三升。欲令合而分之，問︰各幾何？
返衰術曰：列置衰而令相乘，動者為不動者衰。術曰：以粟率五十、糲米率三十、糲飯率七十五為衰、而返衰之，副并為法。以九升乘未并者各自為實。實如法得一升。
荅曰：甲 a升 。乙 b升 。丙 c升 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves redistributing three types of grains (粟, 糲米, 糲飯) based on their respective rates (粟 rate = 50, 糲米 rate = 30, 糲飯 rate = 75). The total quantity is 9升, and we need to compute how much each person (甲, 乙, 丙) receives.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Rates for each type of grain
rate_a = 50  # 粟 rate
rate_b = 30  # 糲米 rate
rate_c = 75  # 糲飯 rate

# Initial quantities held by 甲, 乙, 丙
quantity_a = 3  # 粟 (升)
quantity_b = 3  # 糲米 (升)
quantity_c = 3  # 糲飯 (升)

# Compute the total "value" of the grains based on their rates
total_value = quantity_a * rate_a + quantity_b * rate_b + quantity_c * rate_c

# Each person should receive an equal share of the total value
share_value = Fraction(total_value, 3)

# Compute the amount each person receives in terms of volume (升)
a = Fraction(share_value, rate_a)
b = Fraction(share_value, rate_b)
c = Fraction(share_value, rate_c)

# Results
a, b, c


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Rates**: Each type of grain has a specific rate (value per unit volume).
2. **Total Value**: The total value of all grains is calculated by multiplying the quantity of each type by its rate and summing them up.
3. **Equal Share**: Each person receives an equal share of the total value.
4. **Redistribution**: The amount each person receives in terms of volume is calculated by dividing their share of the value by the rate of the grain.

### Output:
The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will contain the volumes (in 升) that 甲, 乙, and 丙 receive, respectively.
