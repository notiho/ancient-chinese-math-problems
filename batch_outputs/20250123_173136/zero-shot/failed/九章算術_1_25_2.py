又有圭田廣五步、二分步之一，從八步、三分步之二。問：為田幾何？
術曰：半廣以乘正從。
荅曰： a步 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of a rectangular field (圭田). The problem gives the width (廣) as \(5 + \frac{1}{2}\) steps (步) and the length (正) as \(8 + \frac{2}{3}\) steps (步). The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length}
\]

Here is the Python code to compute the area:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given dimensions
width = Fraction(5) + Fraction(1, 2)  # 5 + 1/2
length = Fraction(8) + Fraction(2, 3)  # 8 + 2/3

# Calculate the area
a = width * length  # Area in steps^2

# The result is stored in variable 'a'


"""


The variable `a` will contain the area of the field in steps squared (步²).
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 143/6, Actual: 143/3"""
