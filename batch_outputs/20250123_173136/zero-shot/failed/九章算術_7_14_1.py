今有漆三得油四，油四和漆五。今有漆三斗，欲令分以易油，還自和餘漆。問︰出漆、得油、和漆各幾何？
術曰：假令出漆九升，不足六升。令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰：出漆 a斗 ，得油 b斗 ，和漆 c斗 ， d升 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves determining the amount of lacquer ("漆") exchanged for oil ("油"), and the remaining lacquer after the exchange. The solution involves using the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficit Method), which is a classical Chinese mathematical technique.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
rate_lacquer_to_oil = Fraction(3, 4)  # 3 units of lacquer yield 4 units of oil
rate_oil_to_lacquer = Fraction(4, 5)  # 4 units of oil yield 5 units of lacquer
initial_lacquer = Fraction(3, 1)  # 3斗 of lacquer

# Step 1: Assume an exchange rate and calculate excess and deficit
assumed_lacquer_out = Fraction(9, 10)  # 9升 (1斗 = 10升)
excess = Fraction(6, 10)  # 6升
assumed_lacquer_out_2 = Fraction(12, 10)  # 1斗2升 = 12升
deficit = Fraction(2, 10)  # 2升

# Step 2: Apply the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficit Method)
# Formula: (assumed_rate_1 * deficit + assumed_rate_2 * excess) / (excess + deficit)
lacquer_out = (assumed_lacquer_out * deficit + assumed_lacquer_out_2 * excess) / (excess + deficit)

# Step 3: Calculate the amount of oil received
oil_received = lacquer_out * rate_lacquer_to_oil

# Step 4: Calculate the remaining lacquer
remaining_lacquer = initial_lacquer - lacquer_out + oil_received * rate_oil_to_lacquer

# Step 5: Convert remaining lacquer into 斗 and 升
remaining_lacquer_dou = int(remaining_lacquer)  # Whole number part in 斗
remaining_lacquer_sheng = (remaining_lacquer - remaining_lacquer_dou) * 10  # Fractional part in 升

# Assign results to variables
a = lacquer_out  # 出漆
b = oil_received  # 得油
c = remaining_lacquer_dou  # 和漆 (斗)
d = remaining_lacquer_sheng  # 和漆 (升)

# Results
a, b, c, d

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Data**: The exchange rates and initial amount of lacquer are given in the problem.
2. **Assumptions**: Two assumptions are made for the amount of lacquer exchanged, and the corresponding excess and deficit are calculated.
3. **Excess and Deficit Method**: The formula for the method is applied to calculate the actual amount of lacquer exchanged.
4. **Oil Received**: The amount of oil received is calculated based on the exchange rate.
5. **Remaining Lacquer**: The remaining lacquer is calculated by subtracting the lacquer exchanged and adding the lacquer obtained from the oil.
6. **Conversion**: The remaining lacquer is converted into 斗 (whole units) and 升 (fractions of a unit).
7. **Results**: The results are stored in variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

### Final Values:
- `a`: Amount of lacquer exchanged (斗)
- `b`: Amount of oil received (斗)
- `c`: Remaining lacquer (斗)
- `d`: Remaining lacquer (升)
