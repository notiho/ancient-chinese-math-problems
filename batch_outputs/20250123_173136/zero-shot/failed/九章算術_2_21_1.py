今有鑿米三斗、少半升，欲為粟。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以鑿米求粟，二十五之，十二而一。
荅曰：為粟 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of 粟 (millet) obtained from 鑿米 (polished rice). The problem states that the conversion rate is 25:12, meaning 25 units of 鑿米 yield 12 units of 粟. The given amount of 鑿米 is 3斗 and 少半升 (half a 升 less). 

Here is the Python code to compute the value of `a`:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
zhao_mi = Fraction(3) - Fraction(1, 2)  # 3斗 - 半升 (1斗 = 10升, so 半升 = 1/20斗)

# Conversion rate: 25斗 鑿米 -> 12斗 粟
conversion_rate = Fraction(12, 25)

# Calculate 粟
a = zhao_mi * conversion_rate

# Result
a  # 粟 in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 粟 in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 455/72, Actual: 6/5"""
