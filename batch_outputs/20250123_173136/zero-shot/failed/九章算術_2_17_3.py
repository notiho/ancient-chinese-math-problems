"""
今有粟四斗，欲為熟菽。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求熟菽，二百七之，百而一。
荅曰：為熟菽 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem states that 4斗 (a unit of volume) of 粟 (grain) is used to make 熟菽 (cooked beans). The rule for conversion is given as "二百七之，百而一," which means that for every 100 parts of 粟, you get 1 part of 熟菽, and the conversion factor is 1/207.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
粟 = 4  # 粟 in 斗
conversion_factor = Fraction(1, 207)  # Conversion factor from 粟 to 熟菽

# Calculation
a = 粟 * conversion_factor  # 熟菽 in 斗

# Result
a  # 熟菽 in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will contain the result, which is the amount of 熟菽 in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 207/25, Actual: 4/207"""
