今有粺米二斗，欲為粟。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粺米求粟，五十之，二十七而一。
荅曰：為粟 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem states that to convert 粺米 (polished rice) to 粟 (unpolished rice), the conversion ratio is 50:27. This means for every 50 units of 粺米, you get 27 units of 粟. Given that there are 2斗 of 粺米, we need to calculate how many 斗 of 粟 are obtained.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
polished_rice = 2  # 粺米 in 斗
conversion_ratio = Fraction(27, 50)  # Conversion ratio from 粺米 to 粟

# Calculate the amount of 粟
a = polished_rice * conversion_ratio  # 粟 in 斗

# Result
a  # This is the answer in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will contain the value of 粟 in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 100/27, Actual: 27/25"""
