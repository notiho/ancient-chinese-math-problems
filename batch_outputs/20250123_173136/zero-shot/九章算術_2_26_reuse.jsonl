The given amount of \u7cf2\u98ef is 7\u65976\u53474/7\u5347. Since 1\u6597 = 10\u5347, we convert everything into a fraction of \u6597:\n   - 7\u6597 = 7\n   - 6\u5347 = 6/10\u6597\n   - 4/7\u5347 = 4/(7*10)\u6597\n   - Total \u7cf2\u98ef = 7 + 6/10 + 4/(7*10)\n\n2. The conversion rule \"\u516d\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e94\u800c\u4e00\" means for every 6 parts of \u7cf2\u98ef, you get 5 parts of \u98e7. This is represented as multiplying by the fraction 5/6.\n\n3.
