The total weight of all sparrows and swallows is 1\u65a4, which is 16\u5169.\n2. Since there are 5 sparrows and 6 swallows, the total number of birds is 11.\n3.

We need to find the weight of one sparrow (`a` \u4e24) and one swallow (`b` \u4e24).\n\nWe will use the `Fraction` class to handle the calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Total weight of 5 sparrows and 6 swallows is 1 jin (16 \u4e24 per jin)\ntotal_weight = Fraction(16)  # in \u4e24\n\n# Weight of 1 sparrow = a \u4e24, weight of 1 swallow = b \u4e24\n# Equation 1: 5a + 6b = 16\n# Equation 2: a = b (from the balance condition)\n\n# Solving the equations\n# From Equation 2: a = b\n# Substitute a = b into Equation 1: 5a + 6a = 16\n# Simplify: 11a = 16\na = total_weight / 11  # a = 16 / 11 \u4e24\nb = a  # b = a\n\n# Results\nprint(f\"Weight of one sparrow (a): {a} \u4e24\")\nprint(f\"Weight of one swallow (b): {b} \u4e24\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1.

Substituting `a = b` into the total weight equation `5a + 6b = 16`, we get `11a = 16`.\n4. Solving for `a`, we find `a = 16 / 11`.\n5.
