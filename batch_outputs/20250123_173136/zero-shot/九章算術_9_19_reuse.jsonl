The problem involves finding the side length of a square-shaped city (\"\u9091\u65b9\") based on the given distances. Let's compute the solution step by step.\n\n### Problem Breakdown:\n1. The city is square-shaped, and its side length is unknown (`a`).\n2. From the north gate, walking 20 steps north leads to a tree.\n3. From the south gate, walking 14 steps south and then 1775 steps west leads to the same tree.\n4. The formula provided is:\n   - Multiply the north gate steps (20) by the westward steps (1775), double the result, and add the south gate steps (14).\n   - Take the square root of this result to find the side length of the square (`a`).\n\n### Python Code:\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nnorth_steps = 20  # steps north from the north gate\nsouth_steps = 14  # steps south from the south gate\nwest_steps = 1775  # steps west after walking south\n\n# Compute the area-related value\nnumerator = 2 * north_steps * west_steps + south_steps\n\n# Compute the side length of the square (a)\na = math.sqrt(numerator)\n\n# Result\na = Fraction(a).limit_denominator()  # Represent as a fraction if necessary\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. `north_steps` is the number of steps north from the north gate (20).\n2. `south_steps` is the number of steps south from the south gate (14).\n3. `west_steps` is the number of steps west after walking south (1775).\n4. The formula calculates the square's side length (`a`) by taking the square root of the computed value.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe variable `a` contains the side length of the square in steps.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 3, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical procedure into Python code.
