今有粟，三千九百九十九斛九斗六升，凡粟九斗易豆一斛。問：計豆幾何？
術曰：置粟三千九百九十九斛九斗六升為實，以九斗為法。實如法，即得。
答曰： a斛 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many "斛" of beans can be obtained by exchanging the given amount of 粟 (grain). The exchange rate is 9斗 of 粟 for 1斛 of beans.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
粟_in_斛 = 3999  # 粟 in 斛
粟_in_斗 = 9  # 粟 in 斗
粟_in_升 = 6  # 粟 in 升

# Conversion factors
斗_per_斛 = 10  # 10斗 = 1斛
升_per_斗 = 10  # 10升 = 1斗

# Total 粟 in terms of 升
total_升 = (粟_in_斛 * 斗_per_斛 * 升_per_斗) + (粟_in_斗 * 升_per_斗) + 粟_in_升

# Exchange rate: 9斗 of 粟 = 1斛 of beans
粟_per_豆_斛_in_升 = 9 * 升_per_斗  # Convert 9斗 to 升

# Calculate the number of beans (in 斛)
a = Fraction(total_升, 粟_per_豆_斛_in_升)

# The result is stored in variable 'a'
print(a)


"""


### Explanation:
1. Convert all 粟 into the smallest unit, 升 (liters), for easier calculation.
2. Use the exchange rate to determine how many "斛" of beans can be obtained.
3. Use the `Fraction` class to ensure precise calculations, even if the result is not an integer.

The solution is stored in the variable `a`.
