今有人盜庫絹，不知所失幾何？但聞草中分絹，人得六匹，盈六匹；人得七匹，不足七匹。問人、絹各幾何？
術曰：先置人得六匹于右上，盈六匹于右下，後置人得七匹于左上，不足七匹于左下，維乘之所得，并之為絹，并盈不足為人。
答曰：賊 a人 ，絹 b匹 。

To solve this problem, we translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the number of people (`a`) and the total amount of silk (`b`) based on the given conditions.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given conditions:
# Each person gets 6 pieces of silk, with 6 pieces left over.
# Each person gets 7 pieces of silk, but 7 pieces are short.

# Let a = number of people
# Let b = total pieces of silk

# Using the method described:
# b = 6 * a + 6 (from the first condition)
# b = 7 * a - 7 (from the second condition)

# Equating the two expressions for b:
# 6 * a + 6 = 7 * a - 7
# Solve for a:
a = Fraction(6 + 7, 7 - 6)

# Substitute a back into one of the equations to find b:
b = 6 * a + 6

# The solution:
a, b


"""


This code calculates the number of people (`a`) and the total pieces of silk (`b`) using the conditions provided. The solution is stored in the variables `a` and `b`.
