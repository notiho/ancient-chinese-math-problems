今有一人一日矯矢五十，一人一日羽矢三十，一人一日筈矢十五。今令一人一日自矯、羽、筈，問︰成矢幾何？
術曰：矯矢五十，用徒一人。羽矢五十，用徒一人、太半人。筈矢五十，用徒三人、少半人。并之，得六人，以為法。以五十矢為實。實如法得一矢。
荅曰： a矢 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating how many arrows ("a") one person can complete in one day when they perform all tasks (矯, 羽, 筈) themselves.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Define the rates of work for each task
矯_rate = 50  # One person can straighten 50 arrows in one day
羽_rate = 30  # One person can feather 30 arrows in one day
筈_rate = 15  # One person can notch 15 arrows in one day

# Calculate the total work required for one arrow
矯_time_per_arrow = Fraction(1, 矯_rate)  # Time to straighten one arrow
羽_time_per_arrow = Fraction(1, 羽_rate)  # Time to feather one arrow
筈_time_per_arrow = Fraction(1, 筈_rate)  # Time to notch one arrow

# Total time per arrow
total_time_per_arrow = 矯_time_per_arrow + 羽_time_per_arrow + 筈_time_per_arrow

# Calculate how many arrows one person can complete in one day
a = Fraction(1, total_time_per_arrow)

# Output the result
a


"""


This code calculates the number of arrows (`a`) one person can complete in one day by summing the time required for each task and then finding the reciprocal to determine the rate of arrow production. The result is stored in the variable `a`.
