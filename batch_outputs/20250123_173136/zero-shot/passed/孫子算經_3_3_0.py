"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of characters (字) in the book. The book has 29 chapters (章), and each chapter contains 63 characters (字). The total number of characters is obtained by multiplying the number of chapters by the number of characters per chapter.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
chapters = 29  # number of chapters
characters_per_chapter = 63  # number of characters per chapter

# Calculate total characters
a = chapters * characters_per_chapter

# Result
a


"""


The variable `a` will hold the total number of characters.
