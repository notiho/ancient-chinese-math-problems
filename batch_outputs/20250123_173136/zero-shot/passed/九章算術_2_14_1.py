今有粟七斗五升、七分升之四，欲為稻。問︰得幾何？

荅曰：為稻 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to convert the given amount of 粟 (millet) into 稻 (rice) using the provided method. The method states: "以粟求稻，六之，五而一," which means multiply the amount of 粟 by 6 and then divide by 5 to get the amount of 稻.

Here is the Python code to compute the value of `a`:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given amount of 粟
粟 = Fraction(7, 1) + Fraction(5, 10) + Fraction(4, 70)  # 7斗5升4/7升

# Conversion method: multiply by 6, then divide by 5
a = 粟 * 6 / 5  # Result in 斗

# The result is stored in variable 'a'
a


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 稻 in 斗.
