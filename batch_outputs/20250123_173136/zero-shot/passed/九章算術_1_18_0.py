"""
To solve this problem, we will compute the area of the field based on the given fractions. The problem states that the field has a width of \( \frac{4}{7} \) of a step and a length of \( \frac{3}{5} \) of a step. The area of the field is the product of these two fractions.

Here is the Python code to compute the value of \( a \):


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given dimensions of the field
width = Fraction(4, 7)  # 4/7 steps
length = Fraction(3, 5)  # 3/5 steps

# Compute the area of the field
a = width * length  # Area in square steps

# The result is stored in variable 'a'


"""


The value of \( a \) will represent the area of the field in square steps.
