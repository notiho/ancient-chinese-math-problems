今有米一千五百七十七斛，斛别加八斗三升。問：計㡬何？
術曰：列米一千五百七十七斛，以加米一斛八斗三升乘之即得。
答曰： a斛 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice when each of the 1,577 "斛" (a unit of volume) is increased by 8 "斗" and 3 "升". 

### Units:
- 1 "斛" = 10 "斗"
- 1 "斗" = 10 "升"

Thus, 8 "斗" and 3 "升" can be converted into "斛" as follows:
\[ 8 \text{斗} + 3 \text{升} = \frac{8}{10} \text{斛} + \frac{3}{100} \text{斛} = \frac{83}{100} \text{斛} \]

Now, the total amount of rice is calculated by multiplying the number of "斛" (1,577) by the increase per "斛" (\(1 + \frac{83}{100}\)).

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
initial_rice = 1577  # in 斛
increase_per_hu = Fraction(83, 100)  # 8斗3升 converted to 斛

# Total rice calculation
a = initial_rice * (1 + increase_per_hu)

# Result
a


"""


The variable `a` will contain the total amount of rice in "斛".
