"""
To solve this problem, we calculate the total area occupied by the given number of carriages, where each carriage occupies 3 steps of land. Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
carriages = 23900  # Number of carriages
steps_per_carriage = 3  # Steps occupied by each carriage

# Calculation
a = carriages * steps_per_carriage  # Total steps of land occupied


"""


The solution is stored in the variable `a`, which represents the total steps of land occupied.
