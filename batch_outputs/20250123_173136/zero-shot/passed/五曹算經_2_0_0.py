今有丁二萬三千六百九十二人，責兵五千九百二十三人。問：㡬何丁出一兵？
術曰：列二萬三千六百九十二人，以五千九百二十三除之即得。
答曰： a 丁出一兵。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many 丁 (people) are required to provide one 兵 (soldier). This is done by dividing the total number of 丁 by the total number of 兵.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total 丁 and total 兵
total_ding = 23692
total_bing = 5923

# Calculate how many 丁 are needed for one 兵
a = Fraction(total_ding, total_bing)

# The result is stored in variable 'a'


"""


The value of `a` represents how many 丁 are required to provide one 兵.
