今有環田，中周九十二步，外周一百二十二步，徑五步。問：為田幾何？
術曰：并中外周而半之，以徑乘之為積步。
荅曰： a畝 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of a circular ring-shaped field (環田). The problem provides the inner circumference (中周), the outer circumference (外周), and the diameter (徑). The formula for the area of the ring is given in the problem: 

1. Add the inner and outer circumferences together.
2. Divide the sum by 2 to get the average circumference.
3. Multiply the average circumference by the diameter to get the area in square steps (積步).
4. Convert the area from square steps to 畝 (a traditional Chinese unit of area), where 1 畝 = 240 square steps.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
inner_circumference = 92  # 中周 (steps)
outer_circumference = 122  # 外周 (steps)
diameter = 5  # 徑 (steps)

# Step-by-step calculations
average_circumference = Fraction(inner_circumference + outer_circumference, 2)  # Average circumference
area_in_square_steps = average_circumference * diameter  # Area in square steps
a = area_in_square_steps / 240  # Convert square steps to 畝

# The result is stored in variable 'a'


"""


The variable `a` will contain the area of the field in 畝 as a `Fraction`.
