今有粟一十斗八升、五分升之二，欲為麥。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求菽、答、麻、麥，皆九之，十而一。
荅曰：為麥 a斗 。

To solve this problem, we need to convert 粟 (millet) into 麥 (wheat). The rule provided states that to convert 粟 into 麥, we multiply the amount of 粟 by \( \frac{9}{10} \).

The given amount of 粟 is \( 10 \) 斗 \( 8 \) 升 \( \frac{2}{5} \) 升. First, we need to express this amount entirely in terms of 升. Since \( 1 \) 斗 = \( 10 \) 升, the total amount in 升 is:

\[
10 \times 10 + 8 + \frac{2}{5} = 100 + 8 + \frac{2}{5} = 108 + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{540}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{542}{5} \text{ 升}.
\]

Next, we convert this amount of 粟 into 麥 by multiplying by \( \frac{9}{10} \):

\[
\text{Amount of 麥 in 升} = \frac{542}{5} \times \frac{9}{10} = \frac{542 \times 9}{5 \times 10} = \frac{4878}{50} \text{ 升}.
\]

Finally, we convert this back into 斗 and 升. Since \( 1 \) 斗 = \( 10 \) 升, we divide \( \frac{4878}{50} \) by \( 10 \):

\[
\text{Amount of 麥 in 斗} = \frac{4878}{50 \times 10} = \frac{4878}{500} = \frac{2439}{250} \text{ 斗}.
\]

Thus, the answer is \( a = \frac{2439}{250} \) 斗.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given amount of 粟
粟_in_斗 = 10
粟_in_升 = 8
粟_in_分升 = Fraction(2, 5)

# Convert 粟 to total 升
total_粟_in_升 = 粟_in_斗 * 10 + 粟_in_升 + 粟_in_分升

# Conversion factor from 粟 to 麥
conversion_factor = Fraction(9, 10)

# Convert 粟 to 麥 in 升
total_麥_in_升 = total_粟_in_升 * conversion_factor

# Convert 麥 from 升 to 斗
a = total_麥_in_升 / 10

# Result
a  # This is the amount of 麥 in 斗
