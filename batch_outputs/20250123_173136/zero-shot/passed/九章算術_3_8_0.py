今有甲持粟三升，乙持糲米三升，丙持糲飯三升。欲令合而分之，問︰各幾何？
返衰術曰：列置衰而令相乘，動者為不動者衰。術曰：以粟率五十、糲米率三十、糲飯率七十五為衰、而返衰之，副并為法。以九升乘未并者各自為實。實如法得一升。
荅曰：甲 a升 。乙 b升 。丙 c升 。

To solve this problem, we need to distribute the total of 9升 (liters) among three people (甲, 乙, 丙) based on the given rates: 粟 (millet) at a rate of 50, 糲米 (coarse rice) at a rate of 30, and 糲飯 (coarse cooked rice) at a rate of 75. The solution involves using the "返衰術" (inverse proportion method).

Here is the Python code to compute the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Rates for 粟, 糲米, and 糲飯
rate_a = 50  # 粟 rate
rate_b = 30  # 糲米 rate
rate_c = 75  # 糲飯 rate

# Total volume to distribute
total_volume = 9  # in 升

# Compute the inverse of the rates (返衰)
inverse_a = Fraction(1, rate_a)
inverse_b = Fraction(1, rate_b)
inverse_c = Fraction(1, rate_c)

# Sum of the inverses
sum_of_inverses = inverse_a + inverse_b + inverse_c

# Compute the shares for each person
a = total_volume * inverse_a / sum_of_inverses
b = total_volume * inverse_b / sum_of_inverses
c = total_volume * inverse_c / sum_of_inverses

# Results
a, b, c


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Rates and Inverse Proportions**:
   - The rates for 粟, 糲米, and 糲飯 are 50, 30, and 75, respectively.
   - The inverse of each rate is used to determine the proportional share.

2. **Sum of Inverses**:
   - The sum of the inverses of the rates is calculated to normalize the shares.

3. **Shares**:
   - Each person's share is calculated as the total volume multiplied by their inverse rate, divided by the sum of all inverses.

### Output:
The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will contain the respective shares of 甲, 乙, and 丙 in 升 (liters).
