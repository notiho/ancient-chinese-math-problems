術曰：列二萬三千六百九十二人，以五千九百二十三除之即得。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many "丁" (people) are required to produce one "兵" (soldier). The problem states that there are 23,692 people and 5,923 soldiers. The solution involves dividing the total number of people by the total number of soldiers.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_people = 23692  # Total number of people (丁)
total_soldiers = 5923  # Total number of soldiers (兵)

# Calculate how many people (丁) are required for one soldier (兵)
a = Fraction(total_people, total_soldiers)

# The result is stored in variable 'a'


"""


The value of `a` represents how many "丁" are required to produce one "兵".
