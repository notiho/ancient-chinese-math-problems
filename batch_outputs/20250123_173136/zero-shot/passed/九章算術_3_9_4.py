今有絲一斤，價直二百四十。今有錢一千三百二十八，問︰得絲幾何？
術曰：以一斤價數為法，以一斤乘今有錢數為實，實如法得絲數。
荅曰： a斤 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will calculate the amount of silk (denoted as "a") that can be purchased with 1328 units of money, given that 1 jin (斤) of silk costs 240 units of money. Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
price_per_jin = 240  # price of 1 jin of silk
total_money = 1328   # total money available

# Calculation
a = Fraction(total_money, price_per_jin)  # amount of silk in jin

# Result
a  # a is the amount of silk in jin


"""


The variable `a` will hold the result in jin.
