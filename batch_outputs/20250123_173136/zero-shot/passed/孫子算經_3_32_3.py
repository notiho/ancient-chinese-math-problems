今有出門望見九堤，堤有九木，木有九枝，枝有九巢，巢有九禽，禽有九雛，雛有九毛，毛有九色。問：各幾何？
術曰：置九堤以九乘之，得木之數；又以九乘之，得枝之數；又以九乘之，得巢之數；又以九乘之，得禽之數；又以九乘之，得雛之數；又以九乘之，得毛之數；又以九乘之，得色之數。
答曰：木 a枝 ， b 巢， c 禽， d 雛， e 毛， f 色， g 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will compute the values step by step as described in the problem. Each step involves multiplying the previous result by 9. Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Initial value for 堤 (dike)
堤 = 9

# Compute the values step by step
木 = 堤 * 9
枝 = 木 * 9
巢 = 枝 * 9
禽 = 巢 * 9
雛 = 禽 * 9
毛 = 雛 * 9
色 = 毛 * 9

# Assign the results to the variables in the answer
a = 木
b = 枝
c = 巢
d = 禽
e = 雛
f = 毛
g = 色

# The results are now stored in variables a, b, c, d, e, f, g


"""


### Explanation:
1. Start with the initial value of 堤 = 9.
2. Multiply 堤 by 9 to get 木.
3. Multiply 木 by 9 to get 枝.
4. Multiply 枝 by 9 to get 巢.
5. Multiply 巢 by 9 to get 禽.
6. Multiply 禽 by 9 to get 雛.
7. Multiply 雛 by 9 to get 毛.
8. Multiply 毛 by 9 to get 色.

The final values are stored in variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, and `g`.
