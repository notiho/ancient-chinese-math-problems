"""
To solve this problem, we will compute the value of "a" as described in the text. Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given length in steps
length_in_steps = 5794

# Divide the length by 4
a = Fraction(length_in_steps, 4)

# Result
a  # This is the value of "a" in steps


"""


The variable `a` will contain the result in steps as a fraction.
