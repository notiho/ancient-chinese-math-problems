今有米在十斗桶中，不知其數。滿中添粟而舂之，得米七斗。問︰故米幾何？
術曰：以盈不足術求之，假令故米二斗，不足二升。令之三斗，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰： a斗 。

To solve this problem, we will use the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method). Here's how we can translate the problem into Python code:

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We are given a bucket with a capacity of 10斗 (dou). Initially, there is an unknown amount of rice in it.
2. When the bucket is filled with millet and then processed, the resulting rice is 7斗.
3. Two test cases are provided:
   - If the initial rice is assumed to be 2斗, the result is short by 2升 (sheng).
   - If the initial rice is assumed to be 3斗, the result exceeds by 2升.

We need to calculate the actual amount of rice (denoted as `a` in the answer).

### Units:
1斗 = 10升.

### Solution:
Using the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method):
1. Let the assumed amounts of rice be `x1 = 2斗` and `x2 = 3斗`.
2. Let the deficiencies and excesses be `d1 = -2升` and `d2 = +2升`.
3. Convert these to the same unit (升): `x1 = 20升`, `x2 = 30升`, `d1 = -2升`, `d2 = +2升`.
4. The formula for the unknown is:
   \[
   a = \frac{x1 \cdot d2 - x2 \cdot d1}{d2 - d1}
   \]

### Python Code:

"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
x1 = 20  # 2斗 in 升
x2 = 30  # 3斗 in 升
d1 = -2  # -2升
d2 = 2   # +2升

# Calculate the unknown amount of rice (a) in 升
a = Fraction(x1 * d2 - x2 * d1, d2 - d1)

# Convert back to 斗 (1斗 = 10升)
a = a / 10

# The result is stored in variable `a`
a


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. Convert all quantities to the same unit (升).
2. Apply the formula for the "盈不足術" to compute the unknown amount of rice in 升.
3. Convert the result back to 斗 for the final answer.

### Final Answer:
The value of `a` will be the amount of rice in 斗.
