今有兵一千三百六十二人，人給絹二丈八尺五寸。問：計㡬何？
術曰：列兵一千三百六十二人，以絹二十八尺五寸乘之，得三萬八千八百一十七尺，以四十尺除之即得。
答曰： a疋 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many bolts of silk ("疋") are required for 1,362 soldiers, where each soldier is given 2丈8尺5寸 of silk. In ancient Chinese measurements:

1 丈 = 10 尺  
1 尺 = 10 寸  
1 疋 = 40 尺  

### Steps:
1. Convert 2丈8尺5寸 into 尺:
   \( 2丈 = 20尺 \), so \( 2丈8尺5寸 = 20 + 8 + \frac{5}{10} = 28.5尺 \).
2. Multiply the total number of soldiers (1,362) by the amount of silk each soldier gets (28.5 尺).
3. Divide the total silk required by 40 尺 (1 疋) to find the number of bolts of silk.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
soldiers = 1362
silk_per_soldier = Fraction(28, 1) + Fraction(5, 10)  # 28.5 尺
silk_per_bolt = 40  # 1 疋 = 40 尺

# Total silk required in 尺
total_silk = soldiers * silk_per_soldier

# Calculate the number of bolts (疋)
a = total_silk / silk_per_bolt

# Result
a  # This is the answer in 疋


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
- `silk_per_soldier` is calculated as \( 28 + \frac{5}{10} \) to represent 28.5 尺.
- `total_silk` is the total amount of silk required for all soldiers.
- `a` is the number of bolts of silk, calculated by dividing the total silk by 40 尺 per bolt.

The value of `a` will be the number of bolts of silk required.
