今有出錢五百七十六，買竹七十八箇。欲其大小率之，問︰各幾何？
其率術曰：各置所買石、鈞、斤、兩以為法，以所率乘錢數為實，實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法賤實貴。
荅曰：其 a箇 ，箇 b錢 。其 c箇 ，箇 d錢 。

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of items of two types (a and c) and their respective costs (b and d). The total cost is 576, and the total number of items is 78. Here's the Python code to compute the values:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total money and total items
total_money = 576
total_items = 78

# Let the cost of the first type of item be b and the second type be d
# Assume b = 7 and d = 8 (as an example of rates)
b = 7
d = 8

# Solve for the number of items of each type (a and c)
# a * b + c * d = total_money
# a + c = total_items

# Express c in terms of a: c = total_items - a
# Substitute into the total_money equation:
# a * b + (total_items - a) * d = total_money
# a * b + total_items * d - a * d = total_money
# a * (b - d) = total_money - total_items * d
# a = (total_money - total_items * d) / (b - d)

a = Fraction(total_money - total_items * d, b - d)
c = total_items - a

# Print the results
a = int(a)  # Convert to integer
c = int(c)  # Convert to integer

print(f"a箇 = {a}, 箇 b錢 = {b}")
print(f"c箇 = {c}, 箇 d錢 = {d}")


"""


This code calculates the number of items of each type (`a` and `c`) and their respective costs (`b` and `d`). Note that `b` and `d` are assumed to be 7 and 8, respectively, based on the problem's context. You can adjust these rates as needed.
