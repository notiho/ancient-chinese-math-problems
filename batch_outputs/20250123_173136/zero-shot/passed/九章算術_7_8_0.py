今有米在十斗桶中，不知其數。滿中添粟而舂之，得米七斗。問︰故米幾何？
術曰：以盈不足術求之，假令故米二斗，不足二升。令之三斗，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰： a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will use the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method). The problem involves determining the amount of rice originally in the bucket, given the following conditions:

1. If we assume the original rice is 2斗, it is 2升 short of making 7斗 after adding millet and pounding.
2. If we assume the original rice is 3斗, it exceeds 7斗 by 2升 after adding millet and pounding.

Let us translate this into Python code to compute the value of "a" (the original amount of rice in 斗).


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
rate1 = Fraction(2)  # Assumed original rice in the first case (斗)
deficiency1 = Fraction(2, 10)  # Shortfall in the first case (2升 = 2/10斗)

rate2 = Fraction(3)  # Assumed original rice in the second case (斗)
excess2 = Fraction(2, 10)  # Excess in the second case (2升 = 2/10斗)

# 盈不足術 (Excess and Deficiency Method)
# Compute the numerator (實)
numerator = rate1 * excess2 + rate2 * deficiency1

# Compute the denominator (法)
denominator = excess2 + deficiency1

# Compute the original amount of rice (a)
a = numerator / denominator

# Output the result
a  # This is the original amount of rice in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will hold the solution to the problem, representing the original amount of rice in the bucket in terms of 斗.
