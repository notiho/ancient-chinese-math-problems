今有丁二萬三千六百九十二人，責兵五千九百二十三人。問：㡬何丁出一兵？
術曰：列二萬三千六百九十二人，以五千九百二十三除之即得。
答曰： a 丁出一兵。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many 丁 (people) are required to provide one 兵 (soldier). The total number of people is 23692, and the total number of soldiers required is 5923. We divide the total number of people by the total number of soldiers to find the answer.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total number of people (丁)
total_people = 23692

# Total number of soldiers (兵)
total_soldiers = 5923

# Calculate how many 丁 are required to provide one 兵
a = Fraction(total_people, total_soldiers)

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'


"""


The value of `a` represents how many 丁 are required to provide one 兵.
