今有上禾三秉，益實六斗，當下禾十秉。下禾五秉，益實一斗，當上禾二秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾三秉正，下禾一十秉負，益實六斗負。次置上禾二秉負，下禾五秉正，益實一斗負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a斗 ，下禾一秉實 b斗 。

To solve the problem, we translate the ancient Chinese math problem into a system of linear equations and solve for the unknowns \(a\) and \(b\), which represent the amount of grain in one秉 (bundle) of 上禾 (upper grain) and 下禾 (lower grain), respectively.

The problem gives us the following equations:
1. \(3a - 10b = -6\)
2. \(-2a + 5b = -1\)

We will solve this system of equations using Python code.

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the equations
# 3a - 10b = -6
# -2a + 5b = -1

# Step 1: Solve for b in terms of a using the second equation
# -2a + 5b = -1
# 5b = 2a - 1
# b = (2a - 1) / 5

# Step 2: Substitute b into the first equation
# 3a - 10b = -6
# 3a - 10((2a - 1) / 5) = -6
# Multiply through by 5 to eliminate the fraction
# 15a - 20a + 10 = -30
# -5a + 10 = -30
# -5a = -40
# a = 8

# Step 3: Solve for b using the value of a
# b = (2a - 1) / 5
# b = (2(8) - 1) / 5
# b = (16 - 1) / 5
# b = 15 / 5
# b = 3

# Assign the solutions to variables
a = Fraction(8)  # 上禾一秉實
b = Fraction(3)  # 下禾一秉實

# Results
a, b

### Explanation of the Code
1. We start by defining the two equations given in the problem.
2. We solve for \(b\) in terms of \(a\) using the second equation.
3. We substitute \(b\) into the first equation to solve for \(a\).
4. Once \(a\) is found, we substitute it back into the expression for \(b\) to find its value.
5. The solutions are stored in variables \(a\) and \(b\), which represent the amount of grain in one秉 of 上禾 and 下禾, respectively.

### Final Answer
- \(a = 8\)斗 (上禾一秉實)
- \(b = 3\)斗 (下禾一秉實)
