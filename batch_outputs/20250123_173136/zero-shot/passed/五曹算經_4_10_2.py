今有半壁聚粟下周三十六尺高四尺五寸。問：粟㡬何？
術曰：列下周三十六尺自相乘得一千二百九十六尺以高四尺五寸乘之得五千八百三十二尺以十八除之得三百二十四尺以斛法一尺六寸二分除之即得。
答曰： a斛 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the volume of a half-sphere filled with grain, given its circumference and height. The solution involves using the formula for the volume of a sphere and dividing it by 2 (since it's a half-sphere). The units are in "斛" (a traditional Chinese unit of volume).

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
circumference = 36  # in 尺
height = Fraction(4, 1) + Fraction(5, 10)  # 4 尺 5 寸 converted to 尺
radius = circumference / (2 * 3.141592653589793)  # Calculate radius from circumference

# Volume of a sphere is (4/3) * π * r^3, but we only need half of it
# Volume of half-sphere = (1/2) * (4/3) * π * r^3
# Using the given formula in the problem:
volume = Fraction(circumference**2) * height / 18  # in cubic 尺

# Conversion factor: 1 斛 = 1 尺 6 寸 2 分 = 1 + 6/10 + 2/100 = 1.62 尺
conversion_factor = Fraction(162, 100)  # 1.62 尺

# Calculate the amount of grain in 斛
a = volume / conversion_factor

# The result
a  # in 斛


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of grain in "斛".
