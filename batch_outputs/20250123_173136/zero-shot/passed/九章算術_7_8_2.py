今有米在十斗桶中，不知其數。滿中添粟而舂之，得米七斗。問︰故米幾何？
術曰：以盈不足術求之，假令故米二斗，不足二升。令之三斗，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰： a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will use the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method). Here's how we can translate the problem into Python code:

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We are trying to find the amount of rice (故米, denoted as `a` in the answer).
2. When we assume the rice is 2斗, it is insufficient by 2升.
3. When we assume the rice is 3斗, it exceeds by 2升.
4. Using the Excess and Deficiency Method, we calculate the actual amount of rice.

### Python Code:

"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
rate1 = Fraction(2)  # Assumed amount of rice in the first case (斗)
deficiency = Fraction(2, 10)  # Insufficient by 2升 (1斗 = 10升)

rate2 = Fraction(3)  # Assumed amount of rice in the second case (斗)
excess = Fraction(2, 10)  # Exceeds by 2升 (1斗 = 10升)

# Excess and Deficiency Method
# Formula: a = (rate1 * excess + rate2 * deficiency) / (excess + deficiency)
a = (rate1 * excess + rate2 * deficiency) / (excess + deficiency)

# Output the result
a  # The amount of rice in 斗


"""


### Explanation:
1. `rate1` and `rate2` are the assumed amounts of rice in the two cases.
2. `deficiency` and `excess` are the amounts by which the assumptions are incorrect, converted into fractions of a 斗 (since 1斗 = 10升).
3. The formula for the Excess and Deficiency Method is applied to compute the actual amount of rice (`a`).

### Solution:
The value of `a` will be computed as a `Fraction` representing the amount of rice in 斗.
