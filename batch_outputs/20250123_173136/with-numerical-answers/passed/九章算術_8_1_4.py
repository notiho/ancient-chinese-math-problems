今有上禾七秉，損實一斗，益之下禾二秉，而實一十斗。下禾八秉，益實一斗與上禾二秉，而實一十斗。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程。損之曰益，益之曰損。損實一斗者，其實過一十斗也。益實一斗者，其實不滿一十斗也。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a(=35/26)斗 ，下禾一秉實 b(=41/52)斗 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations to determine the yield of one stalk of upper millet (*上禾*) and one stalk of lower millet (*下禾*). The procedure describes a method similar to Gaussian elimination to solve the equations. Let's translate the problem and procedure into Python code.

### Problem Description:
There are 7 stalks of upper millet (*上禾*), which lose 1 dou of yield, and when 2 stalks of lower millet (*下禾*) are added, the total yield is 10 dou.  
There are 8 stalks of lower millet (*下禾*), which gain 1 dou of yield, and when 2 stalks of upper millet (*上禾*) are added, the total yield is 10 dou.  
Question: What is the yield of one stalk of upper millet and one stalk of lower millet?

### Procedure:
The procedure describes how to set up and solve the system of equations using elimination. The equations are:
1. \( 7x - 1 + 2y = 10 \)
2. \( 8y + 1 + 2x = 10 \)

Where \( x \) is the yield of one stalk of upper millet (*上禾*), and \( y \) is the yield of one stalk of lower millet (*下禾*).

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Equation 1: 7x - 1 + 2y = 10
# Rearrange: 7x + 2y = 11
eq1_upper_coeff = 7  # Coefficient of x in equation 1
eq1_lower_coeff = 2  # Coefficient of y in equation 1
eq1_constant = 11    # Constant term in equation 1

# Equation 2: 8y + 1 + 2x = 10
# Rearrange: 2x + 8y = 9
eq2_upper_coeff = 2  # Coefficient of x in equation 2
eq2_lower_coeff = 8  # Coefficient of y in equation 2
eq2_constant = 9     # Constant term in equation 2

# Elimination process:
# Multiply equation 1 by 2 (to match the coefficient of x in equation 2)
# Multiply equation 2 by 7 (to match the coefficient of x in equation 1)
eq1_upper_coeff *= 2
eq1_lower_coeff *= 2
eq1_constant *= 2

eq2_upper_coeff *= 7
eq2_lower_coeff *= 7
eq2_constant *= 7

# Subtract the modified equations to eliminate x
# (14x + 4y = 22) - (14x + 56y = 63)
lower_coeff_diff = eq1_lower_coeff - eq2_lower_coeff  # Coefficient of y
constant_diff = eq1_constant - eq2_constant          # Constant term

# Solve for y (yield of one stalk of lower millet)
y = Fraction(constant_diff, lower_coeff_diff)

# Substitute y back into one of the original equations to solve for x
# Using equation 1: 7x + 2y = 11
x = Fraction(eq1_constant - eq1_lower_coeff * y, eq1_upper_coeff)

# Results:
a = x  # Yield of one stalk of upper millet
b = y  # Yield of one stalk of lower millet

# Output the results
a, b  # a = 35/26, b = 41/52


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. The two equations are set up based on the problem description.
2. The coefficients of \( x \) are matched by multiplying the equations by appropriate factors.
3. Subtraction eliminates \( x \), leaving an equation in terms of \( y \).
4. \( y \) is solved, and its value is substituted back into one of the original equations to solve for \( x \).
5. The results are expressed as fractions for precision.

### Answer:
- The yield of one stalk of upper millet (*上禾*) is \( a = \frac{35}{26} \) dou.
- The yield of one stalk of lower millet (*下禾*) is \( b = \frac{41}{52} \) dou.
