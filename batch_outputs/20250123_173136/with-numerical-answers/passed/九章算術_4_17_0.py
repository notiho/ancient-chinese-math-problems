今有積三百步。問︰為圓周幾何？
開圓術曰：置積步數，以十二乘之，以開方除之，即得周。
荅曰： a(=60)步 。

Suppose there is an area of 300 bu. 
Question: what is the circumference of the circle?

The procedure for opening a circle says: Place the number of bu in the area.
Multiply it by 12.
Divide it by the square root, and the result is the circumference.

Answer: *a*(=60) bu.

# 積三百步

# Since Python does not have a built-in square root function without external libraries, we use an iterative approximation.
