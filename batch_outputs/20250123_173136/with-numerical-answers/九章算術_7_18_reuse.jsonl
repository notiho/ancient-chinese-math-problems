The distance from Qi to Chang'an is 3000 li.\nThe fine horse travels 193 li on the first day, increasing its daily distance by 13 li each day.\nThe slow horse travels 97 li on the first day, decreasing its daily distance by 0.5 li each day.\nThe fine horse reaches Qi first, then returns to meet the slow horse.\nQuestion: after how many days do they meet, and how far does each travel?\n\nThe procedure says: Suppose it takes 15 days, it is short by 337.5 li. Suppose it takes 16 days, it exceeds by 140 li.\nMultiply the surplus and deficit by their respective assumed days, then add them to form the dividend.\nAdd the surplus and deficit to form the divisor.\nDivide the dividend by the divisor to get the number of days.\nIf there is a remainder, divide it by the difference to determine the fraction.\n\nAnswer: *a*(=3000/191) days until they meet. The fine horse travels *b*(=866040/191) li, and the slow horse travels *c*(=279960/191) li.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# \u9f4a\u53bb\u9577\u5b89\u4e09\u5343\u91cc\n\u7e3d\u8ddd\u96e2 = 3000\n\n# \u826f\u99ac\u521d\u65e5\u884c\u4e00\u767e\u4e5d\u5341\u4e09\u91cc\uff0c\u65e5\u589e\u5341\u4e09\u91cc\n\u826f\u99ac\u521d\u65e5 = 193\n\u826f\u99ac\u65e5\u589e = 13\n\n# \u99d1\u99ac\u521d\u65e5\u884c\u4e5d\u5341\u4e03\u91cc\uff0c\u65e5\u6e1b\u534a\u91cc\n\u99d1\u99ac\u521d\u65e5 = 97\n\u99d1\u99ac\u65e5\u6e1b = Fraction(1, 2)\n\n# \u5047\u4ee4\u5341\u4e94\u65e5\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e09\u767e\u4e09\u5341\u4e03\u91cc\u534a\n\u4e0d\u8db3 = Fraction(337.5)\n\u5047\u4ee4_\u4e0d\u8db3 = 15\n\n# \u4ee4\u4e4b\u5341\u516d\u65e5\uff0c\u591a\u4e00\u767e\u56db\u5341\u91cc\n\u76c8 = 140\n\u5047\u4ee4_\u76c8 = 16\n\n# \u4ee5\u76c8\u3001\u4e0d\u8db3\u7dad\u4e58\u5047\u4ee4\u4e4b\u6578\uff0c\u5e76\u800c\u70ba\u5be6\n\u5be6 = (\u76c8 * \u5047\u4ee4_\u4e0d\u8db3) + (\u4e0d\u8db3 * \u5047\u4ee4_\u76c8)\n\n# \u5e76\u76c8\u4e0d\u8db3\u70ba\u6cd5\n\u6cd5 = \u76c8 + \u4e0d\u8db3\n\n# \u5be6\u5982\u6cd5\u800c\u4e00\uff0c\u5f97\u65e5\u6578\n\u65e5\u6578 = Fraction(\u5be6, \u6cd5)\n\n# \u826f\u99ac\u884c\u7684\u7e3d\u8ddd\u96e2\n\u826f\u99ac\u884c\u8ddd\u96e2 = sum(\u826f\u99ac\u521d\u65e5 + i * \u826f\u99ac\u65e5\u589e for i in range(int(\u65e5\u6578)))\n\n# \u99d1\u99ac\u884c\u7684\u7e3d\u8ddd\u96e2\n\u99d1\u99ac\u884c\u8ddd\u96e2 = sum(\u99d1\u99ac\u521d\u65e5 - i * \u99d1\u99ac\u65e5\u6e1b for i in range(int(\u65e5\u6578)))\n\n# \u826f\u99ac\u548c\u99d1\u99ac\u76f8\u9047\na = \u65e5\u6578\nb = Fraction(\u7e3d\u8ddd\u96e2 * 2 )", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2132, "completion_tokens": 3263, "total_tokens": 5395, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_60a3f2dc65"}}, "error": null}
