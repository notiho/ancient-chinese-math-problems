今有大器五、小器一容三斛；大器一、小器五容二斛。問︰大、小器各容幾何？
術曰：假令大器五斗，小器亦五斗，盈一十斗。令之大器五斗五升，小器二斗五升，不足二斗。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰：大器容 a(=13/24)斛 ，小器容 b(=7/24)斛 。

Suppose there are 5 large vessels and 1 small vessel that together hold 3 hu.
Also, 1 large vessel and 5 small vessels together hold 2 hu.
Question: how much does each large vessel and each small vessel hold?

The procedure says: Suppose the large vessel holds 5 dou, and the small vessel also holds 5 dou, making a total of 10 dou.
Suppose the large vessel holds 5 dou and 5 sheng, and the small vessel holds 2 dou and 5 sheng, making a deficit of 2 dou.

The "Surplus and Deficit" procedure says: Place the given rates, with the surplus and deficit each below their respective rates.
Multiply the rates by their respective multipliers, and sum them to form the dividend.
Sum the surplus and deficit to form the divisor.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the result.
If there are fractions, simplify them.
For surplus and deficit problems involving the same goods, place the rates, subtract the smaller from the larger, and simplify the divisor and dividend.
The dividend becomes the price of the goods, and the divisor becomes the number of people.

Answer: Each large vessel holds *a*(=13/24) hu, and each small vessel holds *b*(=7/24) hu.
