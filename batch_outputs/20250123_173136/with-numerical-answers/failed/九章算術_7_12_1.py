今有醇酒一斗，直錢五十；行酒一斗，直錢一十。今將錢三十，得酒二斗。問︰醇、行酒各得幾何？
術曰：假令醇酒五升，行酒一斗五升，有餘一十。令之醇酒二升，行酒一斗八升，不足二。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰：醇酒 a(=5/2)升 ，行酒 b(=7/4)斗 。

Suppose there is pure wine (醇酒) costing 50 qian per dou, and diluted wine (行酒) costing 10 qian per dou.
Now, with 30 qian, one can obtain 2 dou of wine in total.
Question: how much pure wine and diluted wine are obtained respectively?

The procedure says: Suppose there are 5 sheng of pure wine and 1 dou 5 sheng of diluted wine, leaving an excess of 10 qian.
Suppose there are 2 sheng of pure wine and 1 dou 8 sheng of diluted wine, falling short by 2 qian.

The procedure for excess and deficiency (盈不足術) says:
Place the rates of the items, with the excess and deficiency below them respectively.
Multiply the rates by the excess and deficiency, then add them to form the dividend.
Add the excess and deficiency to form the divisor.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the result.
If there are fractions, simplify them.
For items with the same excess or deficiency, place the rates, subtract the smaller from the larger, and simplify the dividend and divisor.
The dividend represents the price of the item, and the divisor represents the quantity.

Answer: *a*(=5/2) sheng of pure wine, and *b*(=7/4) dou of diluted wine.
