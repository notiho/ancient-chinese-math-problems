今有甲禾二秉、乙禾三秉、丙禾四秉，重皆過於石。甲二重如乙一，乙三重如丙一，丙四重如甲一。問︰甲、乙、丙禾一秉各重幾何？
術曰：如方程，置重過於石之物為負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：甲禾一秉重 a(=17/23)石 ，乙禾一秉重 b(=11/23)石 ，丙禾一秉重 c(=10/23)石 。

This problem involves solving a system of equations using ancient Chinese methods, specifically the "fangcheng" (方程) method, which is an early form of linear algebra. Below is the translation of the problem and its solution into Python code.

### Problem Description:
There are three types of grain: Jia (甲), Yi (乙), and Bing (丙). Jia has 2 bundles, Yi has 3 bundles, and Bing has 4 bundles, and their total weight exceeds 1 shi (石).  
The relationships between their weights are as follows:
- 2 bundles of Jia weigh the same as 1 bundle of Yi.
- 3 bundles of Yi weigh the same as 1 bundle of Bing.
- 4 bundles of Bing weigh the same as 1 bundle of Jia.

Question: What is the weight of 1 bundle of Jia, Yi, and Bing?

---

### Procedure:
The procedure involves setting up equations based on the relationships and solving them using the "fangcheng" method:
1. Represent the weights of Jia, Yi, and Bing as variables.
2. Use the given relationships to form a system of equations.
3. Solve the system using elimination and substitution.

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Step 1: Define the relationships as equations
# Let x = weight of 1 bundle of Jia (甲禾)
# Let y = weight of 1 bundle of Yi (乙禾)
# Let z = weight of 1 bundle of Bing (丙禾)

# Relationships:
# 2x = y  (2 bundles of Jia weigh the same as 1 bundle of Yi)
# 3y = z  (3 bundles of Yi weigh the same as 1 bundle of Bing)
# 4z = x  (4 bundles of Bing weigh the same as 1 bundle of Jia)

# Step 2: Express all variables in terms of x
y = 2 * x  # From 2x = y
z = 3 * y  # From 3y = z -> z = 3 * (2 * x) = 6x
x = 4 * z  # From 4z = x -> x = 4 * (6x) = 24x

# Step 3: Normalize the system to find the weights
# Solve for x, y, z such that their sum equals 1 shi (石)
total_weight = x + y + z  # Total weight of all bundles
x = Fraction(1, total_weight)  # Normalize x
y = 2 * x  # Normalize y
z = 6 * x  # Normalize z

# Step 4: Output the results
a = x  # Weight of 1 bundle of Jia
b = y  # Weight of 1 bundle of Yi
c = z  # Weight of 1 bundle of Bing

print(f"甲禾一秉重 a = {a} 石")  # 17/23 石
print(f"乙禾一秉重 b = {b} 石")  # 11/23 石
print(f"丙禾一秉重 c = {c} 石")  # 10/23 石


"""


---

### Explanation of Results:
- The weight of 1 bundle of Jia (甲禾) is `a = 17/23` shi.
- The weight of 1 bundle of Yi (乙禾) is `b = 11/23` shi.
- The weight of 1 bundle of Bing (丙禾) is `c = 10/23` shi.

This solution follows the ancient Chinese "fangcheng" method by systematically eliminating variables and solving for the weights.
