今有邑方十里，各中開門。甲乙俱從邑中央而出。乙東出；甲南出，出門不知步數，邪向東北磨邑，適與乙會。率甲行五，乙行三。問︰甲、乙行各幾何？
術曰：令五自乘，三亦自乘，并而半之，為邪行率。邪行率減於五自乘者，餘，為南行率。以三乘五，為乙東行率。置邑方半之，以南行率乘之，如東行率而一，即得出南門步數。以增邑方半，即南行。置南行步求弦者，以邪行率乘之，求東者以東行率乘之，各自為實。實如南行率得一步。
荅曰：甲出南門 a(=800)步 ，邪東北行 b(=9775/2)步 ，及乙。乙東行 c(=8625/2)步 。

Suppose there is a square city 10 li on each side, with gates at the middle of each side.
Person A and Person B both start from the center of the city and leave through different gates.
Person B exits through the east gate, while Person A exits through the south gate.
The number of steps they take to exit the gates is unknown.
Person A then walks diagonally northeast along the city's edge and meets Person B.
The walking rates are such that Person A walks 5 steps for every 3 steps Person B walks.
Question: how far does each person walk?

The procedure says:
- Let 5 multiply itself, and let 3 multiply itself. Add these and halve the result to get the diagonal walking rate.
- Subtract the diagonal walking rate from 5 multiplied by itself. The remainder is the south walking rate.
- Multiply 3 by 5 to get the east walking rate.
- Take half of the city's side length and multiply it by the south walking rate. Divide the result by the east walking rate to get the number of steps Person A takes to exit the south gate.
- Add this to half of the city's side length to get the total southward distance walked by Person A.
- To find the diagonal distance walked by Person A, multiply the southward distance by the diagonal walking rate.
- To find the eastward distance walked by Person B, multiply the southward distance by the east walking rate.
- Divide each result by the south walking rate to get the respective distances.

Answer: Person A exits the south gate and walks *a*(=800) steps south, then walks diagonally northeast *b*(=9775/2) steps to meet Person B. Person B walks *c*(=8625/2) steps east.
