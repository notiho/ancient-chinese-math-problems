今有粟一十二萬八千九百四十斛九斗三合，出與人買絹一匹，直粟三斛五斗七升。問：絹幾何？
術曰：置粟一十二萬八千九百四十斛九斗三合為實，以三斛五斗七升為法，除之，得匹餘四十之所得，又以法除之，即得。
答曰： a(=361179/10)匹 。

Suppose there are 128,940 hu, 9 dou, and 3 sheng of millet. It is used to buy silk, where 1 bolt of silk costs 3 hu, 5 dou, and 7 sheng of millet.
Question: how many bolts of silk can be obtained?

The procedure says: Place 128,940 hu, 9 dou, and 3 sheng of millet as the dividend.
Take 3 hu, 5 dou, and 7 sheng as the divisor.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to obtain the number of bolts and the remainder.
Take the remainder and divide it again by the divisor to obtain the fractional part.

Answer: *a*(=361179/10) bolts of silk.
