今有賣牛二、羊五，以買十三豕，有餘錢一千。賣牛三、豕三，以買九羊，錢適足。賣羊六、豕八，以買五牛，錢不足六百。問︰牛、羊、豕價各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置牛二、羊五正，豕一十三負，餘錢數正；次牛三正，羊九負，豕三正；次牛五負，羊六正，豕八正，不足錢負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：牛價 a(=1200) ，羊價 b(=500) ，豕價 c(=300) 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese method of solving simultaneous linear equations (方程術) into Python code. The problem involves three equations with three unknowns: the prices of a cow (牛), a sheep (羊), and a pig (豕). The equations are derived from the problem statement.

### Problem Setup:
1. Selling 2 cows and 5 sheep to buy 13 pigs leaves 1000 cash remaining:
   \( 2x + 5y - 13z = 1000 \)
2. Selling 3 cows and 3 pigs to buy 9 sheep uses exactly all the money:
   \( 3x - 9y + 3z = 0 \)
3. Selling 6 sheep and 8 pigs to buy 5 cows leaves a deficit of 600:
   \( -5x + 6y + 8z = -600 \)

Here, \( x \) is the price of a cow, \( y \) is the price of a sheep, and \( z \) is the price of a pig.

We will solve these equations using the ancient Chinese method of elimination (正負術 and 方程術).

x = Fraction(eq1[3] - eq1[2] * z - eq1[1] * y, eq1[0])

# Results

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Step 1:** Eliminate \( x \) from the second and third equations using the first equation. This is done by multiplying the equations by appropriate factors and then subtracting or adding them.
2. **Step 2:** Eliminate \( y \) from the resulting equations using the same method.
3. **Step 3:** Solve for \( z \) (price of a pig) from the final equation.
4. **Step 4:** Substitute \( z \) back into one of the reduced equations to solve for \( y \) (price of a sheep).
5. **Step 5:** Substitute \( y \) and \( z \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( x \) (price of a cow).

### Final Answer:
- Price of a cow (\( a \)): 1200
- Price of a sheep (\( b \)): 500
- Price of a pig (\( c \)): 300
