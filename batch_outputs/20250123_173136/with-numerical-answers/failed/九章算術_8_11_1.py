今有武馬一匹，中馬二匹，下馬三匹，皆載四十石至阪，皆不能上。武馬借中馬一匹，中馬借下馬一匹，下馬借武馬一匹，乃皆上。問︰武、中、下馬一匹各力引幾何？
術曰：如方程各置所借，以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：武馬一匹力引 a(=160/7)石 ，中馬一匹力引 b(=120/7)石 ，下馬一匹力引 c(=40/7)石 。

Suppose there are three types of horses: one Wu horse, two Zhong horses, and three Xia horses. Each is tasked with carrying 40 shi up a slope but cannot do so alone. 
The Wu horse borrows one Zhong horse, the Zhong horse borrows one Xia horse, and the Xia horse borrows one Wu horse, and then they can all ascend the slope.
Question: How much pulling power does each Wu, Zhong, and Xia horse have individually?

The procedure says: Use the method of equations, placing the borrowed amounts into the equations with positive and negative signs.

The method of equations says: Place the coefficients of the Wu, Zhong, and Xia horses in the equations. 
For the right-hand side, set the total load (39 dou). 
For the left-hand side, arrange the coefficients of the horses as per the borrowing relationships. 
Use elimination by multiplying rows and dividing directly to simplify the equations. 
Finally, solve for each variable (Wu, Zhong, Xia) step by step.

Answer: The pulling power of one Wu horse is *a*(=160/7) shi, one Zhong horse is *b*(=120/7) shi, and one Xia horse is *c*(=40/7) shi.
