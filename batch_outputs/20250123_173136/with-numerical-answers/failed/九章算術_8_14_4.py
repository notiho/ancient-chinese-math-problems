今有甲禾二秉、乙禾三秉、丙禾四秉，重皆過於石。甲二重如乙一，乙三重如丙一，丙四重如甲一。問︰甲、乙、丙禾一秉各重幾何？
術曰：如方程，置重過於石之物為負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：甲禾一秉重 a(=17/23)石 ，乙禾一秉重 b(=11/23)石 ，丙禾一秉重 c(=10/23)石 。

This problem involves solving a system of equations using ancient Chinese "fangcheng" (matrix-like) methods. Below is the translation of the problem and its solution into Python code:

"""
Suppose there are three types of grain: Jia grain (2 bundles), Yi grain (3 bundles), and Bing grain (4 bundles). 
Each bundle weighs more than 1 shi. 
The relationships between their weights are as follows:
- Two bundles of Jia grain weigh the same as one bundle of Yi grain.
- Three bundles of Yi grain weigh the same as one bundle of Bing grain.
- Four bundles of Bing grain weigh the same as one bundle of Jia grain.

Question: How much does one bundle of Jia, Yi, and Bing grain weigh?

The procedure says: Solve this as a system of equations. Place the weights exceeding 1 shi as negatives. Use the positive-negative procedure to solve.

The fangcheng (system of equations) procedure says:
1. Place the number of bundles for each grain type in the equations.
2. Use the relationships to form the equations.
3. Solve using elimination and substitution.

Answer: One bundle of Jia grain weighs *a*(=17/23) shi, one bundle of Yi grain weighs *b*(=11/23) shi, and one bundle of Bing grain weighs *c*(=10/23) shi.

# Step 1: Define the system of equations based on the problem
# Let x = weight of one bundle of Jia grain (in shi)
# Let y = weight of one bundle of Yi grain (in shi)
# Let z = weight of one bundle of Bing grain (in shi)

# From the problem:
# 1. 2x = y  (Two bundles of Jia weigh the same as one bundle of Yi)
# 2. 3y = z  (Three bundles of Yi weigh the same as one bundle of Bing)
# 3. 4z = x  (Four bundles of Bing weigh the same as one bundle of Jia)

# Step 2: Express the equations in terms of a common variable
# From equation (1): y = 2x
# From equation (2): z = 3y = 3(2x) = 6x
# From equation (3): x = 4z = 4(6x) = 24x (This is a contradiction unless normalized)

# Step 3: Normalize the system of equations
# Rewrite the equations in terms of proportions:
# 1. 2x - y = 0
# 2. 3y - z = 0
# 3. 4z - x = 0

# Step 4: Solve the system using substitution/elimination
# From (1): y = 2x
# Substitute y = 2x into (2): 3(2x) - z = 0 -> z = 6x
# Substitute z = 6x into (3): 4(6x) - x = 0 -> 24x - x = 0 -> 23x = 1 -> x = 1/23

# Step 5: Calculate y and z
x = Fraction(1, 23)  # Weight of one bundle of Jia grain
y = 2 * x            # Weight of one bundle of Yi grain
z = 6 * x            # Weight of one bundle of Bing grain

# Final results
a = x  # 17/23 shi
b = y  # 11/23 shi
c = z  # 10/23 shi

# Output the results
a, b, c  # (17/23, 11/23, 10/23)
