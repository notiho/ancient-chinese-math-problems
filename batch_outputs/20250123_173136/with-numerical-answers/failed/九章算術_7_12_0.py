今有醇酒一斗，直錢五十；行酒一斗，直錢一十。今將錢三十，得酒二斗。問︰醇、行酒各得幾何？
術曰：假令醇酒五升，行酒一斗五升，有餘一十。令之醇酒二升，行酒一斗八升，不足二。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰：醇酒 a(=5/2)升 ，行酒 b(=7/4)斗 。

Suppose there is pure wine (醇酒) worth 50 qian per dou, and diluted wine (行酒) worth 10 qian per dou.
Now, with 30 qian, one can obtain 2 dou of wine.
Question: how much pure wine and diluted wine does one obtain?

The procedure says: Suppose there are 5 sheng of pure wine and 1 dou 5 sheng of diluted wine, leaving an excess of 10 qian.
Suppose there are 2 sheng of pure wine and 1 dou 8 sheng of diluted wine, falling short by 2 qian.

The procedure for surplus and deficit (盈不足術) says: Place the rates of the goods, with the surplus and deficit below them respectively.
Multiply the rates by the surplus and deficit, and sum them to obtain the dividend.
Sum the surplus and deficit to obtain the divisor.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to obtain the result.
If there are fractions, simplify them.
For the surplus and deficit corresponding to the same goods, place the rates, subtract the smaller from the larger, and simplify the dividend and divisor.
The dividend represents the price of the goods, and the divisor represents the quantity of people.

Answer: *a*(=5/2) dou of pure wine, and *b*(=7/4) dou of diluted wine.
