今有上禾三秉，益實六斗，當下禾十秉。下禾五秉，益實一斗，當上禾二秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾三秉正，下禾一十秉負，益實六斗負。次置上禾二秉負，下禾五秉正，益實一斗負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a(=8)斗 ，下禾一秉實 b(=3)斗 。

Suppose there are 3 bundles of upper millet, which add 6 dou of grain, equivalent to 10 bundles of lower millet.
And 5 bundles of lower millet, which add 1 dou of grain, equivalent to 2 bundles of upper millet.
Question: how much grain does one bundle of upper millet and one bundle of lower millet yield?

The procedure says: Treat it as a system of equations.
Place 3 bundles of upper millet as positive, 10 bundles of lower millet as negative, and 6 dou of grain as negative.
Next, place 2 bundles of upper millet as negative, 5 bundles of lower millet as positive, and 1 dou of grain as negative.
Use the positive-negative procedure to solve.

The procedure for solving systems of equations says:
Place 3 bundles of upper millet, 2 bundles of middle millet, and 1 bundle of lower millet, with 39 dou of grain on the right side.
Arrange the middle and left millet similarly to the right side.
Multiply the upper millet row by the middle row and divide directly.
Then multiply by the next row and divide directly.
For the middle row, multiply the middle millet row by the left row and divide directly.
For the left row, if the lower millet is not exact, take the upper as the divisor and the lower as the dividend.
The result is the grain yield of the lower millet.
To find the middle millet, multiply the middle row by the lower result and divide by the lower millet's grain yield.
The remainder, divided by the middle millet's bundle count plus one, is the middle millet's grain yield.
To find the upper millet, multiply the right row by the lower result and divide by the lower and middle millet's grain yields.
The remainder, divided by the upper millet's bundle count plus one, is the upper millet's grain yield.
The grain yields are determined according to the procedure.

Answer: One bundle of upper millet yields *a*(=8) dou, and one bundle of lower millet yields *b*(=3) dou.
