This problem is quite complex and involves advanced ancient Chinese mathematical procedures for solving cubic equations. The problem describes a situation where two types of granaries (square and circular) are to be constructed, with specific geometric relationships between their dimensions. The solution involves calculating the dimensions of the granaries such that they hold a specified amount of grain.

Let's break this down step by step and translate the procedure into Python code:

---

### Problem:
There are 5140 shi of grain. Two granaries are to be constructed: one square and one circular. The granaries are designed such that:
1. The square granary has a square base, and the circular granary has a circular base.
2. The side length of the square base is equal to the diameter of the circular base.
3. The depth of both granaries is the same.
4. The depth is 7 chi less than the bottom side length (or diameter) and 14 chi more than the top side length (or diameter).
5. Both granaries are filled to capacity, and the total volume equals the given amount of grain.

The task is to find the dimensions of the granaries: the top side length (or diameter), the bottom side length (or diameter), and the depth.

---

### Procedure:
1. Multiply the grain volume by 42 and divide by 75 to calculate the "square pavilion volume."
2. Let the difference between the top and bottom dimensions be the "difference" (`差`).
3. Square the difference and divide by 3 to calculate the "corner excess" (`隅陽冪`).
4. Multiply the corner excess by the depth difference and subtract it from the volume to get the "remainder" (`實`).
5. Multiply the depth difference by the difference and add the corner excess to get the "method for the square" (`方法`).
6. Add the difference to the depth difference to get the "method for the edge" (`廉法`).
7. Solve the cubic equation to find the top side length (or diameter).
8. Add the difference to the top side length to get the bottom side length.
9. Use the relationships to calculate the depth.
