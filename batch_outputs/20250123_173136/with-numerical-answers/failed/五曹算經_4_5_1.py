今有方窖從一丈三尺廣六尺深一丈。問：受粟㡬何？
術曰：列從一丈三尺以廣六尺乘之得七十八尺以深一丈乘之得七百八十尺以斛法除之即得。
答曰： a(=2407/5)斛 奇 b(=39/5)寸 。

Suppose there is a square pit with a length of 1 zhang and 3 chi, a width of 6 chi, and a depth of 1 zhang.
Question: how much millet can it hold?

The procedure says: Multiply the length (1 zhang 3 chi) by the width (6 chi), obtaining 78 chi².
Then multiply this by the depth (1 zhang), obtaining 780 chi³.
Divide this by the hu divisor to obtain the result.

Answer: *a*(=2407/5) hu and *b*(=39/5) cun.
