今有上禾三秉，益實六斗，當下禾十秉。下禾五秉，益實一斗，當上禾二秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾三秉正，下禾一十秉負，益實六斗負。次置上禾二秉負，下禾五秉正，益實一斗負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a(=8)斗 ，下禾一秉實 b(=3)斗 。

Suppose there are 3 bundles of superior grain, which when increased by 6 dou of grain, are equivalent to 10 bundles of inferior grain.
Additionally, 5 bundles of inferior grain, when increased by 1 dou of grain, are equivalent to 2 bundles of superior grain.
Question: how much grain does one bundle of superior grain and one bundle of inferior grain contain respectively?

The procedure says: Treat it as a system of linear equations.
Place 3 bundles of superior grain as positive, 10 bundles of inferior grain as negative, and 6 dou of grain as negative.
Next, place 2 bundles of superior grain as negative, 5 bundles of inferior grain as positive, and 1 dou of grain as negative.
Use the method of positive and negative operations to solve.

The method for solving systems of equations says: Place the coefficients of superior grain, intermediate grain, and inferior grain, along with the total grain (39 dou), on the right side.
Arrange the coefficients of the middle and left grains similarly to the right side.
Multiply the first row by the coefficient of superior grain in the second row, and divide by the diagonal coefficient.
Repeat for subsequent rows.
For the middle grain, multiply the middle row by the coefficient of the left row and divide by the diagonal coefficient.
For the inferior grain, the upper coefficient becomes the divisor, and the lower coefficient becomes the dividend.
The dividend is the amount of grain for the inferior grain.
To find the middle grain, multiply the divisor by the middle row's coefficient and divide by the inferior grain's coefficient.
The remainder, divided by the middle grain's coefficient, gives the amount of grain for the middle grain.
To find the superior grain, multiply the divisor by the right row's coefficient and divide by the inferior and middle grain's coefficients.
The remainder, divided by the superior grain's coefficient, gives the amount of grain for the superior grain.
The results are as follows.

Answer: One bundle of superior grain contains *a*(=8) dou, and one bundle of inferior grain contains *b*(=3) dou.
