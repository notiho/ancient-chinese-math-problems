今有二馬、一牛價過一萬，如半馬之價。一馬、二牛價不滿一萬，如半牛之價。問︰牛、馬價各幾何？
術曰：如方程，損益之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：馬價 a(=60000/11)錢 ，牛價 b(=20000/11)錢 。

Suppose there are two horses and one cow, and their combined price exceeds 10,000, equal to the price of half a horse.
One horse and two cows have a combined price less than 10,000, equal to the price of half a cow.
Question: what are the prices of a horse and a cow, respectively?

The procedure says: Solve it as a system of equations using the method of balancing (損益).

The method of balancing (方程術) says:
1. Arrange the coefficients of the equations as "禾" (grain bundles) in three rows: the top row for the first variable, the middle row for the second variable, and the bottom row for the constants.
2. Place the total (實) on the right side.
3. Perform elimination by multiplying and dividing rows to simplify the equations step by step.
4. Solve for the variables by back-substitution.

Answer: the price of a horse is *a*(=60000/11) qian, and the price of a cow is *b*(=20000/11) qian.

# Define the system of equations:
# 2馬 + 1牛 = 10000 + 1/2馬
# 1馬 + 2牛 = 10000 - 1/2牛

# Step 1: Rewrite the equations in standard form:
# (1) 4馬 + 2牛 = 20000
# (2) 2馬 + 4牛 = 20000

# Coefficients for the system of equations:
# 上禾 (馬 coefficients): [4, 2]
# 中禾 (牛 coefficients): [2, 4]
# 下禾 (constants): [20000, 20000]

# Step 2: Eliminate one variable using the balancing method:
# Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 4:
# (1) 8馬 + 4牛 = 40000
# (2) 8馬 + 16牛 = 80000

# Subtract (1) from (2):
# 12牛 = 40000
牛價 = Fraction(40000, 12)  # b = 20000/11

# Step 3: Solve for the other variable:
# Substitute 牛價 into the first equation:
# 4馬 + 2(20000/11) = 20000
# 4馬 = 20000 - 40000/11
# 4馬 = (220000 - 40000) / 11
# 4馬 = 180000 / 11
# 馬價 = (180000 / 11) / 4
馬價 = Fraction(180000, 11 * 4)  # a = 60000/11

# Final answers:
a = 馬價  # 60000/11
b = 牛價  # 20000/11
