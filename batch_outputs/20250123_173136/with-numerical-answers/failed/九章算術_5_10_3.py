今有穿渠上廣一丈八尺，下廣三尺六寸，深一丈八尺，袤五萬一千八百二十四尺。問︰積幾何？
荅曰：一千七萬四千五百八十五尺六寸。
秋程人功三百尺，問︰用徒幾何？
術曰：以一人功尺數，乘先到人數為實。并渠上下廣而半之，以深乘之為法。實如法得袤尺。
荅曰： a(=33582)人 功。內少 b(=72/5)尺 。

Suppose there is a canal with an upper width of 1 zhang 8 chi, a lower width of 3 chi 6 cun, a depth of 1 zhang 8 chi, and a length of 51824 chi.
Question 1: What is the total volume?
Answer: 174585 chi 6 cun.

Question 2: If one person can dig 300 chi of volume, how many workers are required?
The procedure says: Multiply the number of chi one person can dig by the number of workers already present to obtain the dividend.
Add the upper and lower widths of the canal and halve it, then multiply by the depth to obtain the divisor.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to obtain the number of chi of length.

Answer: *a*(=33582) workers are required, with *b*(=72/5) chi remaining.
