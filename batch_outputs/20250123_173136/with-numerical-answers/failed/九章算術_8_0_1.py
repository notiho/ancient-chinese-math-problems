今有上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗；上禾二秉，中禾三秉，下禾一秉，實三十四斗；上禾一秉，中禾二秉，下禾三秉，實二十六斗。問︰上、中、下禾實一秉各幾何？
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉， a(=37/4)斗 ，中禾一秉， b(=17/4)斗 ，下禾一秉， c(=11/4)斗 。

Suppose there are 3 bundles of upper-grade grain, 2 bundles of middle-grade grain, and 1 bundle of lower-grade grain, yielding 39 dou.
There are 2 bundles of upper-grade grain, 3 bundles of middle-grade grain, and 1 bundle of lower-grade grain, yielding 34 dou.
There is 1 bundle of upper-grade grain, 2 bundles of middle-grade grain, and 3 bundles of lower-grade grain, yielding 26 dou.
Question: how much does one bundle of upper-grade, middle-grade, and lower-grade grain yield respectively?

The procedure for solving systems of linear equations says:
Place the first equation (3 bundles of upper-grade grain, 2 bundles of middle-grade grain, 1 bundle of lower-grade grain, yielding 39 dou) on the right side.
Arrange the second and third equations similarly.
Multiply the upper-grade grain coefficient in the second equation by the first equation, and divide directly.
Repeat for the third equation.
Then, for the middle-grade grain, multiply the middle-grade coefficient in the third equation by the second equation, and divide directly.
For the lower-grade grain, use the remaining coefficients to calculate.
Finally, divide by the respective coefficients to find the yield per bundle.

Answer: One bundle of upper-grade grain yields *a*(=37/4) dou, one bundle of middle-grade grain yields *b*(=17/4) dou, and one bundle of lower-grade grain yields *c*(=11/4) dou.
