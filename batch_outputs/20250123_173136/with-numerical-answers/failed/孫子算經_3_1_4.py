Suppose there are 15,000,000 adult males (丁), and 400,000 soldiers are to be conscripted.
Question: how many adult males are required to provide one soldier?

The procedure says: Place the 15,000,000 adult males as the dividend.
Take the 400,000 soldiers as the divisor.
Divide the dividend by the divisor, and the result is obtained.

Answer: *a*(=37) adult males and *b*(=5) parts.

# 置丁一千五百萬為實

a = result.numerator // result.denominator  # 37 (whole part)
b = result.numerator % result.denominator   # 5 (remainder as parts of the denominator)
b = Fraction(b, result.denominator)         # Represent remainder as a fraction

# Final result:
