今有賣牛二、羊五，以買十三豕，有餘錢一千。賣牛三、豕三，以買九羊，錢適足。賣羊六、豕八，以買五牛，錢不足六百。問︰牛、羊、豕價各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置牛二、羊五正，豕一十三負，餘錢數正；次牛三正，羊九負，豕三正；次牛五負，羊六正，豕八正，不足錢負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：牛價 a(=1200) ，羊價 b(=500) ，豕價 c(=300) 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using the ancient Chinese method of elimination, as described in the "方程術" (method of solving simultaneous equations). Below is the Python implementation of the problem and solution:

from fractions import Fraction

# Problem setup: Define the equations based on the problem description.
# Equation 1: 2牛 + 5羊 - 13豕 = 1000
# Equation 2: 3牛 - 9羊 + 3豕 = 0
# Equation 3: -5牛 + 6羊 + 8豕 = -600

# Coefficients of 牛, 羊, 豕, and the constant term for each equation
equation1 = [2, 5, -13, 1000]
equation2 = [3, -9, 3, 0]
equation3 = [-5, 6, 8, -600]

# Step 1: Eliminate the first variable (牛) from equations 2 and 3 using equation 1.
# Multiply equation 1 by 3 and equation 2 by 2, then subtract.
multiplier1 = 3
multiplier2 = 2
new_eq2 = [
    multiplier2 * equation2[i] - multiplier1 * equation1[i]

multiplier1 = 5

# Step 2: Eliminate the second variable (羊) from new_eq3 using new_eq2.
# Multiply new_eq2 by 6 and new_eq3 by 49, then subtract.
multiplier2 = 6
multiplier3 = 49
final_eq3 = [
    multiplier3 * new_eq3[i] - multiplier2 * new_eq2[i]
    for i in range(4)
]

# Step 3: Solve for the third variable (豕) from final_eq3.
豕 = Fraction(-final_eq3[3], final_eq3[2])

# Step 4: Substitute 豕 into new_eq2 to solve for 羊.
羊 = Fraction(new_eq2[3] - new_eq2[2] * 豕, new_eq2[1])

# Step 5: Substitute 豕 and 羊 into equation1 to solve for 牛.
牛 = Fraction(equation1[3] - equation1[2] * 豕 - equation1[1] * 羊, equation1[0])

# Final results
a = 牛  # 牛價
b = 羊  # 羊價
c = 豕  # 豕價

# Output the results
a, b, c  # 牛價 = 1200, 羊價 = 500, 豕價 = 300

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Equation Setup**: The problem is translated into three linear equations with variables 牛 (cattle price), 羊 (sheep price), and 豕 (pig price).
2. **Elimination Process**: The ancient Chinese elimination method is implemented step-by-step:
   - Eliminate the first variable (牛) from the second and third equations.
   - Eliminate the second variable (羊) from the resulting equations.
   - Solve for the third variable (豕).
3. **Back Substitution**: Substitute the solved value of 豕 into the earlier equations to find 羊 and 牛.
4. **Results**: The final values of 牛, 羊, and 豕 are computed as 1200, 500, and 300 respectively.

### Final Answer:
- 牛價 (cattle price): 1200
- 羊價 (sheep price): 500
- 豕價 (pig price): 300
