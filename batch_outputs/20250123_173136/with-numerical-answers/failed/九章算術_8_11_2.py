今有武馬一匹，中馬二匹，下馬三匹，皆載四十石至阪，皆不能上。武馬借中馬一匹，中馬借下馬一匹，下馬借武馬一匹，乃皆上。問︰武、中、下馬一匹各力引幾何？
術曰：如方程各置所借，以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：武馬一匹力引 a(=160/7)石 ，中馬一匹力引 b(=120/7)石 ，下馬一匹力引 c(=40/7)石 。

Suppose there is one Wu horse, two Zhong horses, and three Xia horses. Each is tasked with carrying 40 shi up a slope, but none can make it.
The Wu horse borrows one Zhong horse, the Zhong horse borrows one Xia horse, and the Xia horse borrows one Wu horse. Then, all are able to ascend.
Question: how much pulling force does one Wu horse, one Zhong horse, and one Xia horse exert respectively?

The procedure says: Treat this as a system of equations, placing the borrowed amounts into the equations with positive and negative signs.

The procedure for solving systems of equations says: Place the coefficients of the unknowns (Wu, Zhong, Xia horses) in rows, along with the total load (39 dou) on the right-hand side.
Perform elimination by multiplying rows and dividing by the pivot element, reducing the system step by step.
Finally, back-substitute to solve for each unknown.

Answer: The pulling force of one Wu horse is *a*(=160/7) shi, one Zhong horse is *b*(=120/7) shi, and one Xia horse is *c*(=40/7) shi.

# Define the system of equations based on the problem:
# Let x = Wu horse's pulling force, y = Zhong horse's pulling force, z = Xia horse's pulling force.
# The equations are:
# 1. x + y = 40
# 2. y + z = 40
# 3. z + x = 40

# Coefficients of the equations:
# Row 1: Wu (x), Zhong (y), Xia (z), Total
row1 = [1, 1, 0, 40]  # x + y = 40
row2 = [0, 1, 1, 40]  # y + z = 40
row3 = [1, 0, 1, 40]  # z + x = 40

# Elimination process:
# Step 1: Eliminate x from row2 and row3 using row1.
factor_row2 = Fraction(row2[0], row1[0])  # Factor to eliminate x from row2
row2 = [row2[i] - factor_row2 * row1[i] for i in range(4)]  # New row2

factor_row3 = Fraction(row3[0], row1[0])  # Factor to eliminate x from row3
row3 = [row3[i] - factor_row3 * row1[i] for i in range(4)]  # New row3

# Step 2: Eliminate y from row3 using row2.
factor_row3 = Fraction(row3[1], row2[1])  # Factor to eliminate y from row3
row3 = [row3[i] - factor_row3 * row2[i] for i in range(4)]  # New row3

y = Fraction(row2[3] - row2[2] * z, row2[1])  # Solve for y
x = Fraction(row1[3] - row1[1] * y, row1[0])  # Solve for x

a = x  # Wu horse's pulling force
b = y  # Zhong horse's pulling force
