假令有粟五千一百四十石，欲作方窖、圓窖各一，令口小底大，方面於圓徑等，兩深亦同，其深少於下方七尺，多於上方一丈四尺，盛各滿中而粟適盡。問：方、徑、深各多少？
術曰：以四十二乘斛法，以乘粟，七十五而一，為方亭積。令方差自乘，三而一，為隅陽冪，以截多乘之，減積，余為實。以多乘差，加冪，為方法。多加差，為廉法，從。開立方除之，即上方。加差，即合所問。
答曰：上方徑各 a(=7)尺 ，下方徑各 b(=14/5)丈 ，深各 c(=21/10)丈 。

This problem is quite complex and involves advanced ancient Chinese mathematical techniques for solving cubic equations. I will carefully translate the procedure into Python code step by step, ensuring that the structure of the procedure is followed.

### Problem Description:
We have 5140 shi of millet, and we want to construct a square pit and a circular pit, both with smaller openings at the top and larger bases at the bottom. The square side length at the top is equal to the diameter of the circular pit at the top. The depths of both pits are the same, and the depth is 7 chi less than the bottom side length of the square pit and 1 zhang 4 chi more than the top side length of the square pit. Both pits are filled to capacity, and the millet is exactly used up.

We are tasked to find:
- The top side length (or diameter) of the pits (`a`),
- The bottom side length (or diameter) of the pits (`b`),
- The depth of the pits (`c`).

---

### Procedure:
The procedure involves solving a cubic equation derived from the geometry of the pits and the volume of millet. Let's translate this into Python step by step.
