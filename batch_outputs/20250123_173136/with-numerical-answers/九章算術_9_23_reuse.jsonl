From the top of the pole, one observes the water's edge, and the line of sight enters the well's diameter by 4 cun.\nQuestion: how deep is the well?\n\nThe procedure says: Place the well's diameter, 5 chi, and subtract the 4 cun of entry into the diameter. The remainder is multiplied by the upright pole's 5 chi, giving the dividend. Use the 4 cun of entry as the divisor.
