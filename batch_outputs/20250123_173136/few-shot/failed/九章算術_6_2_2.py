今有均賦粟：甲縣二萬五百二十戶，粟一斛二十錢，自輸其縣；乙縣一萬二千三百一十二戶，粟一斛一十錢，至輸所二百里；丙縣七千一百八十二戶，粟一斛一十二錢，至輸所一百五十里；丁縣一萬三千三百三十八戶，粟一斛一十七錢，至輸所二百五十里；戊縣五千一百三十戶，粟一斛一十三錢，至輸所一百五十里。凡五縣賦，輸粟一萬斛。一車載二十五斛，與僦一里一錢。欲以縣戶輸粟，令費勞等。問︰縣各粟幾何？
術曰：以一里僦價，乘至輸所里，以一車二十五斛除之，加一斛粟價，則致一斛之費。各以約其戶數，為衰。甲衰一千二十六，乙衰六百八十四，丙衰三百九十九，丁衰四百九十四，戊衰二百七十，副并為法。所賦粟乘未并者，各自為實。實如法得一。
荅曰：甲縣 a斛 。乙縣 b斛 。丙縣 c斛 。丁縣 d斛 。戊縣 e斛 。

Suppose there are five counties tasked with contributing millet, with the following details:

- County A: 20,520 households, millet cost 1 hu 20 qian, transported within the county.
- County B: 12,312 households, millet cost 1 hu 10 qian, transported 200 li to the delivery site.
- County C: 7,182 households, millet cost 1 hu 12 qian, transported 150 li to the delivery site.
- County D: 13,338 households, millet cost 1 hu 17 qian, transported 250 li to the delivery site.
- County E: 5,130 households, millet cost 1 hu 13 qian, transported 150 li to the delivery site.

In total, the five counties must contribute 10,000 hu of millet. One cart carries 25 hu, and the transport cost is 1 qian per li. The millet should be distributed among the counties such that the labor and cost are equalized.

The procedure says:
- Multiply the transport cost per li by the distance to the delivery site.
- Divide by the amount carried by one cart (25 hu), then add the cost of 1 hu of millet. This gives the cost of delivering 1 hu of millet.
- Multiply this cost by the number of households in each county to calculate the "weight" (衰) for each county.
- The weights for the counties are: A = 1026, B = 684, C = 399, D = 494, E = 270.
- Add these weights together to form the divisor (法).
- Multiply the total millet to be delivered by the weights of each county to calculate the dividend (實) for each county.
- Divide the dividend by the divisor to obtain the amount of millet each county should contribute.

The answer says: County A contributes *a* hu, County B contributes *b* hu, County C contributes *c* hu, County D contributes *d* hu, and County E contributes *e* hu.
