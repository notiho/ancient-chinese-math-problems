今有漆三得油四，油四和漆五。今有漆三斗，欲令分以易油，還自和餘漆。問︰出漆、得油、和漆各幾何？
術曰：假令出漆九升，不足六升。令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰：出漆 a斗 ，得油 b斗 ，和漆 c斗 ， d升 。

This problem involves a proportional exchange of lacquer and oil, followed by mixing the remaining lacquer with the obtained oil. Let's translate the procedure into Python step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Ratios**:
   - 3 dou of lacquer yields 4 dou of oil.
   - 4 dou of oil mixes with 5 dou of lacquer.

2. **Task**:
   - Start with 3 dou of lacquer.
   - Exchange lacquer for oil.
   - Mix the obtained oil with the remaining lacquer.
   - Determine:
     - How much lacquer is exchanged (`出漆`).
     - How much oil is obtained (`得油`).
     - How much lacquer and oil are mixed together (`和漆`).

3. **Procedure**:
   - Use the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method) to calculate the exchange and mixing.

### Python Code Implementation:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 漆三得油四 (3 dou of lacquer yields 4 dou of oil)
漆_to_油_ratio = Fraction(4, 3)

# 油四和漆五 (4 dou of oil mixes with 5 dou of lacquer)
油_to_漆_ratio = Fraction(5, 4)

# 今有漆三斗 (Start with 3 dou of lacquer)
initial_漆 = 3

# Step 1: Calculate how much lacquer is exchanged (出漆)
# 假令出漆九升，不足六升 (Assume 9 sheng is exchanged, leaving a deficit of 6 sheng)
# 漆 is exchanged in dou, so convert assumptions to dou:
假出漆_盈 = Fraction(9, 10)  # 9 sheng = 9/10 dou
假出漆_不足 = Fraction(6, 10)  # 6 sheng = 6/10 dou

# 盈不足術:
# 置所出率，盈、不足各居其下 (Place the exchange rate, with excess and deficit below)
所出率 = 漆_to_油_ratio  # 4/3

# 令維乘所出率，并以為實 (Multiply the exchange rate by the excess and deficit, then sum them)
實 = 假出漆_盈 * 所出率 + 假出漆_不足 * 所出率

# 并盈、不足為法 (Sum the excess and deficit to form the divisor)
法 = 假出漆_盈 + 假出漆_不足

# 實如法而一 (Divide the total by the divisor to find the true exchange amount)
出漆 = Fraction(實, 法)

# Step 2: Calculate how much oil is obtained (得油)
得油 = 出漆 * 漆_to_油_ratio

# Step 3: Calculate how much lacquer and oil are mixed (和漆)
# Remaining lacquer after exchange:
剩餘漆 = initial_漆 - 出漆

# 和漆 = 得油 + 剩餘漆
和漆 = 得油 + 剩餘漆

# Convert 和漆 to dou and sheng (1 dou = 10 sheng)
和漆_dou = int(和漆)  # Whole dou
和漆_sheng = int((和漆 - 和漆_dou) * 10)  # Remaining sheng

# Final Results:
a = 出漆  # 出漆 in dou
b = 得油  # 得油 in dou
c = 和漆_dou  # 和漆 in dou
d = 和漆_sheng  # 和漆 in sheng

# Output the results
a, b, c, d

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Ratios**:
   - The given ratios are converted into fractions for precise calculations.
   - `漆_to_油_ratio` represents the exchange rate of lacquer to oil.
   - `油_to_漆_ratio` represents the mixing ratio of oil to lacquer.

2. **Excess and Deficiency Method**:
   - Assumptions (`假出漆_盈` and `假出漆_不足`) are used to calculate the true amount of lacquer exchanged (`出漆`).
   - The method involves calculating the total "實" (numerator) and "法" (denominator) to determine the true value.

3. **Mixing**:
   - The remaining lacquer after exchange is added to the obtained oil to calculate the total mixed amount (`和漆`).
   - The result is split into dou and sheng for the final answer.

### Final Answer:
- 出漆: `a` dou
- 得油: `b` dou
- 和漆: `c` dou and `d` sheng
