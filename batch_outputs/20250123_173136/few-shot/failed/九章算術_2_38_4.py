今有出錢一千一百二十，買絲一石二鈞十八斤。欲其貴賤斤率之，問︰各幾何？
其率術曰：各置所買石、鈞、斤、兩以為法，以所率乘錢數為實，實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法賤實貴。
荅曰：其 a鈞 ，斤 b錢 。其 c石 ，斤 d錢 。

This problem involves calculating the price per unit weight of silk based on the total cost and the total weight purchased. Here's the solution:

"""
Suppose there is an expenditure of 1120 qian to purchase 1 shi, 2 jun, and 18 jin of silk.
It is desired to calculate the price per jin for each unit (shi, jun, jin).
Question: what is the price per jin for each?

The procedure says: Place the amounts of shi, jun, jin, and liang as the divisor.
Multiply the total money by the respective rates to obtain the dividend.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to obtain the price per jin.
If the dividend is less than the divisor, subtract the dividend from the divisor. The divisor represents the cheaper rate, and the dividend represents the more expensive rate.

Answer: the price per jin for 1 jun is *a* qian, *b* qian per jin. The price per jin for 1 shi is *c* qian, *d* qian per jin.
