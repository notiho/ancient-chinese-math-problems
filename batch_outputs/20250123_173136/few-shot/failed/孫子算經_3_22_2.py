今有方物一束外周，一市有三十二枚。問：積幾何？
術曰：重置二位左位減八餘加右位，至盡虛加一，即得。
答曰： a枚 。

The problem and procedure provided are somewhat unclear in their mathematical structure, and the exact meaning of the steps is ambiguous without additional context. However, I will attempt to interpret and encode the procedure as faithfully as possible based on the description.

"""
Suppose there is a bundle of square objects, with an outer perimeter of one bundle. Each market unit contains 32 items.
Question: what is the total number of items?

The procedure says: Place the weight in two positions. Subtract 8 from the left position, add the remainder to the right position, and continue until the remainder is zero. Add 1 to the result, and this is the answer.

Answer: *a* items.
"""

# Initial values
外周 = 1  # Outer perimeter (interpreted as 1 bundle)
每市 = 32  # Each market unit contains 32 items

# 重置二位 (interpreted as starting with two positions)
左位 = 外周
右位 = 每市

# 左位減八餘加右位，至盡虛加一
while 左位 > 0:
    左位 -= 8  # Subtract 8 from the left position
    if 左位 < 0:
        左位 = 0  # Ensure no negative values
    右位 += 左位  # Add the remainder to the right position

# 至盡虛加一
a = 右位 + 1  # Add 1 to the result

# The total number of items is stored in `a`.
