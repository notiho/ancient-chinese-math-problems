今有冥谷上廣二丈，袤七丈，下廣八尺，袤四丈，深六丈五尺。問︰積幾何？
荅曰：五萬二千尺。
載土往來二百步，載輸之間一里，程行五十八里，六人共車，車載三十四尺七寸。問︰人到積尺及用徒各幾何？
術曰：以一車積尺乘程行步數為實。置今往來步數，加載輸之間一里，以車六人乘之，為法。除之，所得即一人所到尺。以所到約積尺，即用徒人數。
荅曰：人到 a尺 。用徒 b人 。

Suppose there is a valley with the following dimensions:
- The top width is 2 zhang, and the length is 7 zhang.
- The bottom width is 8 chi, and the length is 4 zhang.
- The depth is 6 zhang and 5 chi.

Question: What is the total volume?

Answer: 52000 cubic chi.

For transporting the soil:
- The round-trip distance is 200 bu.
- The distance between the loading and unloading points is 1 li.
- The total journey is 58 li.
- 6 people share a cart, and the cart carries 34 chi and 7 cun of soil.

Question: How much soil does each person transport, and how many workers are needed?

The procedure says:
- Multiply the volume of one cart by the total journey distance (in bu) to get the dividend.
- Add the round-trip distance and the 1 li transport distance, then multiply by the 6 people per cart to get the divisor.
- Divide the dividend by the divisor to get the volume transported by one person.
- Divide the total volume by the volume transported by one person to get the number of workers needed.

Answer: Each person transports *a* cubic chi. The number of workers needed is *b*.
