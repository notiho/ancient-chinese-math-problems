今有出錢五百七十六，買竹七十八箇。欲其大小率之，問︰各幾何？
其率術曰：各置所買石、鈞、斤、兩以為法，以所率乘錢數為實，實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法賤實貴。
荅曰：其 a箇 ，箇 b錢 。其 c箇 ，箇 d錢 。

This problem involves dividing a total cost of 576 coins among 78 bamboo pieces, with the pieces being of two different sizes (large and small) and their respective prices needing to be determined. The procedure involves proportional allocation based on the given rates.

However, the problem statement is incomplete as it does not provide the specific rates or proportions for the large and small bamboo pieces. Without this critical information, it is impossible to calculate the exact distribution of the bamboo pieces and their respective costs.

If you can provide the rates or proportions for the large and small bamboo pieces, I can proceed with solving the problem.
