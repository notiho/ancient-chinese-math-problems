Represent the problem as a system of linear equations.\n2. Use elimination and substitution to solve for the unknowns.\n\n### Conversion:\n1 dou = 10 sheng.\n\n### Equations:\nLet `x` be the grain in one bundle of upper millet (in sheng), and `y` be the grain in one bundle of lower millet (in sheng).\n\nFrom the problem:\n1. \\( 5x - 7y = 11 \\) (1 dou 1 sheng = 10 + 1 = 11 sheng)\n2. \\( 7x - 5y = 25 \\) (2 dou 5 sheng = 20 + 5 = 25 sheng)\n\nWe solve this system of equations using the fangcheng method.\n\n### Python Code:\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Coefficients of the equations\n# Equation 1: 5x - 7y = 11\na1, b1, c1 = 5, -7, 11\n\n# Equation 2: 7x - 5y = 25\na2, b2, c2 = 7, -5, 25\n\n# Step 1: Eliminate one variable (e.g., y) using the fangcheng method\n# Multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 7 to align the coefficients of y\neq1_mult = 5\neq2_mult = 7\n\na1, b1, c1 = a1 * eq1_mult, b1 * eq1_mult, c1 * eq1_mult\na2, b2, c2 = a2 * eq2_mult, b2 * eq2_mult, c2 * eq2_mult\n\n# Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate y\na = a1 - a2\nb = b1 - b2\nc = c1 - c2\n\n# Now we have a new equation: ax = c\n# Solve for x (grain in one bundle of upper millet)\nx = Fraction(c, a)\n\n# Step 2: Substitute x back into one of the original equations to solve for y\n# Using the first equation: 5x - 7y = 11\ny = Fraction((c1 - a1 * x), b1)\n\n# Convert x and y to sheng\na = x  # Grain in one bundle of upper millet (in sheng)\nb = y  # Grain in one bundle of lower millet (in sheng)\n\n# Output the results\na, b\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. The coefficients of the equations are scaled to align the coefficients of one variable (here, `y`).\n2. The equations are subtracted to eliminate `y`, leaving an equation in terms of `x`.\n3. `x` is solved, and its value is substituted back into one of the original equations to solve for `y`.\n4.
