Suppose it takes 16 days, but it exceeds by 140 li.\nMultiply the excess and shortfall by their respective assumed days, then add them to form the dividend.\nAdd the excess and shortfall to form the divisor.\nDivide the dividend by the divisor to get the number of days. If there is a remainder, divide it by the common difference to determine the fraction.\n\nAnswer: they meet after *a* days. The fine horse travels *b* li. The slow horse travels *c* li.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# \u9f4a\u53bb\u9577\u5b89\u4e09\u5343\u91cc\n\u7e3d\u8ddd\u96e2 = 3000\n\n# \u826f\u99ac\u521d\u65e5\u884c\u4e00\u767e\u4e5d\u5341\u4e09\u91cc\uff0c\u65e5\u589e\u5341\u4e09\u91cc\n\u826f\u99ac\u521d\u65e5 = 193\n\u826f\u99ac\u65e5\u589e = 13\n\n# \u99d1\u99ac\u521d\u65e5\u884c\u4e5d\u5341\u4e03\u91cc\uff0c\u65e5\u6e1b\u534a\u91cc\n\u99d1\u99ac\u521d\u65e5 = 97\n\u99d1\u99ac\u65e5\u6e1b = Fraction(1, 2)\n\n# \u5047\u4ee4\u5341\u4e94\u65e5\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e09\u767e\u4e09\u5341\u4e03\u91cc\u534a\n\u5047\u4ee4_1 = 15\n\u4e0d\u8db3 = 337.5\n\n# \u4ee4\u4e4b\u5341\u516d\u65e5\uff0c\u591a\u4e00\u767e\u56db\u5341\u91cc\n\u5047\u4ee4_2 = 16\n\u591a = 140\n\n# \u4ee5\u76c8\u3001\u4e0d\u8db3\u7dad\u4e58\u5047\u4ee4\u4e4b\u6578\uff0c\u5e76\u800c\u70ba\u5be6\n\u5be6 = (\u591a * \u5047\u4ee4_1) + (\u4e0d\u8db3 * \u5047\u4ee4_2)\n\n# \u5e76\u76c8\u4e0d\u8db3\u70ba\u6cd5\n\u6cd5 = \u591a + \u4e0d\u8db3\n\n# \u5be6\u5982\u6cd5\u800c\u4e00\uff0c\u5f97\u65e5\u6578\n\u65e5\u6578 = Fraction(\u5be6, \u6cd5)\n\n# \u4e0d\u76e1\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u7b49\u6578\u9664\u4e4b\u800c\u547d\u5206 (no remainder here, so no fractional adjustment needed)\n\n# \u8a08\u7b97\u826f\u99ac\u8207\u99d1\u99ac\u5404\u884c\u5e7e\u4f55\n\u826f\u99ac\u884c = sum(\u826f\u99ac\u521d\u65e5 + i * \u826f\u99ac\u65e5\u589e for i in range(int(\u65e5\u6578)))\n\u99d1\u99ac\u884c = sum(\u99d1\u99ac\u521d\u65e5 - i * \u99d1\u99ac\u65e5\u6e1b for i in range(int(\u65e5\u6578)))\n\n# \u826f\u99ac\u8fd4\u56de\u8fce\u99d1\u99ac\u7684\u8ddd\u96e2\n\u826f\u99ac\u8fd4\u56de\u8ddd\u96e2 = \u7e3d\u8ddd\u96e2 - \u99d1\u99ac\u884c\n\u826f\u99ac\u884c += \u826f\u99ac\u8fd4\u56de\u8ddd\u96e2\n\n# \u7b54\u6848\na = \u65e5\u6578\nb = \u826f\u99ac\u884c\nc = \u99d1\u99ac\u884c", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1980, "completion_tokens": 3159, "total_tokens": 5139, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_60a3f2dc65"}}, "error": null}
