Suppose for 3 days, the total progress exceeds 3 chi and 7.5 cun.\nThe \"excess and deficiency\" procedure says: Place the rates of progress, and put the excess and deficiency below them respectively.\nMultiply the rates of progress by their respective days, and add them together to form the dividend.\nAdd the excess and deficiency together to form the divisor.\nDivide the dividend by the divisor to find the number of days. If there is a remainder, adjust it accordingly.\nFor the total progress of both mice, place their rates of progress, subtract the smaller from the larger, and simplify the divisor and dividend.\nThe dividend represents the total progress, and the divisor represents the number of days.\n\nAnswer: *a* days. The large mouse digs *b* chi, and the small mouse digs *c* chi.\n\"\"\"\n\n# \u57a3\u539a\u4e94\u5c3a\n\u57a3\u539a = 5\n\n# \u5927\u9f20\u65e5\u4e00\u5c3a\uff0c\u5c0f\u9f20\u4ea6\u65e5\u4e00\u5c3a\n\u5927\u9f20\u521d\u901f = 1\n\u5c0f\u9f20\u521d\u901f = 1\n\n# \u5927\u9f20\u65e5\u81ea\u500d\uff0c\u5c0f\u9f20\u65e5\u81ea\u534a\n\u5927\u9f20\u901f\u7387 = [\u5927\u9f20\u521d\u901f * (2 ** i) for i in range(10)]  # Generate rates for 10 days\n\u5c0f\u9f20\u901f\u7387 = [\u5c0f\u9f20\u521d\u901f * (1 / (2 ** i)) for i in range(10)]  # Generate rates for 10 days\n\n# \u5047\u4ee4\u4e8c\u65e5\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e94\u5bf8\n\u4e0d\u8db3 = Fraction(5, 10)  # 5 cun = 0.5 chi\n\n# \u4ee4\u4e4b\u4e09\u65e5\uff0c\u6709\u9918\u4e09\u5c3a\u4e03\u5bf8\u534a\n\u6709\u9918 = 3 + Fraction(7.5, 10)  # 3 chi and 7.5 cun = 3.75 chi\n\n# \u76c8\u4e0d\u8db3\u8853\n# \u7f6e\u6240\u51fa\u7387\uff0c\u76c8\u3001\u4e0d\u8db3\u5404\u5c45\u5176\u4e0b\n\u76c8\u65e5 = 3\n\u4e0d\u8db3\u65e5 = 2\n\n\u76c8\u901f\u7387 = sum(\u5927\u9f20\u901f\u7387[:\u76c8\u65e5]) + sum(\u5c0f\u9f20\u901f\u7387[:\u76c8\u65e5])\n\u4e0d\u8db3\u901f\u7387 = sum(\u5927\u9f20\u901f\u7387[:\u4e0d\u8db3\u65e5]) + sum(\u5c0f\u9f20\u901f\u7387[:\u4e0d\u8db3\u65e5])\n\n# \u4ee4\u7dad\u4e58\u6240\u51fa\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u70ba\u5be6\n\u5be6 = (\u76c8\u901f\u7387 * \u4e0d\u8db3) + (\u4e0d\u8db3\u901f\u7387 * \u6709\u9918)\n\n# \u5e76\u76c8\u3001\u4e0d\u8db3\u70ba\u6cd5\n\u6cd5 = \u6709\u9918 + \u4e0d\u8db3\n\n# \u5be6\u5982\u6cd5\u800c\u4e00\na = Fraction(\u5be6, \u6cd5)\n\n# \u8a08\u7b97\u5404\u9f20\u7a7f\u591a\u5c11\n\u5927\u9f20\u7a7f = sum(\u5927\u9f20\u901f\u7387[:int(a)])\n\u5c0f\u9f20\u7a7f = sum(\u5c0f\u9f20\u901f\u7387[:int(a)])\n\nb = \u5927\u9f20\u7a7f\nc = \u5c0f\u9f20\u7a7f", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1978, "completion_tokens": 3405, "total_tokens": 5383, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_60a3f2dc65"}}, "error": null}
