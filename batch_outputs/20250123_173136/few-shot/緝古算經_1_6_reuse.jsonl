The solution uses `Fraction` to ensure precise calculations, as ancient Chinese mathematics often involved fractional values.\n2. The cubic root (`pow(x, 1/3)`) is used to solve for dimensions, as the problem involves cubic relationships.\n3. The units are consistent with the problem statement: `chi` for lengths and `shi` for volumes.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2110, "completion_tokens": 5662, "total_tokens": 7772, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_60a3f2dc65"}}, "error": null}
