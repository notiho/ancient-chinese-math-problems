The profit rate is 13%. After five returns, the money (principal + profit) is completely exhausted. The amounts returned are as follows:\n- First return: 14,000\n- Second return: 13,000\n- Third return: 12,000\n- Fourth return: 11,000\n- Fifth return: 10,000\n\nWe are tasked with finding the original principal (*a* \u9322) and the total profit (*b* \u9322).\n\n### Procedure:\nThe \"\u76c8\u4e0d\u8db3\u8853\" (Excess and Deficiency Method) is used to solve this problem.
