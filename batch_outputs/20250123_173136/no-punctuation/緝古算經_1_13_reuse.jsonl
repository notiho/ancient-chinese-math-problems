Here's the solution:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSuppose there are 26,342 shi and 4 dou of millet, and it is desired to construct 6 square granaries and 4 circular granaries.\nLet the top and bottom of the square granaries have equal sides, and the diameter of the circular granaries be the same.\nThe depth is also the same, but let the depth be 7 chi less at the bottom and 1 zhang 4 chi more at the top.\nFill each granary completely, and the millet is exactly used up.\nQuestion: What are the depths of the top and bottom parts?\n\nThe procedure says:\n1. Multiply 42 by the hu divisor (\u659b\u6cd5) to get the total millet volume in cubic chi.\n2. Multiply the millet volume by 384 and divide by 1 to get the cubic chi for the square granaries.\n3. Let the difference in depth (\u65b9\u5dee) be self-multiplied and then multiplied by 3 and divided by 1 to get the \"corner shadow power\" (\u9685\u967d\u51aa).\n4. Multiply the \"corner shadow power\" by the greater depth (\u591a) and subtract it from the total volume to get the remainder (\u5be6).\n5. Multiply the greater depth (\u591a) by the difference in depth (\u5dee) and add the \"corner shadow power\" to get the divisor (\u65b9\u6cd5).\n6. Add the greater depth (\u591a) to the difference in depth (\u5dee) to get the \"edge divisor\" (\u5ec9\u6cd5).\n7. Solve the cubic equation to find the depth of the upper part (\u4e0a\u65b9).\n8. Add the difference in depth (\u5dee) to the upper depth to get the lower depth (\u4e0b\u65b9).\n\nAnswer: The square granary's upper depth is *a* chi, the lower depth is *b* zhang, and the total depth is *c* zhang.\nThe circular granary's upper and lower diameters and depths are the same as the square granary.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# \u7c9f\u4e8c\u842c\u516d\u5343\u4e09\u767e\u56db\u5341\u4e8c\u77f3\u56db\u6597\n\u7c9f\u77f3 = 26342\n\u7c9f\u6597 = 4\n\n# Convert \u7c9f to cubic chi (1 \u77f3 = 10 \u6597, 1 \u6597 = 10 cubic chi)\n\u7c9f = (\u7c9f\u77f3 * 10 + \u7c9f\u6597) * 10\n\n# \u65b9\u7a96\u516d\uff0c\u5713\u7a96\u56db\n\u65b9\u7a96\u6578 = 6\n\u5713\u7a96\u6578 = 4\n\n# \u4ee4\u6df1\u5c11\u65bc\u4e0b\u65b9\u4e03\u5c3a\uff0c\u591a\u65bc\u4e0a\u65b9\u4e00\u4e08\u56db\u5c3a\n\u5dee = Fraction(7 + 14 * 10, 10)  # Convert to chi\n\n# \u4ee5\u56db\u5341\u4e8c\u4e58\u659b\u6cd5\n\u659b\u6cd5 = 42\n\u7e3d\u7a4d = \u7c9f * \u659b\u6cd5\n\n# \u4ee5\u4e58\u7c9f\u4e09\u767e\u516b\u5341\u56db\u800c\u4e00\uff0c\u70ba\u65b9\u4ead\u7a4d\u5c3a\n\u65b9\u4ead\u7a4d\u5c3a = Fraction(\u7e3d\u7a4d * 384, 1)\n\n# Let \u65b9\u5dee\u81ea\u4e58\u4e09\u800c\u4e00\uff0c\u70ba\u9685\u967d\u51aa\n\u9685\u967d\u51aa = Fraction(\u5dee**2 * 3, 1)\n\n# Iteratively solve for \u4e0a\u65b9 (upper depth)\n\u591a = Fraction(1)  # Initial guess for the greater depth\ntolerance = Fraction(1, 10000)  # Tolerance for iterative solution\n\nwhile True:\n    # \u4ee5\u591a\u4e58\u4e4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6e1b\u7a4d\u4f59\uff0c\u70ba\u5be6\n    \u5be6 = \u65b9\u4ead\u7a4d\u5c3a - \u9685\u967d\u51aa * \u591a\n\n    # \u4ee5\u591a\u4e58\u5dee\uff0c\u52a0\u51aa\uff0c\u70ba\u65b9\u6cd5\n    \u65b9\u6cd5 = \u591a * \u5dee + \u9685\u967d\u51aa\n\n    # Update \u591a (greater depth)\n    \u65b0\u591a = \u5be6 / \u65b9\u6cd5\n    if abs(\u65b0\u591a - \u591a) < tolerance:\n        break\n    \u591a = \u65b0\u591a\n\n# \u4e0a\u65b9 (upper depth)\n\u4e0a\u65b9 = \u591a\n\n# \u4e0b\u65b9 (lower depth)\n\u4e0b\u65b9 = \u4e0a\u65b9 + \u5dee\n\n# Total depth\n\u7e3d\u6df1 = \u4e0a\u65b9 + \u4e0b\u65b9\n\n# Convert \u4e0b\u65b9 and \u7e3d\u6df1 to zhang\n\u4e0b\u65b9\u4e08 = \u4e0b\u65b9 / 10\n\u7e3d\u6df1\u4e08 = \u7e3d\u6df1 / 10\n\n# Answer\na = \u4e0a\u65b9\nb = \u4e0b\u65b9\u4e08\nc = \u7e3d\u6df1\u4e08\n``` \n\nThis code follows the ancient procedure step by step, using fractions to ensure precision.

Let the difference between the top and bottom side lengths be the \"\u5dee\" (difference).\n4. Square the difference and multiply by 3, then divide by 1 to get the \"\u9685\u967d\u51aa\" (corner excess).\n5.
