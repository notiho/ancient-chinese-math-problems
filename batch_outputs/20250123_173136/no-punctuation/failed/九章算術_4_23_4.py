Suppose there is a volume of 1,648,466,437,500 cubic chi.
Question: what is the diameter of the sphere?

The procedure for finding the diameter of a sphere says: 
Take the volume in cubic chi, multiply it by 16, and divide it by 9.
Take the cube root of the result, and that is the diameter of the sphere.

Answer: the diameter is *a* chi.
