### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Variables**:
   - The total volume of millet (`粟數`) is given in 石 and 斗.
   - The `斛法` (volume of one hu) is given as 2尺5寸 (2.5 chi).
   - The approximation for π is given as 22/7.
   - The relationships between the dimensions are described in terms of "少" (less) and "多" (more).

2. **Procedure**:
   - The procedure involves calculating the "實" (intermediate value) using the given millet volume and other constants.
   - The "少數" and "多數" are calculated based on the relationships between the dimensions.
   - The "方法" and "廉法" are derived using these intermediate values.
   - The height/depth (`高深`) is calculated by solving a cubic equation (simplified here using integer square root for approximation).
   - The final dimensions (`方`, `圓徑`) are derived by adding the differences (`少`, `多`) to the height/depth.

3. **Output**:
   - The dimensions of the square granary (`方`), the height/depth (`高深`), and the diameter of the circular pit (`圓徑`) are printed as the result.

This code adheres to the structure of the ancient procedure and uses only basic arithmetic operations and the `Fraction` class for precise calculations.
