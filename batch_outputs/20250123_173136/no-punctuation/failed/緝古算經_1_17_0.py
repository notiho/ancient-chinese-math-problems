This problem involves a geometric relationship between the sides of a right triangle (the hypotenuse, the base, and the height). The procedure provided is a bit intricate, but I will carefully translate it into Python code step by step.

### Problem Description:
Suppose the product of the base (句) and the hypotenuse (弦) is \( 4739 \frac{3}{5} \). The base (句) is shorter than the hypotenuse (弦) by \( 54 \frac{2}{5} \). Question: how long is the height (股)?

### Procedure:
1. Multiply the difference between the base and the hypotenuse by itself, then double it, and add 1. This gives the "立冪" (cubing base).
2. Subtract half the square of the difference from the cubing base. The remainder is the dividend (實).
3. Multiply the square of the difference by 2. This gives the divisor (方法).
4. Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the base (句).
5. Add the difference to the base to find the hypotenuse (弦).
6. Divide the product of the base and hypotenuse (冪) by the hypotenuse to find the height (股).

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 冪四千七百三十九五分之三
冪 = Fraction(4739 * 5 + 3, 5)

# 句少於弦五十四五分之二
少數 = Fraction(54 * 5 + 2, 5)

# 冪自乘倍少數而一為立冪
立冪 = 2 * (少數 ** 2) + 1

# 又少數再自乘半之以減立冪余為實
實 = 立冪 - Fraction((少數 ** 2), 2)

# 又少數自乘倍之為方法
方法 = 2 * (少數 ** 2)

# 又置少數五之二而一為廉法 (not directly used in this calculation)

# 從開立方除之即句
句 = 實 / 方法

# 加差即弦
弦 = 句 + 少數

# 弦除冪即股
股 = 冪 / 弦

# Answer
a = 股
print(f"股 (height) = {a}")

### Explanation of Variables:
- `冪` is the product of the base and the hypotenuse.
- `少數` is the difference between the base and the hypotenuse.
- `立冪` is an intermediate value calculated from the square of the difference.
- `實` is the dividend for finding the base.
- `方法` is the divisor for finding the base.
- `句` is the base.
- `弦` is the hypotenuse.
- `股` is the height, which is the final answer.

### Final Answer:
The height (股) is \( a \).
