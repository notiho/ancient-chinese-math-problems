今有甲禾二秉乙禾三秉丙禾四秉重皆過於石甲二重如乙一乙三重如丙一丙四重如甲一問甲乙丙禾一秉各重幾何
術曰如方程置重過於石之物為負以正負術入之
方程術曰置上禾三秉中禾二秉下禾一秉實三十九斗於右方中左禾列如右方以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除又乘其次亦以直除然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除左方下禾不盡者上為法下為實實即下禾之實求中禾以法乘中行下實而除下禾之實餘如中禾秉數而一即中禾之實求上禾亦以法乘右行下實而除下禾中禾之實餘如上禾秉數而一即上禾之實實皆如法各得一斗
荅曰甲禾一秉重 a石 乙禾一秉重 b石 丙禾一秉重 c石

This problem involves solving a system of equations using the ancient Chinese method of "方程術" (method of solving simultaneous equations). The problem describes the weights of bundles of grain (禾) and their relationships. Here's the solution translated into Python:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Problem setup
# Let the weights of one bundle of 甲禾, 乙禾, and 丙禾 be x, y, and z respectively.
# The relationships are:
# 1. 甲禾二秉 (2x) + 乙禾三秉 (3y) + 丙禾四秉 (4z) = 1石 (39斗)
# 2. 甲禾二重如乙一 (2x = y)
# 3. 乙禾三重如丙一 (3y = z)
# 4. 丙禾四重如甲一 (4z = x)

# Step 1: Solve the relationships
# From 2x = y, we get y = 2x
# From 3y = z, we get z = 3y = 3(2x) = 6x
# From 4z = x, we get x = 4z = 4(6x) = 24x, which implies x = 0 (contradiction).
# The relationships are inconsistent as stated.
