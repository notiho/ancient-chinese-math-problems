"""
This is a complex ancient Chinese mathematical problem involving the extraction of a cube root for a given volume. The procedure described is the "Kai Li Fang Shu" (開立方術), or the cube root extraction method. I'll translate the procedure into Python code step by step.

The given volume is \( 1937541 \frac{27}{17} \) chi³, which is a mixed number. We'll first convert it into a single fraction for easier computation.

### Procedure Explanation:
1. Place the volume as the dividend.
2. Borrow a trial number (guess) for the cube root and test it.
3. Multiply the trial number by itself twice (cube it) and compare it to the volume.
4. Adjust the trial number iteratively using the described method until the cube root is found or the remainder is negligible.
5. If the volume has a fractional part, handle it by converting it into a single fraction and proceed with the cube root extraction.

### Python Implementation:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 積一百九十三萬七千五百四十一尺二十七分尺之一十七
積 = Fraction(1937541) + Fraction(27, 17)

# 開立方術
def 開立方(積):
    # Step 1: Initialize variables
    定實 = 積  # 定實 is the volume to be worked on
    立方根 = 0  # The cube root we are calculating
    步 = 1  # The trial number (guess)

    # Step 2: Iterative cube root extraction
    while True:
        # Compute the cube of the current trial number
        超 = 步 ** 3

        # If the cube exceeds the volume, stop and adjust
        if 超 > 定實:
            步 -= 1  # Step back to the previous trial number
            break

        # Otherwise, increment the trial number and continue
        步 += 1

    # Step 3: Refine the result using the described method
    立方根 = 步  # Start with the integer part of the cube root
    餘數 = 定實 - (立方根 ** 3)  # Calculate the remainder

    # If there is a remainder, refine the result
    if 餘數 > 0:
        分母 = 3 * (立方根 ** 2)  # Denominator for refinement
        分數部分 = Fraction(餘數, 分母)  # Fractional part of the cube root
        立方根 += 分數部分  # Add the fractional part to the cube root

    return 立方根

# Calculate the cube root
a = 開立方(積)

# Output the result
a


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: The given volume is converted into a fraction for precise computation.
2. **Iterative Cube Root Extraction**: The trial number (`步`) is incremented until its cube exceeds the volume. The last valid trial number is taken as the integer part of the cube root.
3. **Refinement**: If there is a remainder after subtracting the cube of the integer part, the fractional part of the cube root is calculated using the described method.
4. **Output**: The final cube root is returned as a fraction.

### Answer:
The cube root of \( 1937541 \frac{27}{17} \) chi³ is \( a \) chi.
