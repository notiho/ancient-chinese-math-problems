Suppose there is a group buying gold. One group contributes 400 and has an excess of 3000, while another group contributes 300 and has an excess of 100.
Question: how many people are there, and what is the price of the gold?

The procedure for two excesses and two deficits says:
Place the contribution rates and the excesses/deficits below them.
Multiply the contribution rates by the excesses/deficits.
Subtract the smaller result from the larger result, and the remainder becomes the dividend.
For the divisor, subtract the smaller contribution rate from the larger contribution rate.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to obtain the result. If there is a fraction, simplify it.

Answer: there are *a* people, and the price of the gold is *b*.
