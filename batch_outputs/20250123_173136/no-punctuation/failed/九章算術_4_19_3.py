The problem involves finding the cube root of a given volume, expressed as \(1953 \frac{1}{8}\) cubic chi. The procedure for extracting cube roots is detailed and involves iterative steps. Below is the Python implementation of the procedure:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 積一千九百五十三尺八分尺之一
積 = Fraction(1953, 1) + Fraction(1, 8)

# 開立方術
# Step 1: 通分內子為定實
定實 = 積

# Initialize variables
已開 = 0  # The part of the cube root already determined
餘數 = 定實  # The remaining part to be processed

# Step 2: Iteratively extract the cube root
while True:
    # 借一算，步之超二等議所得
    借 = 1
    while (已開 + 借) ** 3 <= 定實:
        借 += 1
    借 -= 1  # Step back to the last valid 借

    # Update 已開 and 餘數
    已開 += 借
    餘數 = 定實 - 已開 ** 3

    # Check if the remainder is zero (i.e., the cube root is exact)
    if 餘數 == 0:
        break

    # If not exact, continue the process
    # Update 定實 for the next iteration
    定實 = 餘數

    # If the remainder cannot be further processed, break
    if 借 == 0:
        break

# The cube root is the value of 已開
a = 已開

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The given volume \(1953 \frac{1}{8}\) is converted into a fraction for precise calculations.
   - Variables `已開` (the part of the cube root already determined) and `餘數` (the remaining part to be processed) are initialized.

2. **Iterative Cube Root Extraction**:
   - The algorithm iteratively determines the largest possible value of `借` such that \((已開 + 借)^3 \leq 定實\).
   - The value of `已開` is updated, and the remainder (`餘數`) is recalculated.
   - If the remainder becomes zero, the process stops, and the cube root is exact.

3. **Handling Non-Exact Roots**:
   - If the cube root cannot be determined exactly, the process stops when no further progress can be made.

4. **Result**:
   - The cube root is stored in the variable `a`.

This implementation follows the ancient Chinese procedure for extracting cube roots, as described in the problem.
