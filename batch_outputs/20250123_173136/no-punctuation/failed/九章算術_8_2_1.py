This is a classic problem involving a system of linear equations, where the weights of the grains (upper, middle, and lower) are determined based on the given constraints. Let's translate the problem and solution into Python code step by step.

---

### Problem Description:
There are three types of grains:
- Upper grain: 2 bundles
- Middle grain: 3 bundles
- Lower grain: 4 bundles

Each bundle does not fill a dou (a unit of volume). When:
- 1 bundle of upper grain is taken with 1 bundle of middle grain,
- 1 bundle of middle grain is taken with 1 bundle of lower grain,
- 1 bundle of lower grain is taken with 1 bundle of upper grain,

The total volume becomes exactly 1 dou.

**Question**: What is the volume of 1 bundle of upper grain, middle grain, and lower grain?

---

### Procedure:
The solution involves solving a system of linear equations using the method described in the text. The equations are derived as follows:

1. Let:
   - `a` = volume of 1 bundle of upper grain,
   - `b` = volume of 1 bundle of middle grain,
   - `c` = volume of 1 bundle of lower grain.

2. From the problem:
   - \( a + b = 1 \)
   - \( b + c = 1 \)
   - \( c + a = 1 \)

3. Solve these equations to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

---

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Define the equations:
# a + b = 1
# b + c = 1
# c + a = 1

# Step 1: Express the equations in terms of a, b, and c
# From the first equation: b = 1 - a
# Substitute b into the second equation: (1 - a) + c = 1 -> c = a
# Substitute c into the third equation: a + a = 1 -> a = 1/2

# Step 2: Solve for b and c
a = Fraction(1, 2)  # Volume of 1 bundle of upper grain
b = 1 - a           # Volume of 1 bundle of middle grain
c = a               # Volume of 1 bundle of lower grain

# Output the results
print(f"上禾一秉實 a斗: {a}")
print(f"中禾一秉實 b斗: {b}")
print(f"下禾一秉實 c斗: {c}")


"""


---

### Explanation of the Code:
1. The equations are solved step by step using substitution, as described in the procedure.
2. The `Fraction` class is used to ensure exact arithmetic with fractions.
3. The results are printed in terms of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), which represent the volumes of 1 bundle of upper, middle, and lower grains, respectively.

---

### Answer:
- \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) dou (upper grain),
- \( b = \frac{1}{2} \) dou (middle grain),
- \( c = \frac{1}{2} \) dou (lower grain).
