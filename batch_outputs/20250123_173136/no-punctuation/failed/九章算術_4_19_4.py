This problem involves finding the cube root of a given volume, expressed as \(1953 \frac{1}{8}\) cubic chi. The procedure for extracting the cube root is described in the "開立方術" (method for extracting the cube root). Below is the Python implementation of the procedure step by step:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 積一千九百五十三尺八分尺之一
積 = Fraction(1953, 1) + Fraction(1, 8)

# 開立方術
# Step 1: 通分內子為定實 (Convert the volume into a fraction if it includes parts)
定實 = 積

# Step 2: 開立方 (Extract the cube root)
# Initialize variables
商 = 0  # The result (cube root) starts at 0
餘 = 定實  # The remainder starts as the full volume
步 = 1  # The trial divisor starts at 1

while True:
    # 借一算步之超二等議所得 (Find the largest trial divisor such that the cube of 商 + 步 does not exceed 餘)
    while (商 + 步) ** 3 > 餘:
        步 -= Fraction(1, 10)  # Decrease the trial divisor by a small step (e.g., 0.1)

    # Update 商 (商 += 步)
    商 += 步

    # 再乘所借一算為法而除之 (Calculate the new remainder)
    餘 = 定實 - 商 ** 3

    # Check if the remainder is small enough to stop
    if abs(餘) < Fraction(1, 1000):  # Precision threshold
        break

# The result is 商
a = 商

print(f"The cube root is approximately {a} chi.")


"""


### Explanation of the Procedure:
1. **Convert the Volume to a Fraction**: If the volume includes fractional parts, convert it into a single fraction for easier computation.
2. **Iterative Cube Root Extraction**:
   - Start with an initial guess for the cube root (`商`), which is 0.
   - Gradually increase the guess (`步`) until the cube of the guess exceeds the remaining volume (`餘`).
   - Subtract the cube of the current guess from the volume to update the remainder.
   - Repeat the process until the remainder is sufficiently small, indicating that the cube root has been found to the desired precision.

### Final Answer:
The cube root of \(1953 \frac{1}{8}\) chi is approximately \(a\) chi.
