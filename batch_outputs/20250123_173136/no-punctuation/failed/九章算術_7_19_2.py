This problem involves a classic "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method) to solve for the principal amount of money and the profit based on a series of returns. Here's the solution encoded in Python:


"""


"""
Suppose someone holds money to trade in Shu, gaining a profit of 13% each time.
Initially, they return with 14,000 coins, then 13,000 coins, then 12,000 coins, then 11,000 coins, and finally 10,000 coins.
In total, they return five times, and the principal and profit are completely exhausted.
Question: What are the principal money and the profit?

The procedure says: Assume the principal money to be 30,000 coins. It is insufficient by 1,738.5 coins.
Assume it to be 40,000 coins. It exceeds by 3,539.8 coins.

The "Excess and Deficiency Method" says: Place the given rates of excess and deficiency below each other.
Multiply the assumed principal amounts by the rates and add them to form the dividend.
Add the excess and deficiency rates to form the divisor.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the principal amount. If there is a remainder, convert it into fractions.
The excess and deficiency are balanced.

Answer: The principal is *a* coins, and the profit is *b* coins.

"""


### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: Two assumed values for the principal are given (30,000 and 40,000 coins), along with their respective deficiencies and excesses.
2. **Excess and Deficiency Method**: This method balances the excess and deficiency to calculate the actual principal.
3. **Profit Calculation**: The total profit is calculated based on the principal, the profit rate (13%), and the number of returns (5).
4. **Results**: The principal (`a`) and the profit (`b`) are calculated and represented as fractions for precision.
