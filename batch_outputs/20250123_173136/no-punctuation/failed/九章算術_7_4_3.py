Suppose there is a group of people buying gold. 
One group of 400 people contributes 3 qian per person, and there is an excess of 3400 qian.
Another group of 300 people contributes 1 qian per person, and there is an excess of 100 qian.
Question: how many people are there in total, and what is the price of the gold?

The procedure for "two excesses and two deficits" says:
Place the contribution rates and the excess/deficit amounts below each other.
Multiply the contribution rates by the respective excess/deficit amounts.
Subtract the smaller product from the larger product, and the remainder becomes the dividend.
Subtract the smaller contribution rate from the larger contribution rate, and the remainder becomes the divisor.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the number of people. If there is a fraction, simplify it.
The price of the gold is then calculated using the total number of people.

Answer: there are *a* people, and the price of the gold is *b* qian.
