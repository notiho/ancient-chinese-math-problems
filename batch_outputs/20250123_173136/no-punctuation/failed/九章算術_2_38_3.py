今有出錢一千一百二十買絲一石二鈞十八斤欲其貴賤斤率之問各幾何

The problem and procedure provided are quite intricate, and the explanation is somewhat ambiguous. To ensure clarity and correctness, I will carefully interpret and encode the procedure step by step. Here's the problem and its solution:

---

"""
Suppose there is an expenditure of 1120 qian to buy silk weighing 1 shi, 2 jun, and 18 jin. 
It is desired to determine the price per jin (unit rate) for both expensive and cheap rates.

The procedure says: 
Place the quantities of shi, jun, jin, and liang as the divisor (法). 
Multiply the total money (錢數) by the respective rates to obtain the dividend (實). 
Divide the dividend by the divisor to get the unit rate. 
If the remainder is less than the divisor, subtract the remainder from the divisor. 
The divisor corresponds to the cheaper rate, and the dividend corresponds to the expensive rate.

Answer: The expensive rate is *a* qian per jun and *b* qian per jin. 
The cheaper rate is *c* qian per shi and *d* qian per jin.

# 出錢一千一百二十
錢數 = 1120

# 買絲一石二鈞十八斤
石 = 1
鈞 = 2
斤 = 18

# 將石、鈞、斤轉換為總斤數
# 1 石 = 120 斤, 1 鈞 = 30 斤
總斤數 = 石 * 120 + 鈞 * 30 + 斤

# 以總斤數為法
法 = 總斤數

# 以所率乘錢數為實
實 = 錢數

# 實如法而一
貴率 = Fraction(實, 法)

# 不滿法者反以實減法
賤率 = 法 - (實 % 法)

# 計算貴賤率
a = 貴率.numerator // 30  # 貴率每鈞的錢數
b = 貴率.numerator % 30   # 貴率每斤的錢數

c = 賤率 // 120  # 賤率每石的錢數
d = 賤率 % 120   # 賤率每斤的錢數

# The expensive rate is a qian per jun and b qian per jin.
# The cheaper rate is c qian per shi and d qian per jin.
