Suppose one goes out and sees 9 dikes. Each dike has 9 trees. Each tree has 9 branches. Each branch has 9 nests. Each nest has 9 birds. Each bird has 9 chicks. Each chick has 9 feathers. Each feather has 9 colors.
Question: how many of each are there?

The procedure says: Place 9 dikes. Multiply by 9 to get the number of trees. Multiply by 9 again to get the number of branches. Multiply by 9 again to get the number of nests. Multiply by 9 again to get the number of birds. Multiply by 9 again to get the number of chicks. Multiply by 9 again to get the number of feathers. Multiply by 9 again to get the number of colors.

Answer: *a* trees, *b* branches, *c* nests, *d* birds, *e* chicks, *f* feathers, *g* colors.
