Suppose there is an arc-shaped field with a chord length of 80 bu and an arrow height of 5 bu.
Question: how large is the field?

The procedure says: Take the chord length of 80 bu, halve it to get 40 bu.
Multiply it by the arrow height of 5 bu, and the result is the area.

Answer: *a* bu².

# 弦八十步
弦 = 80

半弦 = 弦 / 2

# 矢五步
矢 = 5

# 以矢五步乘之即得
