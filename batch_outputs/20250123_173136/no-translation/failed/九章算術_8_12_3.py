今有五家共井，甲二綆不足，如乙一綆；乙三綆不足，如丙一綆；丙四綆不足，如丁一綆；丁五綆不足，如戊一綆；戊六綆不足，如甲一綆。如各得所不足一綆，皆逮。問︰井深、綆長各幾何？
術曰：如方程，以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：井深 a丈 。甲綆長 b丈 ，乙綆長 c丈 ，丙綆長 d丈 ，丁綆長 e丈 ，戊綆長 f尺 。

This problem involves solving a system of equations using ancient Chinese methods, specifically the "正負術" (positive and negative method) and "方程術" (method of equations). I'll translate the procedure into Python code step by step.

The problem can be represented as a system of equations based on the relationships between the rope lengths and the depth of the well. Let the depth of the well be `井深 = a` (in 丈), and the rope lengths for each person be `甲綆長 = b`, `乙綆長 = c`, `丙綆長 = d`, `丁綆長 = e`, and `戊綆長 = f` (in 丈 or 尺). The relationships are:

1. \( b - 2 = c \)
2. \( c - 3 = d \)
3. \( d - 4 = e \)
4. \( e - 5 = f \)
5. \( f - 6 = b \)
6. \( a = b + 1 \) (each person needs one more rope length to reach the well depth)

Now, let's solve this step by step in Python:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Step 1: Define the relationships as equations
# Let b = rope length of 甲 (in 丈)
# Other rope lengths are expressed in terms of b
b = Fraction(0)  # Placeholder for solving
c = b - 2
d = c - 3
e = d - 4
f = e - 5

# Step 2: Solve for b using the cyclic relationship
# f - 6 = b
b = Fraction(6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2, 5)  # Combine all differences and divide by 5

# Step 3: Calculate other rope lengths
c = b - 2
d = c - 3
e = d - 4
f = e - 5

# Step 4: Calculate the depth of the well
a = b + 1  # Well depth is one more than 甲's rope length

# Results
井深 = a
甲綆長 = b
乙綆長 = c
丙綆長 = d
丁綆長 = e
戊綆長 = f

# Convert to readable format
print(f"井深: {井深} 丈")
print(f"甲綆長: {甲綆長} 丈")
print(f"乙綆長: {乙綆長} 丈")
print(f"丙綆長: {丙綆長} 丈")
print(f"丁綆長: {丁綆長} 丈")
print(f"戊綆長: {戊綆長} 丈")


"""


### Explanation:
1. The cyclic relationship \( f - 6 = b \) is used to solve for \( b \) by summing all the differences and dividing by 5 (since there are 5 people).
2. Once \( b \) is determined, the other rope lengths are calculated sequentially using the given relationships.
3. The well depth \( a \) is calculated as \( b + 1 \).

### Output:
The output will provide the well depth and the rope lengths for each person in 丈.
