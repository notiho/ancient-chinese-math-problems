今有出錢六百一十，買羽二千一百翭。欲其貴賤率之，問︰各幾何？
反其率術曰：以錢數為法，所率為實，實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法少，實多。二物各以所得多少之數乘法實，即物數。

To solve this problem, we need to determine the rates of two types of feathers ("貴" and "賤") based on the total money spent and the total number of feathers purchased. Let's follow the procedure step by step:


"""


# 出錢六百一十
錢數 = 610

# 買羽二千一百翭
羽數 = 2100

# 貴賤率未知，設貴率為 a翭 一錢，賤率為 b翭 一錢
# Let 貴翭 = x (number of feathers per unit of money for expensive feathers)
# Let 賤翭 = y (number of feathers per unit of money for cheap feathers)

# 反其率術曰：以錢數為法，所率為實
法 = 錢數
實 = 羽數

# 實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法少，實多
# This step implies that we need to distribute the total feathers (實) proportionally to the total money (法).

# Let 貴翭 = a翭 一錢, 賤翭 = b翭 一錢
# Assume 貴翭 = x, 賤翭 = y, and solve for x and y such that:
# x + y = 羽數 (total feathers)
# 1/x + 1/y = 錢數 (total money spent)

# Solve the equations:
# x + y = 2100
# 1/x + 1/y = 610

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

x, y = symbols('x y')
eq1 = Eq(x + y, 2100)
eq2 = Eq(1/x + 1/y, 1/610)

solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))
a, b = solution[x], solution[y]

# 貴翭 = a翭 一錢
# 賤翭 = b翭 一錢

# Output the results
print(f"其 {a}翭 ， {b}翭 一錢")


"""


This code uses symbolic math to solve the system of equations based on the procedure described. The results will give the rates for "貴" and "賤" feathers.
