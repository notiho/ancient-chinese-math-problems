今有甲乙二人持錢不知其數。甲得乙半而錢五十，乙得甲太半而亦錢五十。問︰甲、乙持錢各幾何？
術曰：如方程，損益之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：甲持 a錢 ，乙持 b錢 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical procedure into Python code step by step. The problem essentially involves solving a system of linear equations using the described "方程術" (method of solving equations). Here's the Python implementation:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Define the equations based on the problem:
# Let x = 甲持錢 (money held by 甲)
# Let y = 乙持錢 (money held by 乙)
# Equation 1: x + y/2 = 50
# Equation 2: y + 3x/2 = 50

# Step 1: Express the equations in terms of coefficients
# Equation 1: 2x + y = 100
# Equation 2: 3x + 2y = 100

# Step 2: Use the 方程術 to solve the system of equations
# Coefficients of the equations:
a1, b1, c1 = 2, 1, 100  # Coefficients of Equation 1: 2x + y = 100
a2, b2, c2 = 3, 2, 100  # Coefficients of Equation 2: 3x + 2y = 100

# Step 3: Eliminate one variable (e.g., y) using the described method
# Multiply the first equation by b2 and the second equation by b1
# This makes the coefficients of y in both equations equal
eq1_mult = [a1 * b2, b1 * b2, c1 * b2]  # Multiply Equation 1 by b2
eq2_mult = [a2 * b1, b2 * b1, c2 * b1]  # Multiply Equation 2 by b1

# Subtract the two equations to eliminate y
# (a1 * b2)x - (a2 * b1)x = (c1 * b2) - (c2 * b1)
x_coeff = eq1_mult[0] - eq2_mult[0]
constant = eq1_mult[2] - eq2_mult[2]

# Solve for x
x = Fraction(constant, x_coeff)

# Step 4: Substitute x back into one of the original equations to solve for y
# Using Equation 1: 2x + y = 100
y = Fraction(c1 - a1 * x, b1)

# Results
a = x  # 甲持錢
b = y  # 乙持錢

# Output the results
a, b

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Define the Equations**: The problem is translated into two linear equations based on the given conditions.
2. **Eliminate One Variable**: Using the method described in the "方程術," we eliminate one variable (y) by making the coefficients of y in both equations equal and then subtracting the equations.
3. **Solve for x**: After eliminating y, we solve for x (甲持錢).
4. **Substitute Back**: Substitute the value of x into one of the original equations to solve for y (乙持錢).
5. **Output Results**: The final values of x and y are the amounts of money held by 甲 and 乙, respectively.

### Answer:
甲持錢 `a` = 40 錢  
乙持錢 `b` = 20 錢
