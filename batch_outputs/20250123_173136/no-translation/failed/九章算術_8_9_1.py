今有甲乙二人持錢不知其數。甲得乙半而錢五十，乙得甲太半而亦錢五十。問︰甲、乙持錢各幾何？
術曰：如方程，損益之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：甲持 a錢 ，乙持 b錢 。

"""
To solve this problem using the described "方程術" (method of equations), we will translate the problem into Python code step by step. The problem essentially involves solving a system of linear equations.

Let:
- `甲`'s money be `x`
- `乙`'s money be `y`

The problem gives us two equations:
1. \( x + \frac{y}{2} = 50 \)
2. \( y + \frac{3x}{2} = 50 \)

We will solve this system of equations using the described method.

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the equations
# Equation 1: x + y/2 = 50
# Equation 2: y + 3x/2 = 50

# Step 1: Represent the coefficients of the equations
# Coefficients for the first equation: x + y/2 = 50
a1 = 1  # Coefficient of x
b1 = Fraction(1, 2)  # Coefficient of y
c1 = 50  # Constant term

# Coefficients for the second equation: y + 3x/2 = 50
a2 = Fraction(3, 2)  # Coefficient of x
b2 = 1  # Coefficient of y
c2 = 50  # Constant term

# Step 2: Solve for x and y using elimination
# Multiply the first equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction in y's coefficient
a1 = a1 * 2
b1 = b1 * 2
c1 = c1 * 2

# Now the first equation becomes: 2x + y = 100
# The second equation remains: 3x/2 + y = 50

# Multiply the second equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction in x's coefficient
a2 = a2 * 2
b2 = b2 * 2
c2 = c2 * 2

# Now the second equation becomes: 3x + 2y = 100

# Step 3: Eliminate y by aligning the equations
# First equation: 2x + y = 100
# Second equation: 3x + 2y = 100

# Multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of y
a1 = a1 * 2
b1 = b1 * 2
c1 = c1 * 2

# Now the first equation becomes: 4x + 2y = 200
# The second equation remains: 3x + 2y = 100

# Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate y
x_coefficient = a1 - a2  # Coefficient of x
y_coefficient = b1 - b2  # Coefficient of y (should be 0)
constant_term = c1 - c2  # Constant term

# Solve for x
x = Fraction(constant_term, x_coefficient)

# Step 4: Solve for y using one of the original equations
# Use the first equation: 2x + y = 100
y = Fraction(c1 - (a1 * x), b1)

# Final result
a = x  # 甲's money
b = y  # 乙's money

# Output the results
a, b

### Explanation:
- The code follows the "方程術" by systematically eliminating variables and solving for the unknowns.
- Fractions are used to ensure precision, as described in the ancient method.
- The final result gives `a` (甲's money) and `b` (乙's money).
