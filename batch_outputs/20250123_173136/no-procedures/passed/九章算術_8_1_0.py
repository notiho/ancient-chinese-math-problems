今有上禾七秉，損實一斗，益之下禾二秉，而實一十斗。下禾八秉，益實一斗與上禾二秉，而實一十斗。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a斗 ，下禾一秉實 b斗 。

Suppose there are two types of grain: upper grain (上禾) and lower grain (下禾). 
- Seven bundles (秉) of upper grain lose 1 dou of grain, but when 2 bundles of lower grain are added, the total becomes 10 dou.
- Eight bundles of lower grain gain 1 dou of grain, but when 2 bundles of upper grain are added, the total becomes 10 dou.

Question: How much grain does one bundle of upper grain (上禾) and one bundle of lower grain (下禾) yield?

Answer: One bundle of upper grain yields *a* dou, and one bundle of lower grain yields *b* dou.

from fractions import Fraction

# Let x = yield of one bundle of upper grain (上禾)
# Let y = yield of one bundle of lower grain (下禾)

# Equation 1: 7x - 1 + 2y = 10
# Simplify: 7x + 2y = 11

# Equation 2: 8y + 1 + 2x = 10
# Simplify: 2x + 8y = 9

# Solve the system of equations:
# From Equation 1: x = (11 - 2y) / 7
# Substitute x into Equation 2:
# 2((11 - 2y) / 7) + 8y = 9
# Multiply through by 7 to eliminate the fraction:
# 2(11 - 2y) + 56y = 63
# 22 - 4y + 56y = 63
# 52y = 41
# y = 41 / 52

# Substitute y back into Equation 1 to solve for x:
# 7x + 2(41 / 52) = 11
# 7x + 82 / 52 = 11
# 7x = 11 - 82 / 52
# 7x = (572 - 82) / 52
# 7x = 490 / 52
# x = 490 / (7 * 52)
# x = 70 / 52
# x = 35 / 26

# Final results:
a = Fraction(35, 26)  # Yield of one bundle of upper grain (上禾)
b = Fraction(41, 52)  # Yield of one bundle of lower grain (下禾)

# Results:
# a = 35/26 dou
# b = 41/52 dou
