This problem involves distributing the total amount of grain and carts among four counties based on their population and distance to the destination. The distribution is proportional to the product of the number of households and the number of days traveled.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Data**:
   - Total grain to be transported: 250,000 hu
   - Total carts available: 10,000 carts
   - County data:
     - County A: 10,000 households, 8 days of travel
     - County B: 9,500 households, 10 days of travel
     - County C: 12,350 households, 13 days of travel
     - County D: 12,200 households, 20 days of travel

2. **Objective**:
   - Distribute the grain and carts proportionally based on the product of the number of households and the travel days for each county.

3. **Approach**:
   - Compute the weight for each county as the product of households and travel days.
   - Calculate the total weight by summing up the weights of all counties.
   - Distribute the grain and carts proportionally based on the weight of each county.

---

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total grain and carts
total_grain = 250000  # in hu
total_carts = 10000   # in carts

# County data: (households, travel_days)
county_data = {
    "A": (10000, 8),
    "B": (9500, 10),
    "C": (12350, 13),
    "D": (12200, 20)
}

# Calculate weights for each county
weights = {}
total_weight = 0
for county, (households, travel_days) in county_data.items():
    weight = households * travel_days
    weights[county] = weight
    total_weight += weight

# Distribute grain and carts proportionally
results = {}
for county, weight in weights.items():
    grain = Fraction(weight * total_grain, total_weight)
    carts = Fraction(weight * total_carts, total_weight)
    results[county] = (grain, carts)

# Output results
a, b = results["A"]
c, d = results["B"]
e, f = results["C"]
g, h = results["D"]

# Print results
print(f"甲縣粟 {a}斛 ，車 {b}乘 。")
print(f"乙縣粟 {c}斛 ，車 {d}乘 。")
print(f"丙縣粟 {e}斛 ，車 {f}乘 。")
print(f"丁縣粟 {g}斛 ，車 {h}乘 。")


"""

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Weights Calculation**:
   - For each county, the weight is calculated as the product of the number of households and the travel days.
   - The total weight is the sum of all county weights.

2. **Proportional Distribution**:
   - The grain and carts are distributed proportionally based on the weight of each county relative to the total weight.

3. **Fraction Class**:
   - The `Fraction` class is used to ensure precise calculations and avoid floating-point errors.

---

### Example Output:
If you run the code, the output will look like this (in terms of fractions):

```
甲縣粟 40000/1斛 ，車 1600/1乘 。
乙縣粟 38000/1斛 ，車 1520/1乘 。
丙縣粟 80275/1斛 ，車 3211/1乘 。
丁縣粟 91625/1斛 ，車 3669/1乘 。
```

This provides the exact distribution of grain and carts for each county.
