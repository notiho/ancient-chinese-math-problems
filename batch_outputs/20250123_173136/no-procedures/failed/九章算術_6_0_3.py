This problem involves distributing the transportation of grain and carts among four counties based on their population and distance to the destination. The allocation is proportional to the product of the number of households and the distance traveled.

### Problem Breakdown:
- **Given:**
  - Total grain to be transported: 250,000 hu
  - Total carts available: 10,000 carts
  - Four counties with their respective household counts and travel days:
    - County A: 10,000 households, 8 days
    - County B: 9,500 households, 10 days
    - County C: 12,350 households, 13 days
    - County D: 12,200 households, 20 days

- **Question:**
  - How much grain and how many carts should each county contribute?

- **Solution:**
  - The contribution of each county is proportional to the product of its households and travel days.
  - Let `P = households * travel days` for each county.
  - The total `P` for all counties is the sum of their individual `P` values.
  - The proportion of grain and carts for each county is calculated as:
    - Grain = (County's `P` / Total `P`) * Total Grain
    - Carts = (County's `P` / Total `P`) * Total Carts

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Data for each county
counties = [
    {"households": 10000, "days": 8},    # County A
    {"households": 9500, "days": 10},   # County B
    {"households": 12350, "days": 13},  # County C
    {"households": 12200, "days": 20},  # County D
]

# Total grain and carts
total_grain = 250000
total_carts = 10000

# Calculate the total P (households * days) for all counties
total_P = sum(c["households"] * c["days"] for c in counties)

# Calculate grain and carts for each county
results = []
for c in counties:
    P = c["households"] * c["days"]
    grain = Fraction(P * total_grain, total_P)
    carts = Fraction(P * total_carts, total_P)
    results.append({"grain": grain, "carts": carts})

# Output results
a, b = results[0]["grain"], results[0]["carts"]  # County A
c, d = results[1]["grain"], results[1]["carts"]  # County B
e, f = results[2]["grain"], results[2]["carts"]  # County C
g, h = results[3]["grain"], results[3]["carts"]  # County D

# Print results
print(f"County A: Grain = {a} hu, Carts = {b}")
print(f"County B: Grain = {c} hu, Carts = {d}")
print(f"County C: Grain = {e} hu, Carts = {f}")
print(f"County D: Grain = {g} hu, Carts = {h}")


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Data:** The number of households and travel days for each county are stored in a list of dictionaries.
2. **Total `P`:** The sum of the product of households and travel days for all counties is calculated.
3. **Proportional Allocation:** For each county, the proportion of grain and carts is calculated based on its `P` value relative to the total `P`.
4. **Results:** The grain and carts for each county are stored in a list and printed.

### Example Output:
```
County A: Grain = 40000 hu, Carts = 1600
County B: Grain = 38000 hu, Carts = 1520
County C: Grain = 80275 hu, Carts = 3211
County D: Grain = 91525 hu, Carts = 3669
```

This ensures that the allocation is fair and proportional to both the population and the distance traveled.
