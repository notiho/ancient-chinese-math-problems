今有上禾五秉，損實一斗一升，當下禾七秉。上禾七秉，損實二斗五升，當下禾五秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
荅曰：上禾一秉 a升 ，下禾一秉 b升 。

Suppose there are two types of grain: "upper grain" (上禾) and "lower grain" (下禾).

- 5 bundles of upper grain lose 1 dou and 1 sheng of grain, equivalent to 7 bundles of lower grain.
- 7 bundles of upper grain lose 2 dou and 5 sheng of grain, equivalent to 5 bundles of lower grain.

Question: How much grain does one bundle of upper grain and one bundle of lower grain yield?

Answer: One bundle of upper grain yields *a* sheng, and one bundle of lower grain yields *b* sheng.
