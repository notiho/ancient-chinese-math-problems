This is a classic ancient Chinese mathematical problem involving the calculation of the dimensions of a square granary and a circular pit based on the given volume of grain. Let's break it down step by step and solve it using Python.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given:**
   - Total grain volume: `23120斛 7斗 3升`
   - The square granary and the circular pit must each hold half of the total grain volume.
   - The height (or depth) of both the granary and the pit is the same.
   - The side length of the square granary is 9 cun (0.9 chi) less than the diameter of the circular pit.
   - The side length of the square granary is 2丈 9尺 8寸 (29.8 chi) greater than the height (or depth).
   - The relationship between the circumference and diameter of the circle is given as \( \pi \approx \frac{22}{7} \).

2. **Unknowns:**
   - Side length of the square granary (`a` 丈).
   - Diameter of the circular pit (`b` 丈).
   - Height (or depth) of both (`c` 丈).

3. **Approach:**
   - Convert the total grain volume into a consistent unit (e.g., cubic chi).
   - Use the relationships between the dimensions to set up equations.
   - Solve for the unknowns.

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total grain volume in consistent units (convert to cubic chi)
# 1 斛 = 10 斗, 1 斗 = 10 升, 1 升 = 1 cubic chi
grain_volume = 23120 * 100 + 7 * 10 + 3  # Total in cubic chi

# Each container holds half of the total grain volume
volume_per_container = Fraction(grain_volume, 2)

# Relationships:
# Let the side length of the square granary be `a` (in chi),
# the diameter of the circular pit be `b` (in chi),
# and the height (or depth) of both be `c` (in chi).

# 1. a = b - 0.9 (side length of square granary is 9 cun less than the diameter of the pit)
# 2. a = c + 29.8 (side length of square granary is 29.8 chi greater than the height)
# 3. Volume of square granary: a^2 * c = volume_per_container
# 4. Volume of circular pit: (π * (b/2)^2) * c = volume_per_container, where π = 22/7

# Solve step by step:

# Step 1: Express `a` in terms of `b` and `c`
# From equation (1): a = b - 0.9
# From equation (2): a = c + 29.8
# Therefore, b - 0.9 = c + 29.8
# => c = b - 30.7

# Step 2: Substitute `a` and `c` into the volume equations
# Square granary: a^2 * c = volume_per_container
# => (b - 0.9)^2 * (b - 30.7) = volume_per_container

# Circular pit: (π * (b/2)^2) * c = volume_per_container
# => (22/7 * (b/2)^2) * (b - 30.7) = volume_per_container

# Step 3: Solve for `b` (diameter of the circular pit)
# Simplify the circular pit equation:
# (22/7 * (b^2 / 4)) * (b - 30.7) = volume_per_container
# => (22/28) * b^2 * (b - 30.7) = volume_per_container
# => (11/14) * b^3 - (11/14) * 30.7 * b^2 = volume_per_container

# Step 4: Solve for `b` numerically (approximation)
# For simplicity, let's approximate the solution numerically.

# Approximate solution:
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
b = sp.Symbol('b')  # Diameter of the circular pit

# Equation for the circular pit
circular_pit_eq = (11/14) * b**3 - (11/14) * 30.7 * b**2 - volume_per_container

# Solve for `b`
b_solution = sp.solve(circular_pit_eq, b)
b_value = max([sol.evalf() for sol in b_solution if sol.is_real and sol > 0])  # Take the positive real solution

# Step 5: Calculate `a` and `c`
a_value = b_value - 0.9  # Side length of the square granary
c_value = b_value - 30.7  # Height (or depth)

# Convert results to zhang (丈)
a_zhang = a_value / 10
b_zhang = b_value / 10
c_zhang = c_value / 10

# Output results
a_zhang, b_zhang, c_zhang

### Explanation of the Code:
1. The total grain volume is converted into cubic chi for consistency.
2. The relationships between the dimensions are used to set up equations.
3. The equations are solved symbolically using SymPy to find the diameter of the circular pit (`b`).
4. The side length of the square granary (`a`) and the height/depth (`c`) are calculated based on the relationships.
5. The results are converted into zhang (丈) for the final answer.

---

### Final Answer:
- Square granary side length: `a` 丈
- Circular pit diameter: `b` 丈
- Height (or depth): `c` 丈

The exact numerical values will be computed when the code is executed.
