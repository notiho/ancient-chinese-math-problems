This is a complex ancient Chinese math problem involving the calculation of the volume of a trapezoidal pool and the labor required to transport the soil. Let's break it into parts and solve step by step.

---

### Part 1: Calculate the volume of the pool
The pool has a trapezoidal shape, so its volume can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a trapezoidal prism:

\[
V = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (上廣 + 下廣) \cdot (袤) \cdot (深)
\]

#### Given:
- 上廣 (top width) = 6 丈
- 下廣 (bottom width) = 4 丈
- 上袤 (top length) = 8 丈
- 下袤 (bottom length) = 6 丈
- 深 (depth) = 2 丈

1 丈 = 10 尺 (convert all measurements to 尺).

---

### Part 2: Labor and soil transport
The problem describes the process of transporting the soil, including distances, adjustments for slopes, and the capacity of the soil baskets. We will calculate the total labor required based on the given parameters.

---

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Part 1: Calculate the volume of the pool
# Convert all measurements to chi (尺)
top_width = 6 * 10  # 上廣
bottom_width = 4 * 10  # 下廣
top_length = 8 * 10  # 上袤
bottom_length = 6 * 10  # 下袤
depth = 2 * 10  # 深

# Average length (袤)
average_length = Fraction(top_length + bottom_length, 2)

# Average width (廣)
average_width = Fraction(top_width + bottom_width, 2)

# Volume of the pool (積)
volume = average_width * average_length * depth

# Convert volume to chi (尺)
volume_chi = volume

# Part 2: Labor and soil transport
# Given parameters
round_trip_distance = 140  # 定一返一百四十步
basket_capacity = Fraction(1, 6)  # 土籠積一尺六寸 = 1.6 尺 = 8/5 尺
distance_per_person_per_day = Fraction(59.5, 1)  # 秋程人功行五十九里半 = 59.5 里

# Calculate total trips required
total_trips = Fraction(volume_chi, basket_capacity)

# Calculate total distance traveled
total_distance = total_trips * round_trip_distance

# Calculate total labor required
total_labor = Fraction(total_distance, distance_per_person_per_day)

# Results
a = total_distance  # Total distance traveled (人到)
b = total_labor  # Total labor required (用徒)

# Print results
print(f"Volume of the pool: {volume_chi} 尺")
print(f"Total distance traveled (人到): {a} 里")
print(f"Total labor required (用徒): {b} 人")


"""


---

### Explanation of Results:
1. **Volume of the pool**: The total volume of the pool is calculated in chi (尺).
2. **Total distance traveled (人到)**: This is the total distance that all workers combined will travel to transport the soil.
3. **Total labor required (用徒)**: This is the number of workers required to complete the task.
