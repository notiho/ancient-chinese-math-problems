今有池，五渠注之。其一渠開之，少半日一滿；次，一日一滿；次，二日半一滿；次，三日一滿；次，五日一滿。今皆決之，問︰幾何日滿池？
荅曰： a日 。

Suppose there is a pool, and five channels are used to fill it. 
The first channel alone fills the pool in half a day, 
the second channel alone fills the pool in 1 day, 
the third channel alone fills the pool in 2.5 days, 
the fourth channel alone fills the pool in 3 days, 
and the fifth channel alone fills the pool in 5 days. 

If all channels are opened together, how many days will it take to fill the pool?

Answer: *a* days.
