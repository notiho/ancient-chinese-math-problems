Suppose there is an upright tree. A rope is tied to the top of the tree, and the other end of the rope touches the ground 3 chi away from the base of the tree. 
When the rope is pulled tight and the person walks away, they are 8 chi away from the base of the tree when the rope is fully extended.
Question: how long is the rope?

Answer: the rope is *a* zhang.
"""

# Given values
base_distance = 3  # chi (distance from the base of the tree to where the rope touches the ground)
walk_distance = 8  # chi (distance the person walks away from the base of the tree)

# Use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the rope length
# Rope length = sqrt(base_distance^2 + walk_distance^2)
rope_length = Fraction(base_distance**2 + walk_distance**2).sqrt()

# Convert chi to zhang (1 zhang = 10 chi)
a = rope_length / 10
