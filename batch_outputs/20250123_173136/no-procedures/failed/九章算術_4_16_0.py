Suppose there is an area of 1518 and 3/4 bu² (square bu). It is desired to find the circumference of the circle with this area.
Question: what is the circumference?

Answer: The circumference is *a* bu.

from fractions import Fraction

# Given area
積 = 1518 + Fraction(3, 4)  # 1518 and 3/4 bu²

# Formula for the area of a circle: A = (C^2) / (4 * π)
# Rearrange to find the circumference: C = sqrt(A * 4 * π)

# Using π ≈ 3 (as in ancient Chinese mathematics)
π = 3

# Circumference formula
a = Fraction(4 * 積 * π).sqrt()

# Output the result
a
