Suppose there are 10 families (甲, 乙, 丙, 丁, 戊, 己, 庚, 辛, 壬, 癸) who collectively pay 1000 hu of rent.  
The rent is distributed as follows:  
甲 pays 35 hu, 乙 pays 46 hu, 丙 pays 57 hu, 丁 pays 68 hu, 戊 pays 79 hu, 己 pays 80 hu, 庚 pays 100 hu, 辛 pays 210 hu, and 壬 pays 325 hu.  
Additionally, there is a transportation fee of 200 hu that must be distributed proportionally among the families based on their rent contributions.  

Question: How much does each family pay in total (including transportation fees)?  

Answer:  
甲 pays *a* hu, 乙 pays *b* hu, 丙 pays *c* hu, 丁 pays *d* hu, 戊 pays *e* hu, 己 pays *f* hu, 庚 pays *g* hu, 辛 pays *h* hu, 壬 pays *i* hu.
