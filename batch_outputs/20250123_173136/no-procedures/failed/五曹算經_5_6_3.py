Suppose there is expensive silk, where 1 liang costs 56 wen, and cheap silk, where 1 liang costs 42 wen. 
There is a total of 131,810 wen available (equivalent to 131 guan and 810 wen). 
Question: how much of each type of silk can be purchased?

Answer: each type of silk is *a* jin.

# 貴絲一两直錢五十六文
貴絲價格 = 56  # wen per liang

# 賤絲一两直錢四十二文
賤絲價格 = 42  # wen per liang

# 總錢一百三十一貫八百一十文
總錢 = 131 * 1000 + 810  # convert guan to wen

# Let x be the amount of expensive silk (in liang) and y be the amount of cheap silk (in liang).
# The total cost equation is:
# 56x + 42y = 131810
# The total weight equation is:
# x + y = total_weight (in liang)

# To simplify, assume the total weight is in jin (1 jin = 16 liang).
# Let total_weight = a jin.
total_weight = Fraction(131810, (56 + 42))  # Total weight in liang

# Convert total weight to jin
a = Fraction(total_weight, 16)  # Convert from liang to jin
