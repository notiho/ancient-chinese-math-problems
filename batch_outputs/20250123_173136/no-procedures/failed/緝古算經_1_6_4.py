This problem involves calculating the dimensions of a trapezoidal granary and the remaining depth of millet after some has been removed. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Granary Dimensions**:
   - The top square side is smaller than the bottom square side by 6 chi.
   - The height of the granary is 9 chi more than the top square side.
   - The granary can hold 187 **shi** and 2 **dou** of millet.

2. **Millet Removed**:
   - 50 **shi** and 4 **dou** of millet have been removed.

3. **Questions**:
   - What are the dimensions of the granary (top side, bottom side, and height)?
   - What is the remaining depth of millet in the granary?

---

### Assumptions:
- The granary is a frustum of a square pyramid.
- Volume formula for a frustum of a square pyramid:
  \[
  V = \frac{h}{3} \times (a^2 + ab + b^2)
  \]
  Where:
  - \( h \) is the height of the granary.
  - \( a \) is the side length of the top square.
  - \( b \) is the side length of the bottom square.

- 1 **shi** = 10 **dou**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total volume of the granary in dou (convert shi to dou)
total_volume_dou = 187 * 10 + 2  # 187 shi and 2 dou

# Millet removed in dou
removed_volume_dou = 50 * 10 + 4  # 50 shi and 4 dou

# Remaining millet in dou
remaining_volume_dou = total_volume_dou - removed_volume_dou

# Let the top side length of the granary be 'a' chi
# Bottom side length of the granary is 'b' chi, where b = a + 6
# Height of the granary is 'h' chi, where h = a + 9

# Volume formula for a frustum of a square pyramid:
# V = (h / 3) * (a^2 + a*b + b^2)
# Substitute b = a + 6 and h = a + 9 into the formula:
# V = ((a + 9) / 3) * (a^2 + a*(a + 6) + (a + 6)^2)

# Simplify the formula:
# V = ((a + 9) / 3) * (a^2 + a^2 + 6a + a^2 + 12a + 36)
# V = ((a + 9) / 3) * (3a^2 + 18a + 36)
# V = (a + 9) * (a^2 + 6a + 12)

# Solve for 'a' such that V = total_volume_dou
# (a + 9) * (a^2 + 6a + 12) = total_volume_dou

# Brute force to find 'a' (top side length)
for a in range(1, 100):  # Assume reasonable range for 'a'
    b = a + 6  # Bottom side length
    h = a + 9  # Height
    volume = (h / 3) * (a**2 + a * b + b**2)
    if volume == total_volume_dou:
        top_side = a
        bottom_side = b
        height = h
        break

# Remaining depth of millet:
# Remaining volume = (remaining_depth / h) * total_volume
remaining_depth = (remaining_volume_dou / total_volume_dou) * height

# Results
top_side = Fraction(top_side)
bottom_side = Fraction(bottom_side)
height = Fraction(height)
remaining_depth = Fraction(remaining_depth)

print(f"Top side (a): {top_side} chi")
print(f"Bottom side (b): {bottom_side} chi")
print(f"Height (c): {height} chi")
print(f"Remaining depth of millet (d): {remaining_depth} chi")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Volume Calculation**:
   - The formula for the volume of a frustum of a square pyramid is used.
   - Substitutions are made for the relationships between the top side, bottom side, and height.

2. **Brute Force**:
   - Since the equation is cubic, solving it algebraically is complex. A brute-force approach is used to find the top side length \( a \).

3. **Remaining Depth**:
   - The remaining depth of millet is proportional to the remaining volume relative to the total volume.

---

### Final Answer:
- Top side (\( a \)): *a* chi.
- Bottom side (\( b \)): *b* chi.
- Height (\( c \)): *c* zhang.
- Remaining depth of millet (\( d \)): *d* chi.
