Suppose there is a square city (yi) of unknown size, with gates at the center of each side.
From the north gate, walking 30 bu, there is a tree. From the west gate, walking 750 bu, there is another tree.
Question: What is the side length of the square city?

Answer: The side length of the city is *a* li.
"""

# Define the distances
北門距離 = 30  # Distance from the north gate to the tree in bu
西門距離 = 750  # Distance from the west gate to the tree in bu

# The diagonal of the square city is the hypotenuse of a right triangle
# formed by the distances from the gates to the trees.
# Diagonal = 北門距離 + 西門距離

# Use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the side length of the square city
# Diagonal = sqrt(2) * side_length
# side_length = Diagonal / sqrt(2)

# Calculate the diagonal
對角線 = 北門距離 + 西門距離

# Calculate the side length in bu
邑方 = Fraction(對角線, 2**0.5)

# Convert the side length from bu to li (1 li = 300 bu)
a = Fraction(邑方, 300)  # Side length in li
