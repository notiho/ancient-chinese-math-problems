Suppose there is a right triangle where the product of the leg (gu) and the hypotenuse (xian) is 1337 and 1/20 (i.e., 1337 + 1/20). The hypotenuse (xian) is longer than the other leg (gu) by 1 and 1/10 (i.e., 1 + 1/10). 
Question: What is the length of the shorter leg (gu)?

Answer: *a*.

# Given values
product = Fraction(1337, 1) + Fraction(1, 20)  # The product of gu and xian
difference = Fraction(1, 1) + Fraction(1, 10)  # The difference between xian and gu

# Let gu = x, and xian = x + difference
# The product of gu and xian is given as:
# x * (x + difference) = product
# Solve for x (gu)

# Expand the equation: x^2 + difference * x = product
# Rearrange: x^2 + difference * x - product = 0

# Coefficients of the quadratic equation
a_coeff = 1
b_coeff = difference

# Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
# x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

# Calculate the discriminant
discriminant = b_coeff**2 - 4 * a_coeff * c_coeff

# Since the discriminant is positive, we take the positive root
gu = (-b_coeff + discriminant**0.5) / (2 * a_coeff)
