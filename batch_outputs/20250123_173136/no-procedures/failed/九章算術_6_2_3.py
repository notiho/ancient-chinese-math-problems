This is a classic problem of proportional distribution based on cost (labor and transportation). The goal is to distribute the total amount of grain (10,000 hu) among the five counties such that the labor and transportation costs are equalized.

To solve this, we need to calculate the cost per hu for each county, including the transportation cost, and then distribute the grain inversely proportional to these costs.

---

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Given Data**:
   - **Counties**: 甲, 乙, 丙, 丁, 戊
   - **Households**: 甲: 20520, 乙: 12312, 丙: 7182, 丁: 13338, 戊: 5130
   - **Grain cost per hu**: 甲: 120 qian, 乙: 110 qian, 丙: 112 qian, 丁: 117 qian, 戊: 113 qian
   - **Distance to transport grain**: 甲: 0 li, 乙: 200 li, 丙: 150 li, 丁: 250 li, 戊: 150 li
   - **Transport cost**: 1 qian per li per cart (1 cart = 25 hu)
   - **Total grain to distribute**: 10,000 hu

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Total cost per hu for each county = grain cost + transportation cost.
   - Transportation cost per hu = (distance × transport cost per cart) ÷ cart capacity.

3. **Equalizing Labor**:
   - Distribute the grain inversely proportional to the total cost per hu for each county.

### Python Code Solution:

# Data for each county
counties = [

# Step 4: Output results

# Display results
for county, grain in results.items():
    print(f"{county}縣得 {grain} 斛")

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Input Data**:
   - Each county's data includes the number of households, grain cost per hu, and distance to the transport location.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each county, the total cost per hu is calculated as the sum of the grain cost and the transportation cost.

3. **Inverse Proportional Distribution**:
   - The grain is distributed inversely proportional to the total cost per hu for each county. This ensures that counties with higher costs receive less grain, balancing the labor and transportation effort.

4. **Results**:
   - The grain share for each county is calculated and displayed.

---

### Example Output:

Assuming the calculations are correct, the output will look something like this:

```
甲縣得 2500 斛
乙縣得 2000 斛
丙縣得 1500 斛
丁縣得 3000 斛
戊縣得 1000 斛
```

(Note: The exact numbers depend on the detailed calculations, which are handled by the code.)
