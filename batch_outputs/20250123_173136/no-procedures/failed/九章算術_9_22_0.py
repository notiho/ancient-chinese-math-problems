There is a mountain and a tree to its west, but the height of the mountain is unknown. The distance between the mountain and the tree is 53 li. The tree is 9 zhang 5 chi tall. A person stands 3 li east of the tree and observes the top of the tree and the mountain peak aligned in a straight line. The person's eye level is 7 chi above the ground. 

Question: What is the height of the mountain?

Answer: The mountain is *a* zhang tall.
