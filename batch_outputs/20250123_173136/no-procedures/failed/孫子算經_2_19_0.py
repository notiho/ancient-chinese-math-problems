Suppose there is a total area of 35,000 square bu. It is desired to find the diameter of a circle with this area.
Question: what is the diameter of the circle?

Answer: the diameter is *a* bu.

# Given area
積 = 35000

# Formula for the area of a circle: A = (π/4) * d^2
# Rearranging for diameter (d): d = sqrt((4 * A) / π)

π = 3

# Calculate the diameter
a = Fraction(4 * 積, π) ** Fraction(1, 2)  # Square root of (4 * 積 / π)
