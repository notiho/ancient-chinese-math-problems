今有竹九節，下三節容四升，上四節容三升。問︰中間二節欲均容各多少？
荅曰：下初， a升 ，次 b升 ，次 c升 ，次 d升 ，次 e升 ，次 f升 ，次 g升 ，次 h升 ，次 i升 。

Suppose there is a bamboo with 9 nodes. The bottom 3 nodes can hold 4 sheng each, and the top 4 nodes can hold 3 sheng each.
Question: how much should the middle 2 nodes hold if the capacity is evenly distributed across all 9 nodes?

Answer: The capacities of the 9 nodes are:
Bottom 3 nodes: *a*, *b*, *c* sheng.
Middle 2 nodes: *d*, *e* sheng.
Top 4 nodes: *f*, *g*, *h*, *i* sheng.
"""

# Total capacity of the bamboo
bottom_capacity = 3 * 4  # Bottom 3 nodes, each 4 sheng
top_capacity = 4 * 3     # Top 4 nodes, each 3 sheng
total_capacity = bottom_capacity + top_capacity

# Remaining capacity for the middle 2 nodes
middle_capacity = total_capacity - (bottom_capacity + top_capacity)

# Evenly distribute the middle capacity across the 2 middle nodes
middle_node_capacity = Fraction(middle_capacity, 2)

# Assign capacities to each node
a = b = c = 4  # Bottom 3 nodes
d = e = middle_node_capacity  # Middle 2 nodes
f = g = h = i = 3  # Top 4 nodes

# Output the results
a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i
