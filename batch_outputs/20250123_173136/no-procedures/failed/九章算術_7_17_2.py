Suppose there are 9 pieces of gold and 11 pieces of silver, and their total weight is equal. 
If one piece of gold is exchanged for one piece of silver, the gold becomes lighter by 13 liang.
Question: how much does one piece of gold and one piece of silver weigh?

Answer: one piece of gold weighs *a* jin, and one piece of silver weighs *b* jin.
"""

# Let the weight of one piece of gold be `x` jin and one piece of silver be `y` jin.
# Total weight of gold = 9x
# Total weight of silver = 11y
# When one piece of gold is exchanged for one piece of silver, the weight difference is 13 liang (1 jin = 16 liang).

# Equation 1: 9x = 11y (total weights are equal)
# Equation 2: x - y = 13 / 16 (difference in weight after exchange)

from fractions import Fraction

# Solve the equations
# From Equation 1: x = (11/9) * y
# Substitute into Equation 2: (11/9) * y - y = 13 / 16
# Simplify: (11y - 9y) / 9 = 13 / 16
# 2y / 9 = 13 / 16
# y = (13 / 16) * (9 / 2)

y = Fraction(13, 16) * Fraction(9, 2)

# Substitute y into x = (11/9) * y
x = Fraction(11, 9) * y

# Results
a = x  # weight of one piece of gold in jin
b = y  # weight of one piece of silver in jin

a, b
