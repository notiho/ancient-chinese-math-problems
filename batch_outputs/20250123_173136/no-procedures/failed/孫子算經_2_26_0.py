今有人盜庫絹，不知所失幾何？但聞草中分絹，人得六匹，盈六匹；人得七匹，不足七匹。問人、絹各幾何？
答曰：賊 a人 ，絹 b匹 。

Suppose someone stole silk from a storehouse, but the exact amount of silk is unknown. 
It is only known that when dividing the silk among the people:
- If each person gets 6 bolts of silk, there are 6 bolts left over.
- If each person gets 7 bolts of silk, there are not enough bolts for everyone.

Question: How many people (a) and how many bolts of silk (b) are there?

Answer: There are *a* people and *b* bolts of silk.
"""

# Solve using the given conditions:
# Let `a` be the number of people and `b` be the total bolts of silk.
# Condition 1: b = 6a + 6 (6 bolts per person, 6 left over)
# Condition 2: b = 7a - r, where r > 0 (7 bolts per person, not enough for everyone)

# We need to find the smallest positive integers `a` and `b` that satisfy both conditions.

from fractions import Fraction

# Initialize variables
a = 0  # number of people
b = 0  # total bolts of silk

# Iterate to find the solution
for people in range(1, 1000):  # Arbitrary range to find the smallest solution
    silk = 6 * people + 6  # From condition 1
    if silk % 7 == 0:  # Check if it satisfies condition 2
        a = people
        b = silk
        break

# Output the result
a, b
