今有上禾三秉，益實六斗，當下禾十秉。下禾五秉，益實一斗，當上禾二秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a斗 ，下禾一秉實 b斗 。

Suppose there are two types of grain, "upper grain" (上禾) and "lower grain" (下禾). 
- 3 bundles of upper grain plus 6 dou of grain are equivalent to 10 bundles of lower grain.
- 5 bundles of lower grain plus 1 dou of grain are equivalent to 2 bundles of upper grain.

Question: How much grain (in dou) does one bundle of upper grain and one bundle of lower grain yield?

Answer: One bundle of upper grain yields *a* dou, and one bundle of lower grain yields *b* dou.

from fractions import Fraction

# Let the yield of one bundle of upper grain be `a` dou
# Let the yield of one bundle of lower grain be `b` dou

# Equation 1: 3a + 6 = 10b
# Equation 2: 5b + 1 = 2a

# Solve for `a` and `b` using substitution or elimination

# From Equation 2: 2a = 5b + 1 => a = (5b + 1) / 2
a = Fraction(5, 2) * b + Fraction(1, 2)

# Substitute `a` into Equation 1:
# 3((5b + 1) / 2) + 6 = 10b
# Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
# 3(5b + 1) + 12 = 20b
# 15b + 3 + 12 = 20b
# 15b + 15 = 20b
# 15 = 5b
# b = 3

b = Fraction(3)

# Substitute `b` back into the expression for `a`:
# a = (5(3) + 1) / 2
# a = (15 + 1) / 2
# a = 16 / 2
# a = 8

a = Fraction(8)

# Final results:
# a = 8 dou (upper grain yield per bundle)
# b = 3 dou (lower grain yield per bundle)
