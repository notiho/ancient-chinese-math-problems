Suppose there is expensive silk, where 1 liang costs 56 wen, and cheap silk, where 1 liang costs 42 wen. 
There is a total of 131,810 wen available. 
Question: how much of each type of silk can be purchased?

Answer: each type of silk is *a* jin (1 jin = 16 liang).
"""

# 貴絲一两直錢五十六文
貴絲價 = 56  # wen per liang

# 賤絲一两直錢四十二文
賤絲價 = 42  # wen per liang

# 總錢一百三十一貫八百一十文
總錢 = 131 * 1000 + 810  # convert to wen

# Let x be the amount of expensive silk in liang, and y be the amount of cheap silk in liang.
# The total cost equation is:
# 56x + 42y = 131810
# The total weight equation is:
# x + y = total weight in liang

# To simplify, we assume equal weights of expensive and cheap silk:
total_weight = 總錢 / (貴絲價 + 賤絲價)

# Each type of silk gets half the total weight:
a = Fraction(total_weight, 2) / 16  # Convert from liang to jin
