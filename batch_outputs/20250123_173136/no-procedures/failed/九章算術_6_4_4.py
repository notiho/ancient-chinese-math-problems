今有粟七斗，三人分舂之，一人為糲米，一人為粺米，一人為鑿米，令米數等。問︰取粟為米各幾何？
荅曰：糲米取粟 a斗 。粺米取粟 b斗 。鑿米取粟 c斗 。為米各 d斗 。

Suppose there are 7 dou of millet, and three people are tasked with processing it. 
One person makes roughly husked millet (糲米), one makes semi-polished millet (粺米), and one makes fully polished millet (鑿米). 
The resulting amount of millet for each person must be equal.

Question: how much millet does each person take to process, and how much millet does each person produce?

Answer: 
- The person making roughly husked millet takes *a* dou of millet.
- The person making semi-polished millet takes *b* dou of millet.
- The person making fully polished millet takes *c* dou of millet.
- Each person produces *d* dou of millet.
