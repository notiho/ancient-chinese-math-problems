Suppose there are two people who, in three days, smelt copper and obtain 1 jin, 9 liang, and 5 zhu. 
Now, in one month and three days, the smelted copper is 9876 jin, 5 liang, and 4 zhu, minus half a zhu.
Question: how many people were working?

The procedure says: Place the amount of copper smelted by two people in three days (jin, liang, zhu) and convert it all into zhu.
Divide it by the product of two people and three days to find the amount smelted by one person in one day in zhu.
Convert this back into liang and zhu by dividing by 24.
Then, take the amount smelted by one person in one day (in zhu) and multiply it by the total number of days in one month and three days.
Convert this into a fraction with a denominator of 3 to find the divisor.
Next, convert the total amount of copper smelted in one month and three days (jin, liang, zhu) into zhu, including the adjustment for "minus half a zhu" (which is 1/2 zhu).
Multiply this by 6 to find the dividend.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the number of people.
If the result is not exact, reduce it to a fraction.

Answer: *a* people.
