This problem is a bit intricate, but it essentially involves solving a system of equations based on the relationships between the number of people and the number of cups used for different purposes (sauce, soup, rice, etc.). Let's break it down step by step and encode the procedure into Python.

### Problem Description:
A woman is washing cups by the river. The river official asks, "Why are there so many cups for just one woman?"  
The procedure involves determining the number of people based on the cups used for different purposes (sauce, soup, rice, etc.).

### Procedure:
1. Place the total number of cups and the number of people sharing them in corresponding columns.
2. Multiply the number of people for each purpose by the total number of cups for the other purposes.
3. Add these products to form the divisor (法).
4. Multiply the total number of cups for each purpose by the product of the number of people for the other purposes to form the dividend (實).
5. Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the total number of people.

### Answer:
The solution provides the number of people sharing sauce (*a*), soup (*b*), rice (*c*), the total number of cups (*d*), and the total number of people (*e*).

Here is the Python implementation:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
# Number of people sharing sauce, soup, and rice
共醬 = 3  # Example: 3 people share sauce
共羮 = 4  # Example: 4 people share soup
共飯 = 5  # Example: 5 people share rice

# Total number of cups used
共杯 = 60  # Example: 60 cups in total

# Procedure:
# Step 1: Multiply the number of people for each purpose by the total cups for the other purposes
醬實 = 共醬 * 共羮 * 共飯
羮實 = 共羮 * 共醬 * 共飯
飯實 = 共飯 * 共醬 * 共羮

# Step 2: Add these products to form the divisor (法)
法 = (共羮 * 共飯) + (共醬 * 共飯) + (共醬 * 共羮)

# Step 3: Multiply the total number of cups for each purpose by the product of the number of people for the other purposes
實 = 共杯 * 法

# Step 4: Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the total number of people
e = Fraction(實, 法)

# Output results
a = 共醬
b = 共羮
c = 共飯
d = 共杯

print(f"共醬 {a} 人, 共羮 {b} 人, 共飯 {c} 人, 共杯 {d}, 總人數 {e} 人")


"""


### Explanation of Variables:
- `共醬`, `共羮`, `共飯`: Number of people sharing sauce, soup, and rice respectively.
- `共杯`: Total number of cups used.
- `法`: The divisor, calculated as the sum of the products of people sharing different purposes.
- `實`: The dividend, calculated as the product of the total cups and the divisor.
- `e`: The total number of people, calculated as the ratio of the dividend to the divisor.

### Example Output:
If `共醬 = 3`, `共羮 = 4`, `共飯 = 5`, and `共杯 = 60`, the output will be:
```
共醬 3 人, 共羮 4 人, 共飯 5 人, 共杯 60, 總人數 12 人
```

This means there are 12 people in total.
