Suppose there are 5463 guan and 450 wen of money. According to the rule, for every guan, 50 wen are deducted as a fee.
Question: how much is deducted in total?

The procedure says: First, take the total money and halve it. Then, shift the decimal place (divide by 10). The result is obtained.

Answer: *a* guan.
