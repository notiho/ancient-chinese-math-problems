"""
This problem is a classic Chinese mathematical problem, often referred to as the "Hundred Chickens Problem." The goal is to determine how many roosters (雞翁), hens (雞母), and chicks (雞雛) can be purchased with 100 coins, such that the total number of chickens is 100.

The problem involves solving a system of equations:
1. \( 5a + 3c + \frac{1}{3}e = 100 \) (total cost in coins)
2. \( a + c + e = 100 \) (total number of chickens)

Where:
- \( a \): number of roosters (雞翁), each costing 5 coins.
- \( c \): number of hens (雞母), each costing 3 coins.
- \( e \): number of chicks (雞雛), 3 chicks cost 1 coin.

The solution requires integer values for \( a \), \( c \), and \( e \).

### Procedure
The procedure provided in the text suggests a systematic way to solve the problem by iteratively adjusting the counts of roosters, hens, and chicks while ensuring the constraints are satisfied.

Here is the Python implementation:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Initialize the total money and total chickens
total_money = 100
total_chickens = 100

# Initialize the cost of each type of chicken
cost_rooster = 5  # 雞翁直錢五
cost_hen = 3      # 雞母直錢三
cost_chick = Fraction(1, 3)  # 雞雛三直錢一

# Store solutions
solutions = []

# Iterate over possible numbers of roosters (雞翁)
for a in range(total_chickens + 1):  # a: number of roosters
    # Iterate over possible numbers of hens (雞母)
    for c in range(total_chickens + 1 - a):  # c: number of hens
        # Calculate the number of chicks (雞雛)
        e = total_chickens - a - c  # e: number of chicks
        
        # Check if the total cost matches the total money
        if (cost_rooster * a + cost_hen * c + cost_chick * e) == total_money:
            # Add the solution to the list
            solutions.append((a, c, e))

# Output the solutions
for solution in solutions:
    a, c, e = solution
    b = cost_rooster * a  # Total cost of roosters
    d = cost_hen * c      # Total cost of hens
    f = cost_chick * e    # Total cost of chicks
    print(f"雞翁 {a} 直錢 {b} 雞母 {c} 直錢 {d} 雞雛 {e} 直錢 {f}")


"""


### Explanation of the Code
1. **Initialization**:
   - `total_money` is set to 100 coins.
   - `total_chickens` is set to 100 chickens.
   - The costs of roosters, hens, and chicks are defined.

2. **Iterative Search**:
   - The outer loop iterates over possible numbers of roosters (`a`).
   - The inner loop iterates over possible numbers of hens (`c`), ensuring the total number of chickens does not exceed 100.
   - The number of chicks (`e`) is calculated as the remainder after accounting for roosters and hens.

3. **Validation**:
   - The total cost is calculated for the current combination of `a`, `c`, and `e`.
   - If the total cost equals 100 coins, the solution is valid and added to the list of solutions.

4. **Output**:
   - Each solution is printed, showing the number and total cost of roosters, hens, and chicks.

### Example Output
```
雞翁 0 直錢 0 雞母 25 直錢 75 雞雛 75 直錢 25
雞翁 4 直錢 20 雞母 18 直錢 54 雞雛 78 直錢 26
雞翁 8 直錢 40 雞母 11 直錢 33 雞雛 81 直錢 27
雞翁 12 直錢 60 雞母 4 直錢 12 雞雛 84 直錢 28
```

Each line represents a valid solution to the problem.
