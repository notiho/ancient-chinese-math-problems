Add the difference to get the side length, height, and depth.\n\nAnswer: The side length (or diameter) is *a* zhang, the height is *b* zhang, and the depth is *c* zhang.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# \u7c9f\u4e09\u5343\u4e03\u5341\u4e8c\u77f3\n\u7c9f = 3072\n\n# Step 1: \u4e09\u5341\u4e94\u4e58\u7c9f\uff0c\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u800c\u4e00\u70ba\u7387\n\u7387 = Fraction(35 * \u7c9f, 25)\n\n# Step 2: \u591a\u81ea\u4e58\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e26\u591a\u5c11\u4e58\u4e4b\n\u591a = 1  # Initial guess for the side length (or diameter)\n\u4e26\u591a\u5c11 = 1  # Initial guess for the height difference\nwhile True:\n    # Step 3: \u4ee5\u4e58\u4e00\u5341\u56db\u5982\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u800c\u4e00\uff0c\u6240\u5f97\u4ee5\u6e1b\u7387\u4f59\u70ba\u5be6\n    \u5be6 = Fraction(14 * \u591a * \u591a * \u4e26\u591a\u5c11, 25) - \u7387\n\n    # Step 4: \u4e26\u591a\u5c11\u4ee5\u4e58\u591a\u500d\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e58\u4e00\u5341\u56db\u5982\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u800c\u4e00\n    \u65b9\u6cd5 = \u591a * \u591a + \u5be6\n    \u5ec9\u6cd5 = \u4e26\u591a\u5c11 * Fraction(14, 25) + \u591a + \u5be6\n\n    # Step 5: \u5f9e\u958b\u7acb\u65b9\u9664\u4e4b\uff0c\u5373\u7a96\u6df1\n    \u7a96\u6df1 = round(\u65b9\u6cd5 ** (1 / 3))\n\n    # Step 6: \u5404\u52a0\u5dee\uff0c\u5373\u65b9\u5f91\u9ad8\n    \u65b9\u5f91 = \u591a\n    \u9ad8 = \u7a96\u6df1 + 3\n    \u6df1 = \u7a96\u6df1\n\n    # Check if the calculations satisfy the constraints\n    if abs(\u9ad8 - \u6df1 - 3) < 1e-6 and abs(\u6df1 - \u9ad8 + 2) < 1e-6:\n        break\n\n    # Update guesses\n    \u591a += 1\n    \u4e26\u591a\u5c11 += 1\n\na = \u65b9\u5f91\nb = \u9ad8\nc = \u6df1\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Input and Initialization**: The total grain volume is given as 3072 shi. Initial guesses for the side length (or diameter) and height difference are set.\n2. **Rate Calculation**: The rate is calculated using the formula provided in the procedure.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: The dimensions are iteratively adjusted until they satisfy the constraints of the problem.\n4. **Output**: The side length (or diameter), height, and depth are calculated and stored in `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively.\n\nThis code follows the ancient procedure step by step, using Python's `Fraction` class to handle fractional calculations accurately.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1901, "completion_tokens": 4031, "total_tokens": 5932, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ec7eab8ec3"}}, "error": null}
