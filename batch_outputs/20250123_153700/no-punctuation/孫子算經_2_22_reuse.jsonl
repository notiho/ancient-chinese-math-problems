Divide each group's total qian by the number of people in that group to find the qian per person.\n\nAnswer: Each person in the 2-part group gets *a* qian, each person in the 3-part group gets *b* qian, and each person in the 4-part group gets *c* qian.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Total qian\n\u9322 = 6930\n\n# People in each group\n\u982d\u4f4d\u4eba\u6578 = 81\n\u4e2d\u4f4d\u4eba\u6578 = 72\n\u4e0b\u4f4d\u4eba\u6578 = 63\n\n# Multipliers for each group\n\u982d\u4f4d\u4e58\u6578 = 2\n\u4e2d\u4f4d\u4e58\u6578 = 3\n\u4e0b\u4f4d\u4e58\u6578 = 4\n\n# Calculate the weighted contributions\n\u982d\u4f4d = \u982d\u4f4d\u4eba\u6578 * \u982d\u4f4d\u4e58\u6578\n\u4e2d\u4f4d = \u4e2d\u4f4d\u4eba\u6578 * \u4e2d\u4f4d\u4e58\u6578\n\u4e0b\u4f4d = \u4e0b\u4f4d\u4eba\u6578 * \u4e0b\u4f4d\u4e58\u6578\n\n# Calculate the divisor (\u6cd5)\n\u6cd5 = \u982d\u4f4d + \u4e2d\u4f4d + \u4e0b\u4f4d\n\n# Calculate the total qian for each group\n\u982d\u4f4d\u7e3d\u9322 = Fraction(\u9322 * \u982d\u4f4d, \u6cd5)\n\u4e2d\u4f4d\u7e3d\u9322 = Fraction(\u9322 * \u4e2d\u4f4d, \u6cd5)\n\u4e0b\u4f4d\u7e3d\u9322 = Fraction(\u9322 * \u4e0b\u4f4d, \u6cd5)\n\n# Calculate the qian per person in each group\na = Fraction(\u982d\u4f4d\u7e3d\u9322, \u982d\u4f4d\u4eba\u6578)\nb = Fraction(\u4e2d\u4f4d\u7e3d\u9322, \u4e2d\u4f4d\u4eba\u6578)\nc = Fraction(\u4e0b\u4f4d\u7e3d\u9322, \u4e0b\u4f4d\u4eba\u6578)", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1992, "completion_tokens": 3382, "total_tokens": 5374, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ec7eab8ec3"}}, "error": null}
