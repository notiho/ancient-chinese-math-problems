This is a complex problem involving the extraction of a cube root for a given volume, expressed as a mixed fraction. The procedure for cube root extraction in ancient Chinese mathematics is detailed and involves iterative approximation. Below is the Python implementation of the procedure:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 積一百九十三萬七千五百四十一尺二十七分尺之一十七
積 = Fraction(1937541) + Fraction(27, 17)

# 開立方術
# 置積為實
實 = 積

# Initialize variables
商 = 0  # 商 (the result of the cube root, initialized to 0)
餘 = 實  # 餘 (remainder, initialized to the volume)

# 開立方術 iterative process
while True:
    # 借一算步之超二等議所得
    借 = 1
    while (商 + 借) ** 3 <= 實:
        借 += 1
    借 -= 1  # Step back to the last valid 借

    # Update 商 (商 += 借)
    商 += 借

    # Update 餘 (餘 = 實 - 商^3)
    餘 = 實 - 商 ** 3

    # Check if 餘 is zero (perfect cube)
    if 餘 == 0:
        break

    # If 餘 is not zero, continue the process
    if 餘 < 0:
        break  # If remainder becomes negative, stop (not a perfect cube)

# The result is 商
a = 商
print(f"荅曰 a = {a} 尺")


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Volume**: The given volume is converted into a `Fraction` to handle the mixed fraction accurately.
2. **Initialization**: The cube root (`商`) is initialized to 0, and the remainder (`餘`) is set to the input volume.
3. **Iterative Cube Root Extraction**:
   - The algorithm iteratively finds the largest possible `借` such that `(商 + 借)^3` does not exceed the volume.
   - Once the largest valid `借` is found, it is added to `商`.
   - The remainder (`餘`) is updated as `實 - 商^3`.
   - If the remainder becomes zero, the process stops, indicating a perfect cube.
4. **Output**: The result (`商`) is the cube root of the given volume.

### Note:
If the volume is not a perfect cube, the algorithm will stop when the remainder becomes negative or cannot be further reduced. In such cases, the cube root cannot be perfectly extracted, and additional steps (like approximations) would be needed.
