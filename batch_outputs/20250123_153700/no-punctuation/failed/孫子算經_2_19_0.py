Suppose there is an area of 35,000 bu. Question: what is the diameter of the circle?

The procedure says: Place the area of 35,000 bu. Multiply it by 12, obtaining 420,000 as the dividend.
Next, borrow one counting rod to serve as the divisor. The divisor starts at 100 and increases by one place value.
The first quotient is placed above the dividend as 600. Place 60,000 (600 squared) below the dividend as the auxiliary value.
Subtract, and the remaining value becomes the new dividend. The divisor is adjusted by one place value, and the process repeats.
Continue this process for the next quotient, 40, and then for the next quotient, 8.
The final result is the diameter of the circle, expressed as 648 bu and 96/1296 bu.

Answer: *a* bu.
