"""
This is a complex ancient Chinese mathematical problem involving the calculation of the dimensions of a square granary and a circular pit based on the given volume of grain. Let's translate the procedure into Python step by step.


"""


"""
Suppose there are 16,348 shi and 8 dou of millet. It is desired to construct a square granary and a circular pit, with equal height and depth.
The square side is 1 zhang less than the circular diameter, and 5 chi more than the height.
The hu method is 2 chi 5 cun, and the ratio of the circumference to the diameter is 22/7.
Question: What are the square side, height/depth, and circular diameter?

The procedure says:
1. Multiply 14 by the hu method, then multiply by the millet volume. Use 89 and 1 as the divisor to get the result.
2. Double the "more" value and add the "less" value. Multiply by the "less" value. Multiply by 33, then divide by 89 and 1 to get the "less" factor.
3. Square the "more" value, add it to the result to get the "method factor."
4. Double the "less" value, multiply by 33, then divide by 89 and 1. Add the "more" value to get the "edge factor."
5. Take the cube root of the result and divide to get the height/depth. Add the difference to get the square side and circular diameter.

Answer: The square side is *a* zhang, the height/depth is *b* zhang, and the circular diameter is *c* zhang.
