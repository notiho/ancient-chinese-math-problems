This problem is a complex ancient Chinese mathematical problem involving cubic equations and geometric reasoning. Translating it into Python code requires careful interpretation of the procedure ("術"). Here's the solution step-by-step:

"""
Suppose there are 26,342 shi and 4 dou of millet, and it is desired to construct six square pits and four circular pits.
The pits are to have small openings at the top and larger bases at the bottom, with the square side length equal to the circular diameter.
The depth is the same for all pits, with the depth being 7 chi less than the bottom side length and 14 chi more than the top side length.
The pits are to be filled completely, and the millet is to be used up exactly.
Question: What are the depths of the top and bottom sides of the pits?

The procedure says:
1. Multiply 42 by the hu divisor (斛法) and then multiply by the millet amount.
2. Divide by 384 to get the cubic chi for the square pits.
3. Let the difference between the top and bottom side lengths be the "差" (difference).
4. Square the difference and multiply by 3, then divide by 1 to get the "隅陽冪" (corner excess).
5. Multiply the corner excess by the larger side length and subtract it from the cubic chi to get the "實" (remainder).
6. Multiply the larger side length by the difference and add the corner excess to get the "方法" (method divisor).
7. Add the larger side length to the difference to get the "廉法" (edge divisor).
8. Solve the cubic equation to find the top side length.
9. Add the difference to the top side length to get the bottom side length.
10. The depth is 7 chi less than the bottom side length.

Answer: The square pit's top side length is *a* chi, the bottom side length is *b* zhang, and the depth is *c* zhang.
The circular pit's dimensions are the same as the square pit.

### Explanation:
1. The procedure involves calculating the cubic volume of the pits and solving for the dimensions based on the given constraints.
2. The difference between the top and bottom side lengths is used to calculate intermediate values like the "隅陽冪" (corner excess) and the "方法" (method divisor).
3. A cubic equation is solved to find the top side length, and the bottom side length and depth are derived from it.
4. The results are expressed in chi and zhang as required.
