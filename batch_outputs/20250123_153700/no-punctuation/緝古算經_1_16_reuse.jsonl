Multiply the given product (mi) by itself, double the excess (difference between hypotenuse and leg), and add 1. This becomes the cubic power (\u7acb\u51aa).\n2. Add the excess again, multiply it by itself, and halve it. Subtract this from the cubic power to get the dividend (\u5be6).\n3. Multiply the excess by itself, double it, and this becomes the divisor (\u65b9\u6cd5).\n4. Place the excess, multiply it by 5, add 2, and this becomes the auxiliary divisor (\u5ec9\u6cd5).\n5. Extract the cube root of the dividend divided by the divisor, and this gives the leg (gu).\n\nThe procedure is complex and redundant. A simplified version is:\n1. Multiply the given product (mi) by the excess (difference between hypotenuse and leg) plus 1, divide by 4 to get the dividend (\u5be6).\n2. The excess becomes the divisor (\u5ec9\u6cd5).\n3.
