Jia then moves diagonally northeast along the city boundary and meets Yi.\nThe ratio of their speeds is such that Jia travels 5 units for every 3 units Yi travels.\nQuestion: How far do Jia and Yi each travel?\n\nThe procedure says:\nLet 5 square itself, and 3 also square itself. Add these and halve the result to obtain the diagonal travel rate.\nSubtract the diagonal travel rate from 5 squared to get the southward travel rate.\nMultiply 3 by 5 to obtain Yi's eastward travel rate.\nTake half the city's side length, multiply it by the southward travel rate, and divide by the eastward travel rate to find the number of steps Jia takes to exit the south gate.\nAdd this to half the city's side length to get Jia's total southward travel.\nTo find the diagonal distance, multiply the southward travel by the diagonal travel rate.\nTo find the eastward distance, multiply the southward travel by the eastward travel rate.\nDivide each result by the southward travel rate to find the respective distances.\n\nAnswer: Jia exits the south gate and travels *a*(=800) steps south, then travels diagonally northeast for *b*(=9775/2) steps to meet Yi. Yi travels *c*(=8625/2) steps east.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# \u57ce\u9091\u65b9\u5341\u91cc\uff0c\u5404\u4e2d\u958b\u9580\n\u9091\u65b9 = 10  # li\n\u9091\u65b9\u534a = Fraction(\u9091\u65b9, 2)  # Half the city's side length\n\n# \u7532\u884c\u4e94\uff0c\u4e59\u884c\u4e09\n\u7532\u901f = 5\n\u4e59\u901f = 3\n\n# \u4ee4\u4e94\u81ea\u4e58\uff0c\u4e09\u4ea6\u81ea\u4e58\uff0c\u5e76\u800c\u534a\u4e4b\uff0c\u70ba\u90aa\u884c\u7387\n\u90aa\u884c\u7387 = Fraction(\u7532\u901f**2 + \u4e59\u901f**2, 2)\n\n# \u90aa\u884c\u7387\u6e1b\u65bc\u4e94\u81ea\u4e58\u8005\uff0c\u9918\uff0c\u70ba\u5357\u884c\u7387\n\u5357\u884c\u7387 = \u7532\u901f**2 - \u90aa\u884c\u7387\n\n# \u4ee5\u4e09\u4e58\u4e94\uff0c\u70ba\u4e59\u6771\u884c\u7387\n\u6771\u884c\u7387 = \u4e59\u901f * \u7532\u901f\n\n# \u7f6e\u9091\u65b9\u534a\u4e4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5357\u884c\u7387\u4e58\u4e4b\uff0c\u5982\u6771\u884c\u7387\u800c\u4e00\uff0c\u5373\u5f97\u51fa\u5357\u9580\u6b65\u6578\n\u51fa\u5357\u9580\u6b65\u6578 = Fraction(\u9091\u65b9\u534a * \u5357\u884c\u7387, \u6771\u884c\u7387)\n\n# \u4ee5\u589e\u9091\u65b9\u534a\uff0c\u5373\u5357\u884c\n\u5357\u884c = \u51fa\u5357\u9580\u6b65\u6578 + \u9091\u65b9\u534a\n\n# \u7f6e\u5357\u884c\u6b65\u6c42\u5f26\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u90aa\u884c\u7387\u4e58\u4e4b\n\u90aa\u884c = Fraction(\u5357\u884c * \u90aa\u884c\u7387, \u5357\u884c\u7387)\n\n# \u6c42\u6771\u8005\u4ee5\u6771\u884c\u7387\u4e58\u4e4b\n\u6771\u884c = Fraction(\u5357\u884c * \u6771\u884c\u7387, \u5357\u884c\u7387)\n\n# \u7b54\u6848\na = \u51fa\u5357\u9580\u6b65\u6578  # 800\nb = \u90aa\u884c  # 9775/2\nc = \u6771\u884c  # 8625/2", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2162, "completion_tokens": 3504, "total_tokens": 5666, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_60a3f2dc65"}}, "error": null}
