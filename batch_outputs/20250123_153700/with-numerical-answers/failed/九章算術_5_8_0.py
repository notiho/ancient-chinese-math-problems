今有塹上廣一丈六尺三寸，下廣一丈，深六尺三寸，袤一十三丈二尺一寸。問︰積幾何？
荅曰：一萬九百四十三尺八寸。
夏程人功八百七十一尺。并出土功五分之一，沙礫水石之功作太半，定功二百三十二尺、一十五分尺之四。問︰用徒幾何？
術曰：置本人功，去其出土功五分之一，又去沙礫水石之功太半，餘為法。以塹積尺為實。實如法而一，即用徒人數。
荅曰： a(=164157/3484)人 。

Suppose there is a trench with the following dimensions:
- Top width: 1 zhang 6 chi 3 cun
- Bottom width: 1 zhang
- Depth: 6 chi 3 cun
- Length: 13 zhang 2 chi 1 cun

Question: What is the volume of the trench?

Answer: 10943 chi 8 cun.

Additionally:
- The standard labor output is 871 chi.
- Include the additional work for removing soil, which is 1/5 of the total.
- The work for gravel, water, and stones is more than half (3/5) of the total.
- The remaining work is 232 chi and 4/15 chi.

Question: How many workers are required?

The procedure says:
- Place the standard labor output and subtract 1/5 for removing soil.
- Subtract 3/5 for gravel, water, and stones.
- The remainder is the divisor.
- Use the trench volume as the dividend.
- Divide the dividend by the divisor to determine the number of workers.

Answer: *a*(=164157/3484) workers.
