今有出錢一千一百二十，買絲一石二鈞十八斤。欲其貴賤斤率之，問︰各幾何？
其率術曰：各置所買石、鈞、斤、兩以為法，以所率乘錢數為實，實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法賤實貴。
荅曰：其 a(=34/15)鈞 ，斤 b(=5)錢 。其 c(=13/12)石 ，斤 d(=6)錢 。

Suppose there is an expenditure of 1120 qian to buy 1 shi, 2 jun, and 18 jin of silk.
It is desired to calculate the price per jin based on the weight. 
Question: what is the price per jin for each unit (shi, jun, jin)?

The procedure says: Place the quantities of shi, jun, jin, and liang as the divisor.
Multiply the total money by the respective rates to obtain the dividend.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to obtain the price per jin.
If the divisor is not fully divisible, subtract the remainder from the divisor. 
The divisor becomes cheaper, and the dividend becomes more expensive.

Answer: The price per jun is *a*(=34/15) qian per jin, and *b*(=5) qian per jin.
The price per shi is *c*(=13/12) qian per jin, and *d*(=6) qian per jin.
