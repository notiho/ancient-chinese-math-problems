今有均輸卒：甲縣一千二百人，薄塞；乙縣一千五百五十人，行道一日；丙縣一千二百八十人，行道二日；丁縣九百九十人，行道三日；戊縣一千七百五十人，行道五日。凡五縣，賦輸卒一月一千二百人。欲以遠近、戶率，多少衰出之。問︰縣各幾何？
術曰：令縣卒，各如其居所及行道日數而一，以為衰。甲衰四，乙衰五，丙衰四，丁衰三，戊衰五，副并為法。以人數乘未并者各自為實。實如法而一。有分者，上下輩之。
荅曰：甲縣 a(=229)人 。乙縣 b(=286)人 。丙縣 c(=228)人 。丁縣 d(=171)人 。戊縣 e(=286)人 。

Suppose there are laborers for equalized transport from five counties:
County A has 1200 people, stationed at the border;
County B has 1550 people, traveling for 1 day;
County C has 1280 people, traveling for 2 days;
County D has 990 people, traveling for 3 days;
County E has 1750 people, traveling for 5 days.
In total, the five counties are to provide 1200 laborers per month.
It is desired to allocate the laborers proportionally based on distance, household rates, and the number of people in each county.

The procedure says: Assign the laborers of each county based on their location and the number of days they travel, treating these as weights.
The weights are: A = 4, B = 5, C = 4, D = 3, E = 5.
Add these weights together to form the divisor.
Multiply the number of people in each county by their respective weights to form the dividends.
Divide each dividend by the divisor to obtain the number of laborers for each county.
If there are fractions, round them up or down appropriately.

Answer: County A provides *a*(=229) people, County B provides *b*(=286) people, County C provides *c*(=228) people, County D provides *d*(=171) people, County E provides *e*(=286) people.
