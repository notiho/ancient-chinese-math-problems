今有出錢六百一十，買羽二千一百翭。欲其貴賤率之，問︰各幾何？
反其率術曰：以錢數為法，所率為實，實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法少，實多。二物各以所得多少之數乘法實，即物數。
荅曰：其 a(=1140)翭 ， b(=3)翭 一錢 其 c(=960)翭 ， d(=4)翭 一錢

Suppose there is an expenditure of 610 qian to buy 2100 feathers.
It is desired to determine the rates of the expensive and cheap feathers.
Question: what are the quantities and rates of each?

The procedure for reversing the rates says: Take the total amount of money as the divisor (法), and the total quantity of feathers as the dividend (實). 
Perform the division to find the rate for one unit. 
If the result is not an integer, reverse the process by subtracting the remainder from the divisor, making the divisor smaller and the dividend larger. 
For the two items, multiply the adjusted divisor and dividend by the quantities to determine the respective amounts.

Answer: The expensive feathers are *a*(=1140) feathers, at a rate of *b*(=3) feathers per qian. 
The cheap feathers are *c*(=960) feathers, at a rate of *d*(=4) feathers per qian.
