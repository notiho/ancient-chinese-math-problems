又有積五十六萬四千七百五十二步、四分步之一。問︰為方幾何？
開方術曰：置積為實。借一算步之，超一等。議所得，以一乘所借一算為法，而以除。除已，倍法為定法。其復除。折法而下。復置借算步之如初，以復議一乘之，所得副，以加定法，以除。以所得副從定法。復除折下如前。若開之不盡者為不可開，當以面命之。若實有分者，通分內子為定實。乃開之，訖，開其母報除。若母不可開者，又以母乘定實，乃開之，訖，令如母而一。
荅曰： a(=1503/2)步 。

Suppose there is an area of 564752 and 1/4 bu². 
Question: what is the side length of the square field?

The procedure for extracting square roots says: Place the area as the dividend. Borrow one counting rod, placing it, and skip one place. 
Estimate the result. Multiply the estimated result by the borrowed counting rod, obtaining the divisor, and divide. After dividing, double the divisor to obtain the fixed divisor. Divide again. Subtract the divisor and bring down the next digit. Repeat the process. 
If the square root cannot be fully extracted, it is considered "not exact," and the result should be expressed as a side length. 
If the dividend has fractions, convert them into a common fraction and treat it as the dividend. Extract the square root of the numerator, then extract the square root of the denominator. If the denominator cannot be extracted, multiply the numerator by the denominator and extract the square root of the product, ensuring the result is expressed as a fraction.

Answer: *a*(=1503/2) bu.
