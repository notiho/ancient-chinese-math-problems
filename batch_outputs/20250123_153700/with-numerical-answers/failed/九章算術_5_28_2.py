今有冥谷上廣二丈，袤七丈，下廣八尺，袤四丈，深六丈五尺。問︰積幾何？
荅曰：五萬二千尺。
荅曰：人到二百一尺、五十分尺之十三。用徒二百五十八人、一萬六十三分人之三千七百四十六。
術曰：以一車積尺乘程行步數為實。置今往來步數，加載輸之間一里，以車六人乘之，為法。除之，所得即一人所到尺。以所到約積尺，即用徒人數。
荅曰：人到 a(=10063/50)尺 。用徒 b(=2600000/10063)人 。

Suppose there is a valley with the following dimensions:
- The top width is 2 zhang, and the top length is 7 zhang.
- The bottom width is 8 chi, and the bottom length is 4 zhang.
- The depth is 6 zhang and 5 chi.

Question: What is the total volume of the valley?

Answer: The total volume is 52000 cubic chi.

Additionally:
- How far does one person carry the earth? Answer: *a*(=10063/50) chi.
- How many workers are required? Answer: *b*(=2600000/10063) workers.

The procedure says:
- Multiply the volume of one cart (in cubic chi) by the number of steps traveled to obtain the dividend.
- Place the total round-trip steps, adding the distance of one li for loading and unloading, and multiply by 6 (the number of people per cart) to obtain the divisor.
- Divide to find the distance one person carries the earth (in chi).
- Use this distance to divide the total volume to determine the number of workers required.
