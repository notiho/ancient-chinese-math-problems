Place the volume as the dividend (\u5be6). Borrow one counting rod (\u7b97) and mark it, skipping two places (\u8d85\u4e8c\u7b49).\n2. Estimate the number (\u8b70\u6240\u5f97). Multiply it by itself twice to form the divisor (\u6cd5), and divide.\n3. After dividing, multiply the result by 3 to form the fixed divisor (\u5b9a\u6cd5). Divide again, and reduce the remainder as before.\n4. Multiply the result by 3 and place it in the middle row (\u4e2d\u884c). Borrow one counting rod and place it in the lower row (\u4e0b\u884c). Mark it, skipping one place in the middle and two places in the lower row.\n5. Estimate again. Multiply the middle row by 1 and the lower row by 2, adding them to the fixed divisor. Divide by the fixed divisor.\n6. After dividing, double the lower row and add it to the middle row to form the new fixed divisor. Divide again, and reduce the remainder as before.\n7. If the volume cannot be fully divided, it is considered not extractable. If the volume has fractions, convert them to a common denominator and extract the cube root of the numerator and denominator separately.
