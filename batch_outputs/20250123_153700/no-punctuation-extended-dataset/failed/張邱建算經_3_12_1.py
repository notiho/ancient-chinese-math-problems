Suppose there are three brothers, Meng, Zhong, and Ji, each holding an unknown number of bolts of silk.
The eldest brother (Meng) says to his two younger brothers: "If I take half of each of your silk, I will have 79 bolts in total."
The second brother (Zhong) says: "If I take half of each of your silk, I will have 68 bolts in total."
The youngest brother (Ji) says: "If I take half of each of your silk, I will have 57 bolts in total."
Question: How many bolts of silk does each brother originally hold?

The procedure says: 
- Meng's equation: 2 Zhong + 1 Ji = 158 bolts.
- Zhong's equation: 1 Meng + 2 Ji = 136 bolts.
- Ji's equation: 1 Meng + 1 Zhong = 114 bolts.
Solve using the method of simultaneous equations.

The method of simultaneous equations says:
1. Arrange the coefficients of the variables (Meng, Zhong, Ji) and the constants on the right-hand side.
2. Use elimination and substitution to solve for each variable systematically.

Answer: Meng has *a* bolts, Zhong has *b* bolts, and Ji has *c* bolts.

# Meng's equation: 2 Zhong + 1 Ji = 158
# Zhong's equation: 1 Meng + 2 Ji = 136
# Ji's equation: 1 Meng + 1 Zhong = 114

# Step 1: Represent the equations
# Let Meng = x, Zhong = y, Ji = z
# Equation 1: 2y + z = 158
# Equation 2: x + 2z = 136
# Equation 3: x + y = 114

# Step 2: Solve for y in terms of x from Equation 3
y = 114 - x

# Step 3: Substitute y into Equation 1
# 2(114 - x) + z = 158
# 228 - 2x + z = 158
# z = 2x - 70  (Equation 4)

# Step 4: Substitute z into Equation 2
# x + 2(2x - 70) = 136
# x + 4x - 140 = 136
# 5x = 276
x = Fraction(276, 5)  # Meng's bolts

# Step 5: Solve for y using Equation 3
y = 114 - x  # Zhong's bolts

# Step 6: Solve for z using Equation 4
z = 2 * x - 70  # Ji's bolts

# Final results
a = x  # Meng's bolts
b = y  # Zhong's bolts
c = z  # Ji's bolts
