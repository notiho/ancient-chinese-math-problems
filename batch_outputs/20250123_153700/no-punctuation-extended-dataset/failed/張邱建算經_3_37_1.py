This is a classic problem known as the "Hundred Chickens Problem." The goal is to determine how many roosters (雞翁), hens (雞母), and chicks (雞雛) can be purchased with 100 coins while ensuring the total number of chickens is 100. The problem involves solving a system of equations with constraints.

The given procedure outlines a method to solve the problem, but it also acknowledges that the historical text may have missing or unclear parts. Below is the Python implementation of the solution based on the described procedure:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Constants for the problem
total_money = 100  # Total money available
total_chickens = 100  # Total chickens to buy
rooster_price = 5  # Price of one rooster
hen_price = 3  # Price of one hen
chick_price = Fraction(1, 3)  # Price of one chick (3 chicks for 1 coin)

# Initialize lists to store solutions
solutions = []

# Iterate over possible numbers of roosters (雞翁)
for roosters in range(total_money // rooster_price + 1):
    # Iterate over possible numbers of hens (雞母)
    for hens in range(total_money // hen_price + 1):
        # Calculate the number of chicks (雞雛)
        chicks = total_chickens - roosters - hens
        # Check if the number of chicks is non-negative and the total cost matches
        if chicks >= 0 and (roosters * rooster_price + hens * hen_price + chicks * chick_price) == total_money:
            # Store the solution
            solutions.append((roosters, hens, chicks))

# Output the solutions
for solution in solutions:
    roosters, hens, chicks = solution
    print(f"雞翁 {roosters} 直錢 {roosters * rooster_price} 雞母 {hens} 直錢 {hens * hen_price} 雞雛 {chicks} 直錢 {chicks * chick_price}")


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Constants**: The total money, total chickens, and prices for roosters, hens, and chicks are defined.
2. **Iterative Search**: The code iterates over all possible numbers of roosters and hens. For each combination, it calculates the number of chicks.
3. **Validation**: It checks if the total cost matches the available money and if the total number of chickens is 100.
4. **Solutions**: Valid solutions are stored and printed.

### Example Output:
The output will list all possible combinations of roosters, hens, and chicks that satisfy the problem's constraints. Each solution will include the number of each type of chicken and the corresponding cost.

For example:
```
雞翁 4 直錢 20 雞母 18 直錢 54 雞雛 78 直錢 26
雞翁 8 直錢 40 雞母 11 直錢 33 雞雛 81 直錢 27
雞翁 12 直錢 60 雞母 4 直錢 12 雞雛 84 直錢 28
```

This approach ensures all possible solutions are found and adheres to the constraints of the problem.
