Suppose there is a cube with a volume of 96 cubic chi. It is desired to convert it into a sphere.
Question: what is the diameter of the sphere?

The procedure says: Take the cube's volume and multiply it by itself (square it), then multiply it by 16.
Divide the result by 9.
Take the cube root of the result, and that is the diameter of the sphere.

Answer: the diameter is *a* chi.
