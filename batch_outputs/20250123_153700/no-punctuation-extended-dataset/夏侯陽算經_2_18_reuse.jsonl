Subtract this from the total, leaving the remainder.\n\nAnswer: *a* bolts are fully paid for, and *b* bolts remain for tailoring.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# \u5e03\u4e09\u767e\u4e5d\u5341\u516d\u7aef\n\u5e03\u6578 = 396\n\n# \u6bcf\u7aef\u4e8c\u4e08\u4e94\u5c3a\n\u6bcf\u7aef\u9577\u5ea6_\u4e08 = 2\n\u6bcf\u7aef\u9577\u5ea6_\u5c3a = 5\n\n# \u6bcf\u7aef\u5225\u4e00\u767e\u516b\u5341\u6587\n\u8173\u9322 = 180\n\n# \u6bcf\u7aef\u5e03\u50f9\u4e09\u767e\u516d\u5341\u6587\n\u5e03\u50f9 = 360\n\n# \u7f6e\u5e03\u6578\u500d\u4e08\u5c3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e00\u767e\u516b\u5341\u6587\u4e58\u4e4b\uff0c\u5f97\u4e03\u842c\u4e00\u5343\u4e09\u767e\u4e03\u5341\u6587\u70ba\u5be6\n\u5be6 = \u5e03\u6578 * (\u6bcf\u7aef\u9577\u5ea6_\u4e08 * 10 + \u6bcf\u7aef\u9577\u5ea6_\u5c3a) * \u8173\u9322\n\n# \u5217\u8173\u9322\u4e00\u767e\u516b\u5341\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u5165\u50f9\u9322\u4e09\u767e\u516d\u5341\u6587\uff0c\u5f97\u4e94\u767e\u56db\u5341\u6587\u70ba\u6cd5\n\u6cd5 = \u5e03\u50f9 + \u8173\u9322\n\n# \u5be6\u5982\u6cd5\u5f97\u8173\u7aef\uff0c\u4e0d\u76e1\u4e5d\u5341\u6587\n\u8173\u7aef = \u5be6 // \u6cd5\n\u9918\u6587 = \u5be6 % \u6cd5\n\n# \u9918\u6587\u9032\u4f4d\u56e0\u4e4b\uff0c\u5f97\u516b\u5c3a\u4e09\u5bf8\n\u9918\u5c3a = (\u9918\u6587 * 10) // \u6cd5\n\u9918\u5bf8 = Fraction((\u9918\u6587 * 10) % \u6cd5, \u6cd5) * 10\n\n# \u4ee5\u4e0b\u6cd5\u9664\uff0c\u5f97\u4e09\u5206\u5bf8\u4e4b\u4e00\u70ba\u547d\u5206\n\u547d\u5206 = Fraction(\u9918\u5bf8).limit_denominator(18)\n\n# \u7b54\u6848\na = \u8173\u7aef\nb = Fraction(\u9918\u5c3a, 10) + \u547d\u5206", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1899, "completion_tokens": 2904, "total_tokens": 4803, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ec7eab8ec3"}}, "error": null}
