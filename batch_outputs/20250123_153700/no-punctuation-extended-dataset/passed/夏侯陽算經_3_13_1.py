Suppose there are 2567 hu and 5 dou of coarse rice. It is desired to mill it twice.
For every 8 sheng, 1 sheng is lost.
Question: how much polished rice is obtained in total?

The procedure says: Place the amount of rice, multiply by 7, and divide by 8 to obtain the amount.
When seeking the original rice, multiply by 8 and divide by 7.

Answer: the polished rice is *a* hu.

# 置米數，以七因八除
熟米 = 米 * Fraction(耗率分子, 耗率分母)
