Suppose one person in one day can make 38 male tiles (牡瓦), and one person in one day can make 76 female tiles (牝瓦).
Now, if one person in one day is tasked to make tiles such that the male and female tiles are equal in number, how many tiles can they make in total?

Answer: *a* tiles.

# The rate for making one male tile and one female tile is the harmonic mean of the two rates:
