今有望松生山上，不知高下。立兩表齊，高二丈，前後相去五十步，令後表與前表參相直。從前表卻行七步四尺，薄地遙望松末，與表端參合。又望松本，入表二尺八寸。复從後表卻行八步五尺，薄地遙望松末，亦與表端參合。問松高及山去表各幾何？
答曰：松高 a丈 ；山去表 b里 。

This is a classic ancient Chinese math problem involving similar triangles and proportions to calculate the height of a tree (松高) and the distance from the tree to the measurement point (山去表). Let's break it down and solve it step by step.

---

### Problem Setup:
1. Two poles (表) are erected, each 2 丈 tall.
2. The distance between the two poles is 50 步.
3. Observations are made from two positions:
   - From the first pole, the observer steps back 7 步 4 尺 and aligns the top of the tree with the top of the pole. The base of the tree aligns 2 尺 8 寸 inside the pole.
   - From the second pole, the observer steps back 8 步 5 尺 and aligns the top of the tree with the top of the pole.

We are tasked to find:
- The height of the tree (松高, `a` 丈).
- The distance from the tree to the first pole (山去表, `b` 里).

---

### Solution:

We will use similar triangles to solve this problem. Let’s denote:
- 松高 (height of the tree) as `a` 丈.
- 山去表 (distance from the tree to the first pole) as `b` 步.

#### Observations:
1. From the first observation:
   - The observer is 7 步 4 尺 = \( 7 + \frac{4}{10} = 7.4 \) 步 behind the first pole.
   - The base of the tree is 2 尺 8 寸 = \( \frac{28}{10} = 2.8 \) 步 inside the pole.
   - Using similar triangles, the ratio of the height of the tree to the distance from the tree to the first pole can be expressed as:
     \[
     \frac{a}{b} = \frac{2}{b + 7.4 - 2.8}
     \]

2. From the second observation:
   - The observer is 8 步 5 尺 = \( 8 + \frac{5}{10} = 8.5 \) 步 behind the second pole.
   - The distance between the two poles is 50 步.
   - Using similar triangles again, the ratio of the height of the tree to the distance from the tree to the second pole can be expressed as:
     \[
     \frac{a}{b + 50} = \frac{2}{b + 50 + 8.5}
     \]

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Observations and constants
pole_height = 2  # 丈
distance_between_poles = 50  # 步

# First observation
observer_behind_first_pole = Fraction(74, 10)  # 7 步 4 尺 = 7.4 步
tree_base_inside_first_pole = Fraction(28, 10)  # 2 尺 8 寸 = 2.8 步

# Second observation
observer_behind_second_pole = Fraction(85, 10)  # 8 步 5 尺 = 8.5 步

# Using similar triangles:
# From the first observation:
# a / b = 2 / (b + 7.4 - 2.8)
# => a = 2 * (b + 7.4 - 2.8)
# => a = 2 * (b + 4.6)
a_first = lambda b: 2 * (b + Fraction(46, 10))

# From the second observation:
# a / (b + 50) = 2 / (b + 50 + 8.5)
# => a = 2 * (b + 50) / (b + 50 + 8.5)
a_second = lambda b: 2 * (b + 50) / (b + 50 + Fraction(85, 10))

# Solve for b where a_first(b) == a_second(b)
b = None
for candidate in range(1, 1000):  # Brute force over possible values of b
    candidate_b = Fraction(candidate, 10)  # Test b in increments of 0.1
    if a_first(candidate_b) == a_second(candidate_b):
        b = candidate_b
        break

# Calculate a using either formula
a = a_first(b)

# Convert b from 步 to 里 (1 里 = 300 步)
b_in_li = b / 300

# Output results
print(f"松高 a = {a} 丈")
print(f"山去表 b = {b_in_li} 里")


"""


---

### Explanation of the Code:
1. We use the `Fraction` class to ensure precise calculations with fractions.
2. Two equations are derived from the observations using similar triangles.
3. We solve for `b` (distance from the tree to the first pole) by equating the two equations for `a`.
4. Once `b` is found, we calculate `a` (height of the tree).
5. Finally, we convert `b` from 步 to 里 (1 里 = 300 步).

---

### Final Answer:
- 松高 \( a \) = 12 丈 (example value, depends on solving the equations).
- 山去表 \( b \) = 0.4 里 (example value, depends on solving the equations).
