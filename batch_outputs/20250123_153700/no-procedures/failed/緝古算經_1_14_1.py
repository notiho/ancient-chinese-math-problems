This problem involves a right triangle where the product of the two legs (the "ju" and "gu") is given, and the hypotenuse ("xian") is related to one of the legs. Let's solve it step by step.

---

### Problem:
- The product of the two legs (ju and gu) is \( \frac{1}{765} \).
- The hypotenuse (xian) is greater than one leg (ju) by \( \frac{9}{36} = \frac{1}{4} \).
- Find the values of ju (\( a \)), gu (\( b \)), and xian (\( c \)).

---

### Solution:

We know:
1. \( ju \times gu = \frac{1}{765} \)
2. \( xian = ju + \frac{1}{4} \)
3. By the Pythagorean theorem: \( xian^2 = ju^2 + gu^2 \)

Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
product_of_legs = Fraction(1, 765)  # ju * gu = 1/765
xian_difference = Fraction(1, 4)    # xian = ju + 1/4

# Let ju = a and gu = b
# From the product of the legs: b = product_of_legs / a
# From the hypotenuse relation: c = a + xian_difference

# Solve using the Pythagorean theorem: c^2 = a^2 + b^2
# Substitute b and c:
# (a + xian_difference)^2 = a^2 + (product_of_legs / a)^2

# Expand and rearrange:
# a^2 + 2*a*xian_difference + xian_difference^2 = a^2 + (product_of_legs / a)^2
# 2*a*xian_difference + xian_difference^2 = (product_of_legs / a)^2

# Solve for a, b, and c
xian_difference_squared = xian_difference ** 2

# Iterate to find a solution
for ju in range(1, 1000):  # Try possible values for ju
    ju = Fraction(ju, 1000)  # Convert to fraction
    gu = product_of_legs / ju  # Calculate gu
    xian = ju + xian_difference  # Calculate xian
    if xian**2 == ju**2 + gu**2:  # Check Pythagorean theorem
        a = ju
        b = gu
        c = xian
        break

# Output the results
a, b, c

### Explanation of the Code:
1. We start with the given relationships between the sides of the triangle.
2. Using the product of the legs, we express one leg (\( gu \)) in terms of the other (\( ju \)).
3. Using the hypotenuse relation, we express the hypotenuse (\( xian \)) in terms of \( ju \).
4. We substitute these into the Pythagorean theorem and solve for \( ju \), \( gu \), and \( xian \).
5. The loop iterates over possible values of \( ju \) (as fractions) to find a solution that satisfies all conditions.

---

### Final Answer:
The values of \( a \) (ju), \( b \) (gu), and \( c \) (xian) will be output by the code.
