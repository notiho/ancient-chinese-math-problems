Suppose there are two scenarios for buying a cow:
1. Seven families together contribute 190, but it is not enough by 330.
2. Nine families together contribute 270, but there is an excess of 30.

Question: How many families are there in total (*a*), and what is the price of the cow (*b*)?

Answer: *a* families, and the price of the cow is *b*.
"""

# Let the number of families be `a` and the price of the cow be `b`.

# From the first condition:
# 7 families contribute 190, but it is short by 330.
# This means the total price of the cow is:
# b = 190 + 330
b = 190 + 330

# From the second condition:
# 9 families contribute 270, but there is an excess of 30.
# This means the total price of the cow is:
# b = 270 - 30
# (This confirms the same value of b.)

# To find the number of families:
# Each family contributes the same amount. Let the contribution per family be `x`.
# From the first condition:
# 7x = 190
x = Fraction(190, 7)

# From the second condition:
# 9x = 270
# (This confirms the same value of x.)

# The total number of families `a` can be calculated as:
# a = b / x
a = Fraction(b, x)

# Final results:
a, b
