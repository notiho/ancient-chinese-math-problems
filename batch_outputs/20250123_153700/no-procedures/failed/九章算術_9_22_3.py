有山居木西，不知其高。山去木五十三里，木高九丈五尺。人立木東三里，望木末適與山峰斜平。人目高七尺。問︰山高幾何？
荅曰： a丈 。

There is a mountain west of a tree, but its height is unknown. The distance from the mountain to the tree is 53 li, and the tree's height is 9 zhang 5 chi. A person stands 3 li east of the tree, and from their perspective, the top of the tree aligns perfectly with the mountain peak. The person's eye level is 7 chi above the ground.

Question: What is the height of the mountain?

Answer: The mountain's height is *a* zhang.

# Given values
山到木距離 = 53  # li
木高 = 9 * 10 + 5  # Convert tree height to chi (1 zhang = 10 chi)
人到木距離 = 3  # li
人目高 = 7  # chi

# Total distance from the person to the mountain
總距離 = 山到木距離 + 人到木距離  # li

# The height difference between the top of the tree and the person's eye level
木高相對人目 = 木高 - 人目高  # chi

# Using similar triangles, the height of the mountain can be calculated as:
山高 = 木高相對人目 * 總距離 / 人到木距離  # chi

# Convert the mountain's height from chi to zhang
a = Fraction(山高, 10)  # 1 zhang = 10 chi

# Final result
a
