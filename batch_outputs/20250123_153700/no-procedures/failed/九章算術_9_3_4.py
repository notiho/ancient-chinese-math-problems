Suppose there is a cylindrical log with a diameter of 2 chi and 5 cun (2.5 chi). It is desired to make a square plank with a thickness of 7 cun (0.7 chi). 
Question: what is the width of the square plank?

Answer: the width is *a* chi.

# The square plank width is determined by the largest square that can fit within the circle
# The diagonal of the square equals the diameter of the circle
# Using the relationship: diagonal = width * sqrt(2), we solve for width

# To avoid using square roots, we use the approximation for sqrt(2) as 1.414
