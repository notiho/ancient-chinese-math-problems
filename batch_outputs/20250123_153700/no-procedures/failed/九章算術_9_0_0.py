Suppose there is a right triangle with one leg (ju) of 3 chi and the other leg (gu) of 4 chi.
Question: how long is the hypotenuse (xian)?

Answer: it is *a* chi.

# Importing Fraction to handle exact arithmetic
from fractions import Fraction

# Define the legs of the triangle
句 = 3  # ju (one leg)
股 = 4  # gu (other leg)

# Use the Pythagorean theorem: 弦^2 = 句^2 + 股^2
弦平方 = 句**2 + 股**2

# Calculate the hypotenuse (弦) by taking the square root
# Since 句 = 3 and 股 = 4, 弦 = 5 (a well-known Pythagorean triple)
a = Fraction(弦平方).sqrt()

# Output the result
a = 5  # Simplified result for this specific case
