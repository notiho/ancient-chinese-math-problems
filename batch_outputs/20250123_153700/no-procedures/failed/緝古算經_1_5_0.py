假令四郡輸粟，斛法二尺五寸，一人作功為均。自上給甲，以次與乙。其甲郡輸粟三萬八千七百四十五石六斗，乙郡輸粟三萬四千九百五石六斗，丙郡輸粟，二萬六千二百七十石四斗，丁郡輸粟一萬四千七十八石四斗。四郡共穿窖，上袤多於上廣一丈，少於下袤三丈，多於深六丈，少於下廣一丈。各計粟多少，均出丁夫。自穿、負、築，冬程人功常積一十二尺，一日役。問：窖上下廣、袤、深，郡別出人及窖深、廣各多少？
答曰：窖上廣 a丈 ，上袤 b丈 ，下廣 c丈 ，下袤 d丈 ，深 e丈 ；甲郡 f人 ，深 g尺 ，下袤 h丈 ，廣 i丈 ；乙郡 j人 ，深 k尺 ，下袤 l丈 ，廣 m丈 ；丙郡 n人 ，深 o尺 ，下袤 p丈 ，廣 q丈 ；丁郡 r人 ，深 s尺 ，下袤 t丈 ，廣 u丈 。

"""
This is a complex ancient Chinese math problem involving the calculation of a granary's dimensions and the distribution of labor among four regions based on the amount of grain they contribute. Let's break this down step by step and translate it into Python code.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Granary Dimensions**:
   - The granary's dimensions are described in terms of its upper width (`上廣`), upper length (`上袤`), lower width (`下廣`), lower length (`下袤`), and depth (`深`).
   - Relationships between these dimensions are provided:
     - `上袤` is 1 zhang more than `上廣`.
     - `上袤` is 3 zhang less than `下袤`.
     - `深` is 6 zhang more than `上袤`.
     - `下廣` is 1 zhang less than `深`.

2. **Grain Contributions**:
   - Four regions contribute grain in varying amounts (in 石 and 斗).
   - The total amount of grain determines the total labor required.

3. **Labor Distribution**:
   - Labor is distributed proportionally to the amount of grain contributed by each region.
   - Each worker can excavate 12 cubic chi per day.

4. **Output**:
   - The dimensions of the granary (`上廣`, `上袤`, `下廣`, `下袤`, `深`).
   - The number of workers required from each region.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Grain Conversion**:
   - All grain contributions are converted to `dou` for consistency.
2. **Granary Dimensions**:
   - The relationships between the dimensions are implemented using fractions to ensure accuracy.
3. **Granary Volume**:
   - The volume is calculated using the formula for a trapezoidal prism.
4. **Labor Calculation**:
   - The total labor required is calculated based on the granary's volume and the excavation rate.
   - Labor is distributed proportionally to the grain contributions of each region.
5. **Output**:
   - The dimensions of the granary and the number of workers required from each region are printed.

This code provides a step-by-step solution to the problem while maintaining accuracy using the `Fraction` class.
