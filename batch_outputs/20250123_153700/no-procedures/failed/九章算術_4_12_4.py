Suppose there is a volume of 25,281 cubic bu (步).
Question: if this volume forms a cube, what is the side length of the cube?

Answer: the side length is *a* bu.
"""

# 積二萬五千二百八十一步
volume = 25281

# To find the side length of the cube, take the cube root of the volume
# We approximate the cube root using fractions since we cannot use external libraries.

# Start with an approximation for the cube root
# Let's use trial and error to find the closest integer cube root
a = 29  # 29^3 = 24389, which is close to 25281

# Refine the result if necessary
# Since 25281 is not a perfect cube, the exact cube root would be slightly larger than 29.

Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 159, Actual: 29"""
