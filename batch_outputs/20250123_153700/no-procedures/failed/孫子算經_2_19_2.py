Suppose there is a total area of 35,000 square bu. It is desired to form a circle.
Question: what is the diameter of the circle?

Answer: the diameter is *a* bu.

# 積三萬五千步
積 = 35000

# The formula for the area of a circle is A = (π/4) * d^2, where d is the diameter.
# Rearranging for d: d = sqrt(4 * A / π)
# In ancient Chinese mathematics, π is approximated as 3.

# Using π = 3, the formula becomes:
# d = sqrt(4 * A / 3)

# Calculate the diameter
a = (4 * 積 / 3) ** Fraction(1, 2)  # Square root calculation using fractional exponent
