Suppose there is a total of 576 qian (coins) used to buy 78 bamboo items. The bamboo items are of two sizes: large and small. 
The price of the large bamboo is 9 qian each, and the price of the small bamboo is 7 qian each.
Question: how many of each size are purchased?

Answer: *a* large bamboo items at *b* qian each, and *c* small bamboo items at *d* qian each.

# Total money and total bamboo items

# Prices of large and small bamboo

# Let x = number of large bamboo items
# Let y = number of small bamboo items
