荅曰： a枚 。

Suppose one person can make 38 male tiles (牡瓦) in one day, and one person can make 76 female tiles (牝瓦) in one day.
Now, if one person is tasked to make tiles such that the male and female tiles are in equal proportion (half male, half female), how many tiles can they make in one day?

Answer: *a* tiles.
"""

# One day's production of male tiles (牡瓦)
male_tiles = 38

# One day's production of female tiles (牝瓦)
female_tiles = 76

# To make equal proportions of male and female tiles, calculate the combined rate:
# Since male and female tiles are produced at different rates, we calculate the harmonic mean of the rates.
# The formula for the combined rate is:
# (2 * male_tiles * female_tiles) / (male_tiles + female_tiles)

combined_rate = Fraction(2 * male_tiles * female_tiles, male_tiles + female_tiles)

# The total number of tiles produced in one day is the combined rate.
a = combined_rate

# Result
a

Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 76/3, Actual: 152/3"""
