Suppose there is an unknown amount of rice in a 10-dou container. The container is filled with millet, and after pounding, 7 dou of rice are obtained.
Question: how much rice was originally in the container?

Answer: *a* dou.

# Total capacity of the container

# Let the original amount of rice be "a"
# After pounding, the amount of rice retained is a * retention_ratio
