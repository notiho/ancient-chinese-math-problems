今有望深谷，偃矩岸上，令句高六尺。從句端望谷底，入下股九尺一寸。又設重矩于上，其矩間相去三丈。更從句端望谷底，入上股八尺五寸。問谷深幾何？
答曰： a丈 。

This is a classic problem involving geometry and similar triangles. Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.

### Problem Explanation:
- A carpenter's square (right triangle) is placed on the edge of a cliff.
- The vertical leg (句) of the square is 6 chi (尺) tall.
- From the top of the vertical leg, the bottom of the valley is observed, and the horizontal leg (股) extends 9 chi 1 cun (寸) into the valley.
- Another carpenter's square is placed 3 zhang (丈) away horizontally from the first one.
- From the top of the second vertical leg, the bottom of the valley is observed again, and the horizontal leg extends 8 chi 5 cun into the valley.
- The task is to calculate the depth of the valley (谷深).

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Constants
丈_to_尺 = 10  # 1 丈 = 10 尺
尺_to_寸 = 10  # 1 尺 = 10 寸

# First square
句1 = 6  # Vertical leg of the first square (in 尺)
股1 = 9 + Fraction(1, 尺_to_寸)  # Horizontal leg of the first square (in 尺)

# Second square
句2 = 6  # Vertical leg of the second square (in 尺)
股2 = 8 + Fraction(5, 尺_to_寸)  # Horizontal leg of the second square (in 尺)

# Distance between the two squares
矩間 = 3 * 丈_to_尺  # Distance between the two squares (in 尺)

# Using similar triangles to calculate the depth of the valley
# Depth of the valley = (股1 * 矩間) / (股1 - 股2)
谷深 = (股1 * 矩間) / (股1 - 股2)

# Convert the depth to 丈
谷深_in_丈 = 谷深 / 丈_to_尺

# Output the result
谷深_in_丈


"""

### Explanation of the Formula:
The problem involves two similar triangles formed by the carpenter's squares and the valley. Using the property of similar triangles, the depth of the valley can be calculated as:

\[
\text{谷深} = \frac{\text{股1} \times \text{矩間}}{\text{股1} - \text{股2}}
\]

Where:
- 股1 and 股2 are the horizontal legs of the two squares.
- 矩間 is the horizontal distance between the two squares.

Finally, the depth is converted from chi (尺) to zhang (丈) for the final answer.

---

### Final Answer:
The variable `谷深_in_丈` will contain the depth of the valley in zhang (丈).
