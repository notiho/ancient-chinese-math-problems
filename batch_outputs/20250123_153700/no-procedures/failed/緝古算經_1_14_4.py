This problem involves solving a right triangle where the product of the two legs (the "ju" and "gu") is given, and the hypotenuse ("xian") is related to one of the legs by a specific difference. Let's solve it step by step.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given:**
   - The product of the two legs (ju × gu) = \( \frac{1}{765} \).
   - The hypotenuse (xian) is greater than the ju by \( \frac{9}{36} = \frac{1}{4} \).

2. **Unknowns:**
   - \( \text{ju} = a \)
   - \( \text{gu} = b \)
   - \( \text{xian} = c \)

3. **Relationships:**
   - \( a \cdot b = \frac{1}{765} \)
   - \( c = a + \frac{1}{4} \)
   - By the Pythagorean theorem: \( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \).

---

### Solution in Python:


"""


from fractions import Fraction
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define variables
a, b, c = symbols('a b c')

# Given conditions
product_condition = Eq(a * b, Fraction(1, 765))  # a * b = 1/765
hypotenuse_condition = Eq(c, a + Fraction(1, 4))  # c = a + 1/4
pythagorean_condition = Eq(c**2, a**2 + b**2)  # c^2 = a^2 + b^2

# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve((product_condition, hypotenuse_condition, pythagorean_condition), (a, b, c))

# Extract the results
a = solution[0][0]  # ju
b = solution[0][1]  # gu
c = solution[0][2]  # xian

# Print the results
a, b, c


"""


---

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Symbols:** We define `a`, `b`, and `c` as symbolic variables to represent the ju, gu, and xian.
2. **Equations:**
   - The first equation represents the product of the two legs.
   - The second equation relates the hypotenuse to the ju.
   - The third equation is the Pythagorean theorem.
3. **Solve:** We solve the system of equations simultaneously to find the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

---

### Final Answer:
After solving the equations, the values of ju, gu, and xian will be computed. The exact values will depend on solving the equations symbolically or numerically.
