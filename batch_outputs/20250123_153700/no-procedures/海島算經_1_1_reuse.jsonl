Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.\n\n---\n\n### Problem Setup:\n1. Two poles (\u8868) are erected, each 2 \u4e08 tall.\n2. The distance between the two poles is 50 \u6b65.\n3. Observations are made from two positions:\n   - From the front pole, stepping back 7 \u6b65 4 \u5c3a (7.4 \u6b65), the top of the tree aligns with the top of the pole, and the base of the tree aligns with a point 2 \u5c3a 8 \u5bf8 (2.8 \u5c3a) above the ground.\n   - From the back pole, stepping back 8 \u6b65 5 \u5c3a (8.5 \u6b65), the top of the tree again aligns with the top of the pole.\n\nWe are tasked with finding:\n- The height of the tree (\u677e\u9ad8, `a` \u4e08).\n- The horizontal distance from the tree to the front pole (\u5c71\u53bb\u8868, `b` \u91cc).\n\n---\n\n### Assumptions and Conversions:\n1. 1 \u4e08 = 10 \u5c3a.\n2. 1 \u6b65 = 6 \u5c3a.\n3. 1 \u91cc = 300 \u6b65.\n\n---\n\n### Solution:\nWe use similar triangles to solve for the height of the tree and the horizontal distance. Here's the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Constants\n\u4e08_to_\u5c3a = 10  # 1 \u4e08 = 10 \u5c3a\n\u6b65_to_\u5c3a = 6    # 1 \u6b65 = 6 \u5c3a\n\u91cc_to_\u6b65 = 300  # 1 \u91cc = 300 \u6b65\n\n# Pole height\npole_height = 2 * \u4e08_to_\u5c3a  # 2 \u4e08 = 20 \u5c3a\n\n# Distances\ndistance_between_poles = 50 * \u6b65_to_\u5c3a  # 50 \u6b65 = 300 \u5c3a\nfront_observation_distance = 7 + Fraction(4, 10)  # 7 \u6b65 4 \u5c3a = 7.4 \u6b65\nfront_observation_distance_in_\u5c3a = front_observation_distance * \u6b65_to_\u5c3a  # Convert to \u5c3a\nfront_base_offset = 2 + Fraction(8, 10)  # 2 \u5c3a 8 \u5bf8 = 2.8 \u5c3a\n\nback_observation_distance = 8 + Fraction(5, 10)  # 8 \u6b65 5 \u5c3a = 8.5 \u6b65\nback_observation_distance_in_\u5c3a = back_observation_distance * \u6b65_to_\u5c3a  # Convert to \u5c3a\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the height of the tree (\u677e\u9ad8)\n# Using similar triangles from the front observation\ntree_height = pole_height * front_observation_distance_in_\u5c3a / front_base_offset\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the horizontal distance from the tree to the front pole (\u5c71\u53bb\u8868)\n# Using similar triangles from the back observation\ntree_to_pole_distance = (tree_height * distance_between_poles) / (tree_height - pole_height)\n\n# Convert the horizontal distance to \u91cc\ntree_to_pole_distance_in_\u91cc = tree_to_pole_distance / (\u91cc_to_\u6b65 * \u6b65_to_\u5c3a)\n\n# Convert the tree height back to \u4e08\ntree_height_in_\u4e08 = tree_height / \u4e08_to_\u5c3a\n\n# Results\na = tree_height_in_\u4e08  # \u677e\u9ad8 in \u4e08\nb = tree_to_pole_distance_in_\u91cc  # \u5c71\u53bb\u8868 in \u91cc\n\n# Output the results\na, b\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Tree Height (\u677e\u9ad8):**\n   - From the front observation, we use the ratio of the pole height to the distance from the observer to the base offset to calculate the tree height using similar triangles.\n\n2. **Horizontal Distance (\u5c71\u53bb\u8868):**\n   - From the back observation, we use the ratio of the tree height to the difference in height between the tree and the pole to calculate the horizontal distance using similar triangles.\n\n3. **Unit Conversions:**\n   - All calculations are performed in \u5c3a, and the final results are converted to \u4e08 for the tree height and \u91cc for the horizontal distance.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n- \u677e\u9ad8 `a` \u4e08.\n- \u5c71\u53bb\u8868 `b` \u91cc.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1094, "completion_tokens": 5106, "total_tokens": 6200, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ec7eab8ec3"}}, "error": null}
