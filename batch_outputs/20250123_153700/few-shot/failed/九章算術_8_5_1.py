今有上禾三秉，益實六斗，當下禾十秉。下禾五秉，益實一斗，當上禾二秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾三秉正，下禾一十秉負，益實六斗負。次置上禾二秉負，下禾五秉正，益實一斗負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a斗 ，下禾一秉實 b斗 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations to determine the yield of one sheaf of upper millet (*上禾*) and one sheaf of lower millet (*下禾*). The procedure follows the ancient Chinese method of solving simultaneous equations, similar to Gaussian elimination.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Equations**:
   - 3 sheaves of upper millet (*上禾*) plus 6 dou of grain equals the yield of 10 sheaves of lower millet (*下禾*).
   - 5 sheaves of lower millet (*下禾*) plus 1 dou of grain equals the yield of 2 sheaves of upper millet (*上禾*).

2. **Unknowns**:
   - Yield of one sheaf of upper millet (*上禾*), denoted as `a` (in dou).
   - Yield of one sheaf of lower millet (*下禾*), denoted as `b` (in dou).

3. **Procedure**:
   - Translate the problem into a system of linear equations.
   - Solve the equations using the ancient Chinese elimination method.

### Python Code Implementation:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Coefficients from the problem
# Equation 1: 3a - 10b = -6
# Equation 2: -2a + 5b = -1

# Step 1: Represent the equations in matrix form
# Each row represents an equation: [coefficient of a, coefficient of b, constant term]
equations = [
    [3, -10, -6],  # 3a - 10b = -6
    [-2, 5, -1]    # -2a + 5b = -1
]

# Step 2: Eliminate one variable (use Gaussian elimination)
# Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second by 3 to align coefficients of 'a'
equations[0] = [2 * x for x in equations[0]]  # [6, -20, -12]
equations[1] = [3 * x for x in equations[1]]  # [-6, 15, -3]

# Add the two equations to eliminate 'a'
eliminated_a = [
    equations[0][0] + equations[1][0],  # Coefficient of 'a' (should be 0)
    equations[0][1] + equations[1][1],  # Coefficient of 'b'
    equations[0][2] + equations[1][2]   # Constant term
]  # Result: [0, -5, -15]

# Step 3: Solve for 'b' (lower millet yield per sheaf)
b = Fraction(-eliminated_a[2], eliminated_a[1])  # b = -(-15) / -5 = 3

# Step 4: Substitute 'b' back into one of the original equations to solve for 'a'
# Using the first equation: 3a - 10b = -6
a = Fraction(-6 - (-10 * b), 3)  # a = (-6 + 30) / 3 = 8

# Final results
print(f"上禾一秉實 a = {a}斗")
print(f"下禾一秉實 b = {b}斗")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Matrix Representation**:
   - The equations are represented as rows in a matrix, where each row contains the coefficients of the variables and the constant term.

2. **Elimination**:
   - The coefficients of one variable (`a`) are aligned by multiplying the equations by appropriate factors.
   - The equations are then added to eliminate `a`, leaving an equation with only `b`.

3. **Back Substitution**:
   - The value of `b` is substituted back into one of the original equations to solve for `a`.

4. **Fraction Handling**:
   - The `Fraction` class is used to ensure exact arithmetic throughout the calculations.

---

### Final Answer:
- The yield of one sheaf of upper millet (*上禾*) is **8 dou**.
- The yield of one sheaf of lower millet (*下禾*) is **3 dou**.
