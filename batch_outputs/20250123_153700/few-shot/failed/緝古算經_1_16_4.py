假令有句弦相乘冪一千三百三十七二十分之一，弦多股一、十分之一。問：股多少？
術曰：冪自乘，倍多而一，為立冪。又多再自乘，半之，減立冪，余為實。又多數自乘，倍之，為方法。又置多數，五之，二而一，為廉法，從。開立方除之，即股。案：此術脫簡既多，法亦煩擾，宜雲冪自乘，多數而一，所得四之，為實。多為廉法，從。立方開之，得減差，半之，即股。
答曰： a 。

This problem involves solving for the "leg" (股) of a right triangle when given the product of the hypotenuse (弦) and the base (句), as well as the relationship between the hypotenuse and the base. The procedure is complex, but it can be simplified as described in the commentary.

### Problem Restatement:
Suppose the product of the hypotenuse and the base is \( 1337 \frac{1}{20} \), and the hypotenuse exceeds the base by \( 1 \frac{1}{10} \). Question: What is the length of the base (股)?

### Simplified Procedure:
The commentary suggests a simplified approach:
1. Multiply the given product (冪) by the excess (多數), then divide by 4 to get the "real value" (實).
2. Use the excess (多數) as the divisor (廉法).
3. Take the cube root of the real value (實), subtract the excess, and divide by 2 to get the base (股).

### Implementation in Python:


"""


from fractions import Fraction
from math import pow

# 冪一千三百三十七二十分之一
冪 = Fraction(1337, 1) + Fraction(1, 20)

# 弦多股一、十分之一
多數 = Fraction(1, 1) + Fraction(1, 10)

# 冪自乘，多數而一，所得四之，為實
實 = (冪 * 多數) / 4

# 多為廉法，從
廉法 = 多數

# 立方開之，得減差，半之，即股
立方根 = pow(float(實), 1/3)  # Convert 实 to float for cube root calculation
減差 = 立方根 - float(廉法)
股 = Fraction(減差, 2)

# Answer
a = 股


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **冪**: The given product of the hypotenuse and the base is represented as a fraction.
2. **多數**: The difference between the hypotenuse and the base is also represented as a fraction.
3. **實**: The "real value" is calculated by multiplying the product by the excess and dividing by 4.
4. **廉法**: The excess is used as the divisor.
5. **立方開之**: The cube root of the real value is calculated.
6. **減差**: Subtract the excess from the cube root.
7. **股**: Divide the result by 2 to get the base.

### Final Answer:
The length of the base (股) is \( a \).
