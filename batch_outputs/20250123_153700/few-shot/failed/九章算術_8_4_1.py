今有上禾六秉，損實一斗八升，當下禾一十秉。下禾十五秉，損實五升，當上禾五秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾六秉正，下禾一十秉負，損實一斗八升正。次置上禾五秉負，下禾一十五秉正，損實五升正。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a升 ，下禾一秉實 b升 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using the ancient Chinese method of elimination, similar to Gaussian elimination. Let's carefully translate the procedure into Python code.

### Problem Description:
We are given:
1. 6 bundles of upper millet lose 1 dou and 8 sheng of grain, equivalent to 18 sheng, when compared to 10 bundles of lower millet.
2. 15 bundles of lower millet lose 5 sheng of grain when compared to 5 bundles of upper millet.

We need to determine the grain content of 1 bundle of upper millet (*a*) and 1 bundle of lower millet (*b*).

### Procedure:
The procedure involves setting up two equations and solving them step by step using elimination.

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Convert units to sheng (1 dou = 10 sheng)
損實1 = 1 * 10 + 8  # 1 dou 8 sheng = 18 sheng
損實2 = 5           # 5 sheng

# Coefficients for the equations:
# Equation 1: 6上禾 - 10下禾 = 18
上禾1 = 6
下禾1 = -10
實1 = 18

# Equation 2: -5上禾 + 15下禾 = 5
上禾2 = -5
下禾2 = 15
實2 = 5

# Elimination process:
# Multiply the first equation by 5 (to match 上禾 coefficients with the second equation)
上禾1 *= 5
下禾1 *= 5
實1 *= 5

# Multiply the second equation by 6 (to match 上禾 coefficients with the first equation)
上禾2 *= 6
下禾2 *= 6
實2 *= 6

# Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate 上禾
下禾_elim = 下禾1 - 下禾2
實_elim = 實1 - 实2

# Solve for 下禾 (1 bundle of lower millet)
b = Fraction(實_elim, 下禾_elim)

# Substitute b back into the first equation to solve for 上禾
實1_sub = 實1 - (下禾1 * b)
a = Fraction(實1_sub, 上禾1)

# Convert results to sheng
a = a  # Upper millet (a) in sheng
b = b  # Lower millet (b) in sheng

# Output the results
a, b


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Unit Conversion**: Convert all measurements to sheng for consistency.
2. **Set Up Equations**: Represent the problem as two linear equations.
3. **Elimination**: Use the elimination method to solve for one variable at a time.
4. **Substitution**: Substitute the solved variable back into one of the equations to find the other variable.
5. **Output**: The grain content of 1 bundle of upper millet (*a*) and 1 bundle of lower millet (*b*) is calculated in sheng.

### Answer:
The grain content of 1 bundle of upper millet is `a` sheng, and the grain content of 1 bundle of lower millet is `b` sheng.
