This problem involves calculating the radius of a circle given its area in ancient Chinese mathematical terms. The procedure is quite detailed and involves iterative approximation, which is essentially a form of long division. Below is the Python implementation of the procedure:

"""
Suppose there is an area of 35,000 bu.
Question: what is the radius of the circle?

The procedure says:
1. Place the area of 35,000 bu and multiply it by 12, obtaining 420,000 as the dividend.
2. Borrow one digit as the divisor, shifting the steps by one place to the hundreds position.
3. Place the quotient of 600 above the dividend, and place 60,000 below the dividend as the auxiliary.
4. The divisor above is called the "method of the square." Divide the dividend by the quotient, completing the division.
5. Double the method of the square, retreat the method by one place, and retreat the divisor by two places.
6. Place the next quotient of 40 above the previous quotient, and place 400 below the method of the square as the auxiliary.
7. The divisor above is called the "method of the edge." Divide the dividend by the quotient, completing the division.
8. Double the method of the edge, retreat the method by one place, and retreat the divisor by two places.
9. Place the next quotient of 8 above the previous quotient, and place 8 below the method of the edge as the auxiliary.
10. The divisor above is called the "method of the corner." Divide the dividend by the quotient, completing the division.
11. The final result is 648 bu and 96/1296 bu.

Answer: *a* bu.

### Explanation:
1. The procedure involves iterative approximation, where the area is divided step by step using a method similar to long division.
2. The result is expressed as a combination of an integer part and a fractional part.
3. The final result is `648 bu and 96/1296 bu`, which simplifies to `648 bu and 1/13 bu`.

Answer: `a = 648 + 1/13 bu`.
