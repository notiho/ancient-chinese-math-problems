Suppose there are 8,958 adult males (丁). For every 3 males, 1 soldier is recruited.
Question: how many soldiers are recruited?

The procedure says: Place the number 8,958 and divide it by 3 to obtain the result.

Answer: *a* soldiers.

# 列八千九百五十八人
丁 = 8958

# 以三除之即得
a = 丁 // 3  # Using integer division since the number of soldiers must be whole.
