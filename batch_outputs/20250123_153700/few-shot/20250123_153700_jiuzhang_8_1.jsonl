Let's translate the problem and solution into Python code.\n\n### Problem Description:\nThere are three types of horses:\n- One Wu horse (\u6b66\u99ac),\n- Two Zhong horses (\u4e2d\u99ac),\n- Three Xia horses (\u4e0b\u99ac).\n\nEach horse is tasked with carrying 40 shi (\u77f3) of weight up a slope, but none of them can do so alone. To solve the problem, they borrow strength from each other:\n- The Wu horse borrows one Zhong horse,\n- The Zhong horse borrows one Xia horse,\n- The Xia horse borrows one Wu horse.\n\nAfter borrowing, all horses are able to carry the weight up the slope. The question is: how much pulling force (in shi) does each type of horse have?\n\n### Procedure:\nThe procedure involves setting up and solving a system of linear equations using the described method. Let's implement this step-by-step in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Step 1: Define the borrowing relationships as equations\n# Let a = pulling force of Wu horse (\u6b66\u99ac)\n# Let b = pulling force of Zhong horse (\u4e2d\u99ac)\n# Let c = pulling force of Xia horse (\u4e0b\u99ac)\n\n# Equation 1: Wu horse + 1 Zhong horse = 40 shi\n# a + b = 40\n\n# Equation 2: Zhong horse + 1 Xia horse = 40 shi\n# b + c = 40\n\n# Equation 3: Xia horse + 1 Wu horse = 40 shi\n# c + a = 40\n\n# Step 2: Solve the system of equations using substitution/elimination\n# From Equation 1: b = 40 - a\n# Substitute b into Equation 2: (40 - a) + c = 40\n# Simplify: c = a\n# Substitute c into Equation 3: a + a = 40\n# Simplify: 2a = 40\n# Solve for a: a = 20\n\n# Step 3: Solve for b and c using the values of a\na = 20  # Pulling force of Wu horse\nb = 40 - a  # From Equation 1\nc = a  # From the substitution step\n\n# Step 4: Output the results\nprint(f\"\u6b66\u99ac\u4e00\u5339\u529b\u5f15 {a} \u77f3\")  # Wu horse pulling force\nprint(f\"\u4e2d\u99ac\u4e00\u5339\u529b\u5f15 {b} \u77f3\")  # Zhong horse pulling force\nprint(f\"\u4e0b\u99ac\u4e00\u5339\u529b\u5f15 {c} \u77f3\")  # Xia horse pulling force\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Solution:\n1. We set up three equations based on the borrowing relationships:\n   - \\( a + b = 40 \\)\n   - \\( b + c = 40 \\)\n   - \\( c + a = 40 \\)\n2. Using substitution, we express \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) in terms of \\( a \\), and solve for \\( a \\).\n3. Once \\( a \\) is determined, we substitute back to find \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n4.
