又有田廣九分步之七，從十一分步之九。問：為田幾何？
乘分術曰：母相乘為法，子相乘為實，實如法而一。
荅曰： a步 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to compute the area of the field based on the given fractions. The problem states that the field is \( \frac{7}{9} \) of its width and \( \frac{9}{11} \) of its length. The area of the field is the product of these two fractions.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given fractions
width_fraction = Fraction(7, 9)
length_fraction = Fraction(9, 11)

# Compute the area
a = width_fraction * length_fraction

# The result is stored in variable 'a'


"""


The variable `a` will contain the area of the field in terms of "步".
