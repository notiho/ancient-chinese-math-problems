今有一人一日為牡瓦三十八枚，一人一日為牝瓦七十六枚。今令一人一日作瓦，牝、牡相半，問︰成瓦幾何？
術曰：并牝、牡為法，牝牡相乘為實，實如法得一枚。
荅曰： a枚 。

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tiles (瓦) one person can make in a day if they produce an equal number of male tiles (牡瓦) and female tiles (牝瓦). Here's the Python code to compute the value of `a`:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
male_tiles_per_day = 38  # 牡瓦 per day
female_tiles_per_day = 76  # 牝瓦 per day

# Combine male and female tiles as the "法" (total rate of production)
total_rate = male_tiles_per_day + female_tiles_per_day

# Multiply male and female rates as the "實" (product of rates)
product_of_rates = male_tiles_per_day * female_tiles_per_day

# Compute the number of tiles produced per day when male and female tiles are equal
a = Fraction(product_of_rates, total_rate)

# Result
a  # This is the number of tiles (瓦) produced per day


"""


The variable `a` will contain the solution in terms of tiles per day.
