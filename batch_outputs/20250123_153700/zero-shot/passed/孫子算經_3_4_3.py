"""
To solve this problem, we are given a chessboard with 19 rows and 19 columns (a 19x19 grid). The task is to calculate the total number of intersections (or points) on the board, which is simply the square of the number of rows or columns.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
side_length = 19

# Calculation
a = side_length * side_length  # Total number of intersections

# Result
a


"""


The variable `a` will contain the total number of intersections on the chessboard.
