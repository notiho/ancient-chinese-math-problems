今有玉方一寸，重七兩；石方一寸，重六兩。今有石立方三寸，中有玉，并重十一斤。問︰玉、石重各幾何？
術曰：假令皆玉，多十三兩。令之皆石，不足十四兩。不足為玉，多為石。各以一寸之重乘之，得玉石之積重。
荅曰：玉 a寸 ，重 b斤 。石 c寸 ，重 d斤 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the weights of jade ("玉") and stone ("石") in a cube with a side length of 3 inches, where the total weight is 11 pounds. The weights per cubic inch are given as 7 taels for jade and 6 taels for stone. 

We will use the following units:
- 1 pound = 16 taels.

The solution involves setting up equations based on the given conditions and solving for the unknowns.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
jade_weight_per_cubic_inch = 7  # taels
stone_weight_per_cubic_inch = 6  # taels
total_weight = 11 * 16  # Convert total weight to taels (11 pounds = 11 * 16 taels)
total_volume = 3 ** 3  # Total volume in cubic inches

# Let the volume of jade be "a" cubic inches, and the volume of stone be "c" cubic inches.
# Then, a + c = total_volume.
# The total weight is given by: 7a + 6c = total_weight.

# Solve for "a" and "c"
# From a + c = total_volume, we can write c = total_volume - a.
# Substitute c into the weight equation: 7a + 6(total_volume - a) = total_weight.
# Simplify: 7a + 6total_volume - 6a = total_weight
#           a + 6total_volume = total_weight
#           a = total_weight - 6total_volume

a = total_weight - 6 * total_volume
a = Fraction(a, 1)  # Convert to a fraction for precision

# Solve for "c"
c = total_volume - a

# Calculate the weights of jade and stone
b = jade_weight_per_cubic_inch * a  # Weight of jade in taels
d = stone_weight_per_cubic_inch * c  # Weight of stone in taels

# Convert weights to pounds
b = b / 16  # Convert taels to pounds
d = d / 16  # Convert taels to pounds

# Results
a = float(a)  # Volume of jade in cubic inches
b = float(b)  # Weight of jade in pounds
c = float(c)  # Volume of stone in cubic inches
d = float(d)  # Weight of stone in pounds


"""


The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` represent the solution:
- `a`: Volume of jade in cubic inches.
- `b`: Weight of jade in pounds.
- `c`: Volume of stone in cubic inches.
- `d`: Weight of stone in pounds.
