今有田廣一里，從一里。問：為田幾何？
里田術曰：廣從里數相乘得積里。以三百七十五乘之，即畝數。
荅曰： a頃 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the area of a field in "頃" (qing), given that the field is 1 li wide and 1 li long. The conversion factor is provided: multiplying the area in square li by 375 gives the area in 畝 (mu), and 100 畝 equals 1 頃 (qing).

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given dimensions of the field
width_li = 1  # in li
length_li = 1  # in li

# Step 1: Calculate the area in square li
area_square_li = width_li * length_li  # in square li

# Step 2: Convert square li to mu (1 square li = 375 mu)
area_mu = area_square_li * 375  # in mu

# Step 3: Convert mu to qing (100 mu = 1 qing)
a = Fraction(area_mu, 100)  # in qing

# The result is stored in variable 'a'


"""


The solution is stored in the variable `a`, which represents the area of the field in "頃" (qing).
