又有田廣五分步之四，從九分步之五，問：為田幾何？
乘分術曰：母相乘為法，子相乘為實，實如法而一。
荅曰： a步 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to compute the area of the field (田). The problem states that the field's dimensions are given as fractions of steps: one side is \( \frac{4}{5} \) of a step, and the other side is \( \frac{5}{9} \) of a step. The area of the field is calculated by multiplying these two fractions together.

Here is the Python code to compute the value of \( a \), the area of the field:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Dimensions of the field
side1 = Fraction(4, 5)  # 4/5 steps
side2 = Fraction(5, 9)  # 5/9 steps

# Calculate the area
a = side1 * side2  # Area in square steps

# The result is stored in the variable 'a'


"""


The value of \( a \) will represent the area of the field in square steps.
