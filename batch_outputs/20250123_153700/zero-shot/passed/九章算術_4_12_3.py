This problem describes a method for finding the square root of a given area (積) to determine the side length (步) of a square. The ancient Chinese algorithm for square root extraction is described in detail. Let's translate this into Python code to compute the side length `a` (步).

We will use the `Fraction` class from the `fractions` module to handle numbers that might not be integers.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given area (積)
area = Fraction(25281)  # 二萬五千二百八十一步

# Step 1: Initialize variables
a = 0  # This will store the side length (步)
remainder = area  # Start with the full area as the remainder
place_value = 1  # Place value for the current digit being calculated

# Step 2: Iteratively extract the square root
while remainder > 0:
    # Double the current side length (a) and multiply by the place value
    trial_divisor = 2 * a * place_value
    
    # Find the largest digit (d) such that (trial_divisor + d * place_value) * d <= remainder
    d = 0
    while (trial_divisor + d * place_value) * d <= remainder:
        d += 1
    d -= 1  # Step back to the largest valid digit
    
    # Update the side length (a) and the remainder
    a = a * 10 + d  # Append the digit to the side length
    remainder -= (trial_divisor + d * place_value) * d  # Subtract the square of the current digit
    
    # Update the place value for the next digit
    place_value *= 10

# The final value of `a` is the side length (步)
print(f"a = {a} 步")


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input:** The given area (積) is `25281`. This is represented as a `Fraction` to handle any potential fractional results.
2. **Initialization:** Variables are initialized:
   - `a` starts at 0 and will store the computed side length (步).
   - `remainder` starts as the full area and is reduced iteratively.
   - `place_value` tracks the current place value for the digit being calculated.
3. **Square Root Extraction:** The algorithm iteratively calculates each digit of the square root:
   - It doubles the current side length (`a`) and calculates the trial divisor.
   - It finds the largest digit (`d`) such that adding this digit to the side length still keeps the square within the remainder.
   - It updates the side length (`a`) and subtracts the square of the current digit from the remainder.
   - It increases the place value for the next digit.
4. **Output:** The final value of `a` is printed as the side length in 步.

### Result:
Running the code will compute the side length `a` in 步 for the given area.
