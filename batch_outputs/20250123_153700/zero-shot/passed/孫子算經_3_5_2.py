今有租，九萬八千七百六十二斛，欲以一車載五十斛。問：用車幾何？
術曰：置租九萬八千七百六十二斛為實，以一車所載五十斛為法。實如法，即得。
答曰： a乘 奇 b斛 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many carts are required to transport 98,762斛 of grain, given that each cart can carry 50斛. The solution involves dividing the total amount of grain by the capacity of one cart.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_grain = 98762  # in 斛
cart_capacity = 50  # in 斛

# Calculate the number of carts needed
a = total_grain // cart_capacity  # Integer part (whole carts)
b = total_grain % cart_capacity  # Remaining grain (in 斛)

# Results
a = Fraction(a)  # Convert to Fraction for consistency
b = Fraction(b)  # Convert to Fraction for consistency


"""


After running this code:
- `a` will represent the number of full carts required.
- `b` will represent the remaining grain (in 斛) that cannot fill a full cart.
