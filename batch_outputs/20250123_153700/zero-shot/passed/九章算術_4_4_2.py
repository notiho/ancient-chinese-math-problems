今有田廣一步半、三分步之一、四分步之一、五分步之一、六分步之一。求田一畝，問︰從幾何？
術曰：下有六分，以一為一百二十，半為六十，三分之一為四十，四分之一為三十，五分之一為二十四，六分之一為二十，并之得二百九十四以為法。置田二百四十步，亦以一為一百二十乘之，為實。實如法得從步。
荅曰： a步 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the number of steps (`a`) in a field based on the given proportions and units.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
unit = 120  # One step is equivalent to 120 units
field_area = 240  # The field is 240 steps

# Proportions of the step
half_step = Fraction(1, 2) * unit
third_step = Fraction(1, 3) * unit
quarter_step = Fraction(1, 4) * unit
fifth_step = Fraction(1, 5) * unit
sixth_step = Fraction(1, 6) * unit

# Total value of one step
one_step_value = unit + half_step + third_step + quarter_step + fifth_step + sixth_step

# Calculate the number of steps (a)
a = Fraction(field_area * unit, one_step_value)

# Output the result
a


"""


### Explanation:
1. Each step is divided into parts: 1 (whole step), 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, and 1/6.
2. The total value of one step (`one_step_value`) is calculated by summing these parts.
3. The field area is given as 240 steps, and each step is equivalent to 120 units.
4. To find the number of steps (`a`), we multiply the field area by the unit value and divide it by the total value of one step.

### Result:
The variable `a` will contain the number of steps as a `Fraction`.
