To solve this problem, we will calculate the total number of characters (字) in the Buddhist text. The problem states that there are 29 chapters (章), and each chapter contains 63 characters (字). The solution involves multiplying the number of chapters by the number of characters per chapter.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
chapters = 29  # Number of chapters
characters_per_chapter = 63  # Characters per chapter

# Calculation
a = chapters * characters_per_chapter  # Total number of characters

# Result
a


"""


The variable `a` will contain the total number of characters in the text.
