又有田廣五分步之四，從九分步之五，問：為田幾何？
乘分術曰：母相乘為法，子相乘為實，實如法而一。
荅曰： a步 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves fractions and multiplication. Here's the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given fractions
fraction1 = Fraction(4, 5)  # 4/5
fraction2 = Fraction(5, 9)  # 5/9

# Multiply the fractions
a = fraction1 * fraction2

# The result is stored in variable 'a'
a  # This represents the answer in 步 (steps)


"""


The value of `a` will be the solution to the problem in terms of 步 (steps).
