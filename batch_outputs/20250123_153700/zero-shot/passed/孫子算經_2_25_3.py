今有女子善織，日自倍，五日織通五尺。問：日織幾何？
術曰：各置列衰副，并得三十一為法，以五尺乘并者，各自為實，實如法而一，即得。
答曰：初日織 a寸 ，次日織 b寸 ，次日織 c寸 ，次日織 d尺 ，次日織 e尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem describes a scenario where a woman weaves cloth, doubling her output each day, and completes 5 feet of cloth in 5 days. We need to find how much she weaves each day.

The solution involves calculating the amount woven each day, starting with the first day (a寸), second day (b寸), third day (c寸), fourth day (d尺), and fifth day (e尺). The total is 5 feet (5尺), and the output doubles each day.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total woven in 5 days is 5尺 (5 feet)
total_woven = 5  # in 尺

# Let the amount woven on the first day be a寸 (a in inches)
# 1尺 = 10寸, so we convert everything to寸 for calculation
# Day 1: a寸
# Day 2: 2a寸
# Day 3: 4a寸
# Day 4: 8a寸
# Day 5: 16a寸
# Total: a + 2a + 4a + 8a + 16a = 31a寸

# Convert total_woven to寸
total_woven_in_cun = total_woven * 10  # 1尺 = 10寸

# Solve for a
a = Fraction(total_woven_in_cun, 31)  # a寸

# Calculate the amount woven each day
b = 2 * a  # b寸
c = 4 * a  # c寸
d = Fraction(8 * a, 10)  # d尺 (convert寸 to尺)
e = Fraction(16 * a, 10)  # e尺 (convert寸 to尺)

# Results
a, b, c, d, e


"""


### Explanation:
1. The total woven in 5 days is given as 5尺 (5 feet). We convert this to寸 (inches) for calculation since 1尺 = 10寸.
2. The amount woven each day doubles: a寸, 2a寸, 4a寸, 8a寸, 16a寸.
3. The total woven in寸 is `31a寸`, so we solve for `a` by dividing the total woven in寸 by 31.
4. Using `a`, we calculate the amounts woven on subsequent days (`b`, `c`, `d`, `e`), converting寸 to尺 where necessary.

### Output:
The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` will contain the amounts woven each day in寸 or尺 as appropriate.
