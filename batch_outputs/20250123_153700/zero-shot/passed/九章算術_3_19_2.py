今有貸人千錢，月息三十。今有貸人七百五十錢，九日歸之，問︰息幾何？
術曰：以月三十日，乘千錢為法。以息三十乘今所貸錢數，又以九日乘之，為實。實如法得一錢。
荅曰： a錢 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the interest (息) for a loan based on the given conditions.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
loan_amount = 750  # The amount of money loaned (in 錢)
interest_rate_per_month = 30  # Interest rate per month (in 錢)
loan_duration_days = 9  # Duration of the loan (in days)
days_in_month = 30  # Number of days in a month

# Calculation
a = Fraction(interest_rate_per_month * loan_amount * loan_duration_days, days_in_month * 1000)

# The answer
a  # This represents the interest (息) in 錢


"""


The solution for the interest (息) is stored in the variable `a`.
