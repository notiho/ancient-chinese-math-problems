To solve this problem, we need to compute the area of the field given two fractional dimensions. The problem states that the field has a width of \( \frac{4}{7} \) steps and a length of \( \frac{3}{5} \) steps. The area is calculated by multiplying these two fractions.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Dimensions of the field
width = Fraction(4, 7)  # 4/7 steps
length = Fraction(3, 5)  # 3/5 steps

# Calculate the area
a = width * length  # Area in square steps

# The result is stored in variable 'a'


"""


The value of `a` will represent the area of the field in square steps.
