"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice rent owed by 2,700 households, where each household owes 15 hu (斛) of rice. Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
households = 2700  # Number of households
rent_per_household = 15  # Rent in hu per household

# Calculation
a = households * rent_per_household  # Total rent in hu

# Result
a  # a is the total rent in hu


"""


The answer is stored in the variable `a`, which represents the total rent in hu (斛).
