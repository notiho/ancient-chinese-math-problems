今有鳧起南海，七日至北海；鴈起北海，九日至南海。今鳧鴈俱起。問︰何日相逢？
術曰：并日數為法，日數相乘為實，實如法得一日。
荅曰： a日 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves two birds, a duck ("鳧") and a goose ("鴈"), traveling between the South Sea and the North Sea. The duck takes 7 days to travel from the South Sea to the North Sea, while the goose takes 9 days to travel from the North Sea to the South Sea. We are tasked with finding the number of days ("a") it takes for the two birds to meet if they start traveling simultaneously.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
duck_days = 7  # Days for the duck to travel from South Sea to North Sea
goose_days = 9  # Days for the goose to travel from North Sea to South Sea

# Compute the meeting day
a = Fraction(duck_days * goose_days, duck_days + goose_days)

# The solution is stored in the variable "a"
a  # a is the number of days until they meet


"""


The value of `a` will be the number of days it takes for the duck and the goose to meet.
