今有二千七百户，户責租米一十五斛。問：計㡬何？

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice rent ("租米") owed by 2,700 households ("二千七百户"), where each household owes 15 hu ("一十五斛"). The solution is straightforward: multiply the number of households by the rent owed per household.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
households = 2700  # 二千七百户
rent_per_household = 15  # 一十五斛

# Calculation
a = households * rent_per_household  # Total rent in hu (斛)

# Result
a  # a斛


"""


The variable `a` will hold the total rent in hu (斛).
