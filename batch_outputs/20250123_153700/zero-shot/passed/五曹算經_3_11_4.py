又有席，一領坐客一十五人，有客四萬四千六百二十五人。問：席㡬何？
術曰：列四萬四千六百二十五人，以一十五人除之即得。
答曰： a領 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to compute the number of席 ("seats") required to accommodate 44,625 guests, where each席 can seat 15 people. Here's the Python code to compute the value of `a`:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_guests = 44625  # Total number of guests
seats_per_seat = 15   # Number of guests per seat

# Compute the number of seats required
a = total_guests // seats_per_seat  # Integer division since seats must be whole

# Result
a  # Number of seats


"""


The value of `a` will be the number of席 required.
