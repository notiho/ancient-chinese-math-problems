今有鳧起南海，七日至北海；鴈起北海，九日至南海。今鳧鴈俱起。問︰何日相逢？
術曰：并日數為法，日數相乘為實，實如法得一日。
荅曰： a日 。

This problem involves determining when two birds, a duck (鳧) and a goose (鴈), starting from opposite ends (South Sea and North Sea, respectively), will meet if they travel towards each other. The duck takes 7 days to travel from the South Sea to the North Sea, and the goose takes 9 days to travel from the North Sea to the South Sea.

The solution involves finding the time it takes for them to meet, which is calculated using the formula provided in the problem:

1. Add the total days it takes for each bird to complete its journey (7 + 9).
2. Multiply the total days of each bird's journey (7 * 9).
3. Divide the product by the sum to find the meeting time.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Days it takes for the duck and goose to complete their journeys
duck_days = 7
goose_days = 9

# Compute the meeting time
a = Fraction(duck_days * goose_days, duck_days + goose_days)

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'
a  # This represents the number of days until they meet


"""


The variable `a` will contain the result as a `Fraction` representing the number of days until the duck and goose meet.
