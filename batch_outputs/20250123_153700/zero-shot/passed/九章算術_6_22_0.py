今有一人一日矯矢五十，一人一日羽矢三十，一人一日筈矢十五。今令一人一日自矯、羽、筈，問︰成矢幾何？
術曰：矯矢五十，用徒一人。羽矢五十，用徒一人、太半人。筈矢五十，用徒三人、少半人。并之，得六人，以為法。以五十矢為實。實如法得一矢。
荅曰： a矢 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating how many arrows ("a") a single person can complete in one day if they perform all three tasks (矯矢, 羽矢, 筈矢) themselves.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Define the rates of work for each task
矯矢_rate = Fraction(50, 1)  # One person can straighten 50 arrows in one day
羽矢_rate = Fraction(30, 1)  # One person can feather 30 arrows in one day
筈矢_rate = Fraction(15, 1)  # One person can notch 15 arrows in one day

# Calculate the total work required for 50 arrows
矯矢_people = Fraction(50, 矯矢_rate)  # People needed to straighten 50 arrows
羽矢_people = Fraction(50, 羽矢_rate)  # People needed to feather 50 arrows
筈矢_people = Fraction(50, 筈矢_rate)  # People needed to notch 50 arrows

# Total people required to complete 50 arrows
total_people = 矯矢_people + 羽矢_people + 筈矢_people

# Calculate the number of arrows one person can complete in one day
a = Fraction(50, total_people)

# The result
a


"""


The variable `a` will contain the number of arrows a single person can complete in one day.
