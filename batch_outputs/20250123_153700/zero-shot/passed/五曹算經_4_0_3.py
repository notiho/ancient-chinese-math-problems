"""
To solve this problem, we calculate the total amount of rice rent owed by multiplying the number of households (2700) by the rent per household (15 hu). Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
households = 2700  # number of households
rent_per_household = 15  # rent in hu per household

# Calculation
a = households * rent_per_household  # total rent in hu

# Result
a  # a is in hu


"""


The value of `a` will represent the total rent in hu.
