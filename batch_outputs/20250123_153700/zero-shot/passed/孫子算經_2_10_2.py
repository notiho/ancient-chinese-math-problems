今有方窖，廣四丈六尺，長五丈四尺，深三丈五尺。問：受粟幾何？
術曰：置廣四丈六尺，長五丈四尺，相乘得二千四百八十四尺；以深三丈五尺乘之，得八萬六千九百四十尺，以斛法一尺六寸二分除之，即得。
答曰： a斛 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of the rectangular pit (方窖) and then convert the volume into the number of "斛" (a unit of measurement for grain). Here's how we can translate the problem into Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Dimensions of the pit in 尺 (1 丈 = 10 尺)
width = 4 * 10 + 6  # 4 丈 6 尺
length = 5 * 10 + 4  # 5 丈 4 尺
depth = 3 * 10 + 5  # 3 丈 5 尺

# Volume of the pit in cubic 尺
volume = width * length * depth

# Conversion factor: 1 斛 = 1 尺 6 寸 2 分 = 1 + 6/10 + 2/100 = 1.62 尺
conversion_factor = Fraction(162, 100)

# Calculate the number of 斛
a = volume / conversion_factor

# Result
a


"""


### Explanation:
1. The dimensions of the pit are given in 丈 and 尺. We first convert them entirely into 尺.
2. The volume of the pit is calculated as `width * length * depth`.
3. The conversion factor for 1 斛 is given as 1 尺 6 寸 2 分, which is equivalent to 1.62 尺.
4. Finally, we divide the volume by the conversion factor to find the number of 斛.

The variable `a` will contain the answer in terms of 斛.
