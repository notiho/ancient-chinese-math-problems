The extra length of the rope is `4\u5c3a5\u5bf8`, which is converted to `4 + 5/10 = 4.5 \u5c3a`.\n2. The shortfall when the rope is bent is `1\u5c3a`.\n3. Adding these together gives the total length of the rope when straightened: `4.5 + 1 = 5.5 \u5c3a`.\n4. Doubling this total length gives `11 \u5c3a`.\n5. Subtracting the extra length (`4.5 \u5c3a`) from the doubled length gives the actual length of the wood: `11 - 4.5 = 6.5 \u5c3a`.\n\nThe value of `a` is `6.5 \u5c3a`.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 175, "completion_tokens": 1126, "total_tokens": 1301, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_60a3f2dc65"}}, "error": null}
