Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Let the number of cars be `a`.\n2. Let the number of people be `b`.\n\nFrom the problem:\n- When 3 people share a car, 2 cars are empty. This means the total number of cars is `a`, and the total number of people is `b`. Thus, the number of cars used is `b / 3`, and the number of empty cars is `a - b / 3`. From the problem, we know that `a - b / 3 = 2`.\n  \n- When 2 people share a car, 9 people are walking. This means the total number of people is `b`, and the number of cars used is `b / 2`. From the problem, we know that the number of walking people is `b - 2 * (b / 2) = 9`.\n\nWe now solve these equations to find `a` (cars) and `b` (people).\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Equation 1: a - b / 3 = 2\n# Equation 2: b - 2 * (b / 2) = 9\n\n# Solve Equation 2 for b:\n# b - b = 9\n# b = 18\nb = 18\n\n# Substitute b into Equation 1 to solve for a:\n# a - b / 3 = 2\n# a = 2 + b / 3\na = 2 + Fraction(b, 3)\n\n# Results\na, b\n```\n\nThe solution is:\n- `a` (number of cars) = 8\n- `b` (number of people) = 18", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 168, "completion_tokens": 1656, "total_tokens": 1824, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ec7eab8ec3"}}, "error": null}
