Using the given information, we can calculate `a` as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Total number of people required to produce 50 arrows for each task\n\u77ef_people = Fraction(1)  # 1 person for \u77ef\u77e2\n\u7fbd_people = Fraction(3, 2)  # 1.5 people for \u7fbd\u77e2\n\u7b48_people = Fraction(7, 2)  # 3.5 people for \u7b48\u77e2\n\n# Total people required to produce 50 arrows for all tasks\ntotal_people = \u77ef_people + \u7fbd_people + \u7b48_people\n\n# Total arrows produced by one person in one day\na = Fraction(50) / total_people\n\n# Output the result\na\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. We calculate the total number of people required to produce 50 arrows for all tasks: `1 + 1.5 + 3.5 = 6`.\n2. Since 50 arrows are produced by 6 people in one day, the number of arrows one person can produce in one day is `50 / 6`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```python\na\u77e2 = Fraction(50, 6)  # Simplified to Fraction(25, 3)\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 4, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code.
