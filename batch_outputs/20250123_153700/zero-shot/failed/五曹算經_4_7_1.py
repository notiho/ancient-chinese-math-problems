To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of a storage space and then convert it into a specific unit of measurement (斛). The dimensions of the storage space are given in terms of 尺 (Chinese feet), and the conversion factor is also provided.

Here is the Python code to compute the values of `a` (斛) and `b` (分):


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Dimensions of the storage space in 尺
length = Fraction(1, 1) * 19  # 1丈9尺 = 19尺
width = Fraction(1, 1) * 15  # 1丈5尺 = 15尺
height = Fraction(1, 1) * 13  # 1丈3尺 = 13尺

# Conversion factor: 1斛 = 1尺6寸2分 = 1尺 + 6/10尺 + 2/100尺
conversion_factor = Fraction(1, 1) + Fraction(6, 10) + Fraction(2, 100)

# Calculate the volume in cubic 尺
volume = length * width * height

# Convert the volume into 斛
total_hu = volume / conversion_factor

# Separate the integer part (a斛) and the fractional part (b分)
a = total_hu.numerator // total_hu.denominator  # Integer part (斛)
b = (total_hu - a) * 100  # Fractional part (分)

# Ensure b is an integer
b = b.numerator // b.denominator

# Results
a, b


"""


### Explanation:
1. The dimensions of the storage space are converted into 尺.
2. The volume is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.
3. The conversion factor for 1斛 is given as 1尺6寸2分, which is converted into a fraction in terms of 尺.
4. The total volume in cubic 尺 is divided by the conversion factor to get the total number of 斛.
5. The integer part of the result is `a` (斛), and the fractional part is converted into 分 by multiplying by 100.

### Output:
The variables `a` and `b` will contain the solution:
- `a` is the number of 斛.
- `b` is the number of 分.
