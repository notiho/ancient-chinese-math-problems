今有共買牛，七家共出一百九十，不足三百三十；九家共出二百七十，盈三十。問︰家數、牛價各幾何？
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰： a家 ，牛價 b 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the number of families (`a`) and the price of a cow (`b`). Here's the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
rate1 = 7  # Seven families
rate2 = 9  # Nine families
total1 = 190  # Total money contributed by 7 families
total2 = 270  # Total money contributed by 9 families
deficit = 330 - total1  # Deficit when 7 families contribute
surplus = total2 - 300  # Surplus when 9 families contribute

# Compute the unknowns
# According to the method:
# Multiply the rates by their respective contributions and sum them
numerator = (rate1 * total2) - (rate2 * total1)
denominator = (rate1 * surplus) + (rate2 * deficit)

# The price of a cow (b) is the numerator divided by the denominator
b = Fraction(numerator, denominator)

# The number of families (a) is the total money contributed by one group divided by the price of a cow
a = Fraction(total1, b)

# Results
a, b


"""


This code computes the number of families (`a`) and the price of a cow (`b`) using the ancient Chinese method described. The results will be stored in the variables `a` and `b` as fractions.
