"""
今有粟五斗、太半升，欲為麻。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求菽、答、麻、麥，皆九之，十而一。
荅曰：為麻 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to compute the amount of 麻 (hemp) that can be obtained from 粟 (millet). The rule provided states that to convert 粟 into 麻, we multiply the amount of 粟 by 9/10.

The given amount of 粟 is 5斗 and 太半升. 太半升 means "greater half of a 升," which is equivalent to 6/10升. Therefore, the total amount of 粟 is 5斗 + 6/10升.

Since 1斗 = 10升, we first convert everything into 升 for easier calculation:
5斗 = 50升.

Thus, the total 粟 in 升 is:
50升 + 6/10升 = 50.6升.

Now, to compute the amount of 麻, we multiply the total 粟 by 9/10.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
粟_in_斗 = 5
粟_in_升 = Fraction(6, 10)  # 太半升 = 6/10升

# Convert 粟 to 升
粟_total_升 = 粟_in_斗 * 10 + 粟_in_升  # 1斗 = 10升

# Conversion rule: 粟 to 麻 is 9/10
conversion_ratio = Fraction(9, 10)
a = 粟_total_升 * conversion_ratio  # Amount of 麻 in 升

# Output the result
a  # This is the amount of 麻 in 升


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 麻 in 升.

"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 114/25, Actual: 2277/50"""
