今有戶高多於廣六尺八寸，兩隅相去適一丈。問︰戶高、廣各幾何？
術曰：令一丈自乘為實。半相多，令自乘，倍之，減實，半其餘。以開方除之，所得，減相多之半，即戶廣。加相多之半，即戶高。
荅曰：廣 a尺 ；高 b尺 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the height (`b`) and width (`a`) of a door given certain conditions. Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
difference = Fraction(6, 1) + Fraction(8, 10)  # 6尺8寸 = 6 + 8/10 尺
diagonal = Fraction(10, 1)  # 1丈 = 10尺

# Step 1: Let the diagonal squared be the "實" (diagonal^2)
diagonal_squared = diagonal ** 2

# Step 2: Half the difference (相多)
half_difference = difference / 2

# Step 3: Square the half difference and double it
half_difference_squared_doubled = 2 * (half_difference ** 2)

# Step 4: Subtract the squared half difference doubled from the diagonal squared
remaining = diagonal_squared - half_difference_squared_doubled

# Step 5: Take the square root of the remaining (開方)
# Since we are working with fractions, we compute the square root manually
square_root_remaining = remaining ** Fraction(1, 2)

# Step 6: Divide the square root by 2 (半其餘)
half_square_root = square_root_remaining / 2

# Step 7: Compute the width (廣, a) and height (高, b)
a = half_square_root - half_difference  # Width
b = half_square_root + half_difference  # Height

# Results
a, b

The variables `a` and `b` will contain the width and height of the door in 尺 (Chinese feet).
