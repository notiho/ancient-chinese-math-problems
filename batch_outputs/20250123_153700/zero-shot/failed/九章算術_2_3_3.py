今有粟七斗九升，欲為御米。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求御米，二十一之，五十而一。
荅曰：為御米 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to convert 粟 (common millet) into 御米 (imperial rice) using the given ratio: 21 units of 粟 are equivalent to 1 unit of 御米. The total amount of 粟 is 7斗9升, and we need to compute the equivalent amount of 御米.

In ancient Chinese measurements:
- 1斗 = 10升.

Thus, 7斗9升 = \( 7 \times 10 + 9 = 79 \)升.

The conversion ratio is \( 21 \) units of 粟 to \( 1 \) unit of 御米. Therefore, the amount of 御米 is calculated as:

\[
\text{御米} = \frac{\text{粟 (in 升)}}{21}.
\]

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total 粟 in 升
total_corn = 7 * 10 + 9  # 7斗9升 = 79升

# Conversion ratio: 21 units of 粟 = 1 unit of 御米
a = Fraction(total_corn, 21)  # 御米 in 斗

# Result
a  # a is the amount of 御米 in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will store the amount of 御米 in 斗 as a fraction.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 1659/500, Actual: 79/21"""
