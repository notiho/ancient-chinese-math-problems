今有豆八百四十九斛，凡豆九斗易麻七斗。問：得麻㡬何？
術曰：列豆八百四十九斛，以七十乘之得五萬九千四百三十斛，以九十除之即得。
答曰： a斛 奇 b升 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem states that 849斛 of beans can be exchanged for 麻 (hemp) at a rate of 9斗 of beans for 7斗 of hemp. We need to find how much hemp (麻) can be obtained, expressed in terms of 斛 and 升.

1斛 = 10斗, and 1斗 = 10升.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
beans = 849  # in 斛
exchange_rate_beans = 9  # in 斗
exchange_rate_hemp = 7  # in 斗

# Convert beans to 斗
beans_in_dou = beans * 10  # 1斛 = 10斗

# Calculate the amount of hemp in 斗
hemp_in_dou = Fraction(beans_in_dou * exchange_rate_hemp, exchange_rate_beans)

# Convert hemp to 斛 and 升
a = hemp_in_dou // 10  # Integer part in 斛
b = (hemp_in_dou % 10) * 10  # Remaining part in 升

# Results
a = int(a)  # 斛
b = int(b)  # 升


"""


After running this code, the variables `a` and `b` will contain the solution:

- `a` is the number of 斛 of hemp.
- `b` is the number of 升 of hemp.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 660333/1000, Actual: 660
Variable 'b' has wrong value. Expected: 3, Actual: 33"""
