假令有粟五千一百四十石，欲作方窖、圓窖各一，令口小底大，方面於圓徑等，兩深亦同，其深少於下方七尺，多於上方一丈四尺，盛各滿中而粟適盡。問：方、徑、深各多少？
術曰：以四十二乘斛法，以乘粟，七十五而一，為方亭積。令方差自乘，三而一，為隅陽冪，以截多乘之，減積，余為實。以多乘差，加冪，為方法。多加差，為廉法，從。開立方除之，即上方。加差，即合所問。
答曰：上方徑各 a尺 ，下方徑各 b丈 ，深各 c丈 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the dimensions of square and circular silos based on the given conditions. Let's compute the values of the unknowns `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_grain = 5140  # in 石
square_silo_factor = 42
circular_silo_factor = 75
depth_difference = Fraction(7, 10)  # 7尺 = 7/10丈
depth_sum = Fraction(14, 10)  # 1丈4尺 = 14/10丈

# Step 1: Calculate the depth of the silos
# Let the depth of the square silo be c (in 丈)
# Then the depth of the circular silo is c + depth_difference
# The total depth is c + (c + depth_difference) = depth_sum
c = (depth_sum - depth_difference) / 2

# Step 2: Calculate the dimensions of the silos
# Let the side length of the square silo be a (in 尺)
# Let the diameter of the circular silo be b (in 丈)
# The volume of the square silo is proportional to a^2 * c
# The volume of the circular silo is proportional to (b^2 / 4) * π * (c + depth_difference)
# The total volume is proportional to the total grain

# Using the given factors, we can write:
# square_silo_factor * a^2 * c + circular_silo_factor * (b^2 / 4) * π * (c + depth_difference) = total_grain

# Simplify the equation:
# a^2 * c / 75 + b^2 * (c + depth_difference) / 300 = total_grain / 42

# Solve for a and b
# Assume a = b (since the problem states "方面於圓徑等")
# Let a = b = x (in 尺 for a, in 丈 for b)
# Convert b to 尺: b = 10 * x (since 1丈 = 10尺)

# Substitute into the equation:
# x^2 * c / 75 + (10 * x)^2 * (c + depth_difference) / 300 = total_grain / 42

# Simplify:
# x^2 * c / 75 + 100 * x^2 * (c + depth_difference) / 300 = total_grain / 42

# Combine terms:
# x^2 * (c / 75 + 100 * (c + depth_difference) / 300) = total_grain / 42

# Simplify further:
# x^2 * (c / 75 + (c + depth_difference) / 3) = total_grain / 42

# Solve for x^2:
x_squared = (total_grain / 42) / (c / 75 + (c + depth_difference) / 3)

# Calculate x:
x = x_squared ** Fraction(1, 2)

# Assign values to a, b, and c
a = x  # in 尺
b = x / 10  # in 丈
c = c  # in 丈

# Results
a, b, c

### Explanation:
1. **Depth Calculation (`c`)**: The depth of the square silo (`c`) and the circular silo (`c + depth_difference`) must sum to `depth_sum`. Solving this gives the depth of each silo.
2. **Volume Equation**: The total volume of the silos is proportional to the total grain. Using the given factors, we set up an equation to relate the dimensions of the silos to the total grain.
3. **Assumption (`a = b`)**: The problem states that the side length of the square silo is equal to the diameter of the circular silo. This simplifies the equation.
4. **Solve for `x`**: By substituting `a = b = x`, we solve for `x` (in 尺) and then calculate `a`, `b`, and `c`.

The final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be stored in the respective variables.
