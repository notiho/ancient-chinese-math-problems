今有生絲三十斤，乾之，耗三斤十二兩。今有乾絲一十二斤，問︰生絲幾何？
術曰：置生絲兩數，除耗數，餘，以為法。三十斤乘乾絲兩數為實。實如法得生絲數。
荅曰： a斤 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. Here's the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
initial_raw_silk = 30  # in jin
loss_raw_silk = Fraction(3, 1) + Fraction(12, 16)  # 3 jin 12 liang (16 liang = 1 jin)
final_dry_silk = 12  # in jin

# Calculation
# Remaining raw silk after drying = initial_raw_silk - loss_raw_silk
remaining_raw_silk = initial_raw_silk - loss_raw_silk

# Ratio of dry silk to raw silk
ratio_dry_to_raw = Fraction(final_dry_silk, remaining_raw_silk)

# Calculate the amount of raw silk needed for 12 jin of dry silk
a = Fraction(final_dry_silk, ratio_dry_to_raw)

# Result
a  # in jin


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of raw silk (in jin) required to produce 12 jin of dry silk.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 96/7, Actual: 105/4"""
