今有粟一斗，欲為小䵂。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求小䵂，二十七之，百而一。
荅曰：為小䵂 a升 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, let's translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem states that 1斗 of 粟 (grain) can be converted into 小䵂 (a smaller unit of measurement). The conversion rate is given as 27小䵂 per 100斗. We need to calculate how many 小䵂 are obtained from 1斗.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
粟 = 1  # 粟 in 斗
conversion_rate = Fraction(27, 100)  # 27小䵂 per 100斗

# Calculation
a = 粟 * conversion_rate  # 小䵂 obtained from 1斗

# Result
a  # This is the answer in 小䵂


"""


The variable `a` will contain the result in terms of 小䵂.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 27/10, Actual: 27/100"""
