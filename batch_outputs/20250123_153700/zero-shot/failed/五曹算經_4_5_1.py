今有方窖從一丈三尺廣六尺深一丈。問：受粟㡬何？
術曰：列從一丈三尺以廣六尺乘之得七十八尺以深一丈乘之得七百八十尺以斛法除之即得。
答曰： a斛 奇 b寸 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of a rectangular pit and convert it into a specific unit of measurement, "斛" (a traditional Chinese unit of volume). The dimensions of the pit are given in terms of "丈" and "尺," where 1 丈 = 10 尺. The final answer should be expressed in terms of "斛" and "寸," where 1 斛 = 10 尺³.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Dimensions of the pit
length = Fraction(1, 1) * 10 + 3  # 1 丈 3 尺 = 10 尺 + 3 尺
width = Fraction(6, 1)  # 6 尺
depth = Fraction(1, 1) * 10  # 1 丈 = 10 尺

# Volume in cubic 尺
volume_cubic_chi = length * width * depth

# Conversion: 1 斛 = 10 cubic 尺
a = volume_cubic_chi // 10  # Number of 斛
b = volume_cubic_chi % 10  # Remaining 尺³ (寸)

# Results
a = int(a)  # Convert to integer for clarity
b = int(b)  # Convert to integer for clarity

# The answer is stored in variables a (斛) and b (寸)


"""


### Explanation:
1. The dimensions of the pit are converted into 尺 (chi) since 1 丈 = 10 尺.
2. The volume is calculated in cubic 尺 by multiplying the length, width, and depth.
3. The volume is then converted into "斛" and "寸" using the fact that 1 斛 = 10 cubic 尺.
4. The final result is stored in variables `a` (number of 斛) and `b` (remaining cubic 尺, or寸).
