"""
今有粟八斗六升，欲為鑿飯。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求鑿飯，二十四之，二十五而一。
荅曰：為鑿飯 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of "鑿飯" (a斗) that can be made from 8斗6升 of 粟 (grain). The method provided states that to convert 粟 into 鑿飯, we divide the amount of 粟 by 24 and then multiply by 25.

### Assumptions:
1. 1斗 = 10升 (standard conversion in ancient Chinese measurements).
2. The total amount of 粟 is 8斗6升 = 8斗 + 6升 = \( 8 + \frac{6}{10} \) 斗 = \( \frac{86}{10} \) 斗.

### Formula:
\[
\text{鑿飯 (a斗)} = \text{粟 (斗)} \times \frac{25}{24}
\]

### Python Code:

"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total 粟 in 斗
grain = Fraction(86, 10)

# Conversion factor
conversion_factor = Fraction(25, 24)

# Calculate 鑿飯
a = grain * conversion_factor


"""


### Result:
The variable `a` will contain the amount of 鑿飯 in 斗 as a `Fraction`.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 1032/125, Actual: 215/24"""
