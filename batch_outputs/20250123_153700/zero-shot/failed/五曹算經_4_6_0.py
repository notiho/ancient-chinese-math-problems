To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the volume of a granary and subtracting the volumes of certain objects inside it. The final volume is then converted into units of "斛" and "寸". Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Dimensions of the granary
length = 130  # 1丈3尺 = 130寸
width = 60    # 6尺 = 60寸
height = 100  # 1丈 = 100寸

# Total volume of the granary
total_volume = length * width * height

# Volume of the two "牽" objects (each 5寸 square)
side_牽 = 5
volume_牽 = side_牽**2 * length * 2  # Two objects
volume_牽_total = volume_牽

# Volume of the three "横牽" objects (each 4寸 square)
side_横牽 = 4
volume_横牽 = side_横牽**2 * width * 3  # Three objects
volume_横牽_total = volume_横牽

# Volume of the single "柱" object (周3尺, 高1丈)
circumference_柱 = 30  # 3尺 = 30寸
radius_柱 = circumference_柱 / (2 * Fraction(22, 7))  # Using π ≈ 22/7
volume_柱 = Fraction(22, 7) * radius_柱**2 * height
volume_柱_total = volume_柱 / 12  # Dividing by 12 as per the problem

# Total volume of the objects inside the granary
total_objects_volume = volume_牽_total + volume_横牽_total + volume_柱_total

# Remaining volume of the granary
remaining_volume = total_volume - total_objects_volume

# Convert the remaining volume into "斛" and "寸"
斛_volume = 1620  # 1斛 = 1620寸³
a = remaining_volume // 斛_volume  # Number of "斛"
b = remaining_volume % 斛_volume  # Remaining "寸"

# Output the results
a = Fraction(a)
b = Fraction(b)

# The final result is stored in variables a and b

### Explanation:
1. **Granary Dimensions**: The granary's dimensions are converted into "寸" (smallest unit of measurement).
2. **Object Volumes**:
   - For the "牽" objects, the volume is calculated as the square of the side length multiplied by the granary's length and the number of objects.
   - For the "横牽" objects, the volume is calculated similarly but using the granary's width.
   - For the "柱" object, the volume is calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, with the circumference used to calculate the radius.
3. **Total Volume**: The total volume of the granary is calculated, and the volumes of the objects are subtracted.
4. **Conversion**: The remaining volume is converted into "斛" and "寸" using the given conversion factor (1斛 = 1620寸³).

The final answer is stored in variables `a` (number of "斛") and `b` (remaining "寸").
