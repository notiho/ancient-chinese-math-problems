"""
今有粟三斗少半升，欲為菽。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求菽、答、麻、麥，皆九之，十而一。
荅曰：為菽 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem states that we have 3斗 (dǒu) minus half a升 (shēng) of 粟 (sù, millet), and we want to convert it into 菽 (shū, beans). The conversion rule is that for 粟 to 菽, we multiply by 9/10.

Let's write the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
粟 = Fraction(3) - Fraction(1, 2)  # 3斗 minus half a升

# Conversion rule: multiply by 9/10
a = 粟 * Fraction(9, 10)

# Result
a  # This is the amount of 菽 in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will contain the result in terms of 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 273/100, Actual: 9/4"""
