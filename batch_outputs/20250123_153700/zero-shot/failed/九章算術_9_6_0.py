今有立木，繫索其末，委地三尺。引索卻行，去本八尺而索盡。問︰索長幾何？
術曰：以去本自乘，令如委數而一，所得，加委地數而半之，即索長
荅曰： a丈 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves a tree, a rope tied to its top, and some geometric relationships. The goal is to calculate the length of the rope.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
distance_from_base = Fraction(8)  # 去本, 8 尺
rope_on_ground = Fraction(3)  # 委地, 3 尺

# Calculation
a = (distance_from_base ** 2 + rope_on_ground ** 2) ** Fraction(1, 2)  # 索長 (a)

# Result
a  # Length of the rope in 尺


"""


The variable `a` will hold the length of the rope in 尺 (Chinese feet).
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 73/60, Actual: 8.54400374531753"""
