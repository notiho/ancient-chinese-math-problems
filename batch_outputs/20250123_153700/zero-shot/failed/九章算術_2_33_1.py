今有出錢五千七百八十五，買漆一斛六斗七升、太半升。欲斗率之，問︰斗幾何。
經術術曰：以所求率乘錢數為實，以所買率為法，實如法得一。
荅曰：一斗， a錢

"""
To solve this problem, we need to compute the cost of one斗 (dǒu) of lacquer. The total cost is 5785錢, and the total amount of lacquer purchased is 1斛6斗7升太半升. Let's first convert the total amount of lacquer into a single unit (斗), then calculate the cost per斗.

### Conversion factors:
1斛 = 10斗  
1斗 = 10升  
1升 = 2太半升  

### Steps:
1. Convert the total amount of lacquer into斗.
2. Use the formula provided:  
   \( \text{Cost per斗} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Total amount in斗}} \).

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total cost in 錢
total_cost = 5785

# Total amount of lacquer
hu = 1  # 1斛
dou = 6  # 6斗
sheng = 7  # 7升
tai_ban_sheng = Fraction(1, 2)  # 太半升 = 1/2升

# Convert everything to 斗
total_amount_in_dou = hu * 10 + dou + sheng / 10 + tai_ban_sheng / 10

# Calculate cost per 斗
a = Fraction(total_cost, total_amount_in_dou)

# The answer
a  # Cost per 斗 in 錢


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. We first convert the total amount of lacquer into斗 by summing up all the contributions from斛,斗,升, and太半升.
2. We then calculate the cost per斗 using the formula \( \text{Cost per斗} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Total amount in斗}} \).
3. The result is stored in the variable `a`, which represents the cost per斗 in錢.
