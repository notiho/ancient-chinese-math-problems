今有委菽依垣，下周三丈，高七尺。問︰積及為菽各幾何？
委粟術曰：下周自乘，以高乘之，三十六而一。其依垣者，十八而一。其依垣內角者，九而一。程粟一斛，積二尺七寸。其米一斛，積一尺六寸、五分寸之一。其菽、答、麻、麥一斛，皆二尺四寸、十分寸之三。
荅曰：積 a尺 。為菽 b斛 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the volume of a pile of grain (菽) leaning against a wall and then determining how many "斛" (a unit of volume) of grain it contains.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
周 = Fraction(3 * 10)  # 周 (circumference) in 尺 (1丈 = 10尺)
高 = Fraction(7)       # 高 (height) in 尺
積_per_斛 = Fraction(27, 10)  # Volume per 1斛 of 菽 in 尺³

# Calculation of the volume (積)
積 = (周 ** 2 * 高) / 36  # Formula for volume of a leaning pile of grain

# Calculation of the amount of grain (為菽)
b = 積 / 積_per_斛  # Amount of grain in 斛

# Assigning the results to variables
a = 積  # Volume in 尺³

# Results
a  # Volume of the pile in 尺³
b  # Amount of grain in 斛


"""


### Explanation:
1. **周 (circumference)**: The circumference of the base of the pile is given as 3丈, which is converted to 尺 (1丈 = 10尺).
2. **高 (height)**: The height of the pile is given as 7尺.
3. **積_per_斛**: The volume of 1斛 of 菽 is given as 2尺4寸, which is converted to 尺³. Since 1尺 = 10寸, this becomes \( 2 + \frac{4}{10} = \frac{24}{10} = \frac{27}{10} \) 尺³.
4. **積 (volume)**: The formula for the volume of a leaning pile of grain is \( \frac{\text{周}^2 \times \text{高}}{36} \).
5. **為菽 (amount of grain)**: The amount of grain is the total volume divided by the volume per 1斛.

### Results:
- `a` is the total volume of the pile in 尺³.
- `b` is the amount of grain in 斛.
