今有方物一束外周，一市有三十二枚。問：積幾何？
術曰：重置二位左位減八餘加右位，至盡虛加一，即得。
答曰： a枚 。

"""
To solve this problem, let's translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the total number of items ("積") in a bundle ("方物一束外周") where each unit has 32 items. The solution involves a specific algorithm described in the text.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
unit_items = 32  # Each unit has 32 items

# Algorithm described in the text
# "重置二位左位減八餘加右位，至盡虛加一，即得"
# This means we repeatedly subtract 8 from the leftmost digit and add the remaining digits until no digits are left, then add 1.

# Step-by-step calculation
left_digit = unit_items // 10  # Leftmost digit
right_digit = unit_items % 10  # Remaining digits
result = left_digit - 8 + right_digit  # Subtract 8 from the leftmost digit and add the rightmost digit
a = result + 1  # Add 1 to the result

# Final answer
a = Fraction(a)  # Represent the result as a fraction if needed


"""


The variable `a` contains the solution, which is the total number of items in the bundle.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 81, Actual: -2"""
