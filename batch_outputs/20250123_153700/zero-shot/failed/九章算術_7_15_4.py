今有玉方一寸，重七兩；石方一寸，重六兩。今有石立方三寸，中有玉，并重十一斤。問︰玉、石重各幾何？
術曰：假令皆玉，多十三兩。令之皆石，不足十四兩。不足為玉，多為石。各以一寸之重乘之，得玉石之積重。
荅曰：玉 a寸 ，重 b斤 。石 c寸 ，重 d斤 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the weights of the jade (玉) and stone (石) in a cube with a side length of 3 inches, where the total weight is 11 pounds. The problem provides the weight of a 1-inch cube of jade (7 ounces) and a 1-inch cube of stone (6 ounces). 

We will use the following variables:
- `a`: the volume of jade in cubic inches.
- `b`: the weight of jade in pounds.
- `c`: the volume of stone in cubic inches.
- `d`: the weight of stone in pounds.

### Problem Setup:
1. The total volume of the cube is \( 3^3 = 27 \) cubic inches.
   \[
   a + c = 27
   \]
2. The total weight of the cube is 11 pounds (176 ounces, since 1 pound = 16 ounces).
   \[
   7a + 6c = 176
   \]

We solve these equations to find \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \).

### Python Code:

"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total volume of the cube
total_volume = 27  # cubic inches
# Total weight of the cube
total_weight = 11 * 16  # ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces)

# Solve the system of equations:
# a + c = 27
# 7a + 6c = 176

# Step 1: Express c in terms of a from the first equation
# c = total_volume - a
c = total_volume - a

# Step 2: Substitute c into the second equation
# 7a + 6(total_volume - a) = total_weight
# 7a + 6(27 - a) = 176
# 7a + 162 - 6a = 176
# a = 176 - 162
# a = 14

a = Fraction(14)  # cubic inches of jade
c = total_volume - a  # cubic inches of stone
c = Fraction(c)

# Step 3: Calculate the weights
b = a * 7 / 16  # weight of jade in pounds
d = c * 6 / 16  # weight of stone in pounds

# Results
a = a  # cubic inches of jade
b = b  # weight of jade in pounds
c = c  # cubic inches of stone
d = d  # weight of stone in pounds


"""


### Solution:
- \( a = 14 \) cubic inches of jade.
- \( b = \frac{49}{8} \) pounds of jade.
- \( c = 13 \) cubic inches of stone.
- \( d = \frac{39}{8} \) pounds of stone.
