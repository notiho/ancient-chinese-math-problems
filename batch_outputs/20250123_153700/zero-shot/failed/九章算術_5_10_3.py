To solve the problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the volume of a trapezoidal canal and determining the number of workers required to complete the task.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given dimensions of the canal
upper_width = Fraction(1, 1) + Fraction(8, 10)  # 1丈8尺 = 1 + 8/10 丈
lower_width = Fraction(3, 10) + Fraction(6, 100)  # 3尺6寸 = 3/10 + 6/100 丈
depth = Fraction(1, 1) + Fraction(8, 10)  # 1丈8尺 = 1 + 8/10 丈
length = Fraction(51824, 10)  # 51824尺 = 51824/10 丈

# Calculate the volume of the canal
average_width = (upper_width + lower_width) / 2  # Average width
volume = average_width * depth * length  # Volume in cubic 丈

# Convert volume to cubic 尺 (1 cubic 丈 = 1000 cubic 尺)
volume_in_cubic_chi = volume * 1000

# Given worker efficiency
worker_efficiency = Fraction(300, 1)  # 300 cubic 尺 per worker

# Calculate the number of workers required
workers = volume_in_cubic_chi // worker_efficiency  # Integer division for full workers
remaining_work = volume_in_cubic_chi % worker_efficiency  # Remaining work in cubic 尺

# Assign results to variables
a = workers  # Number of workers
b = remaining_work  # Remaining work in cubic 尺

# Results
a, b

### Explanation:
1. **Units Conversion**: All measurements are converted to 丈 (1丈 = 10尺, 1尺 = 10寸).
2. **Volume Calculation**: The volume of the trapezoidal canal is calculated using the formula for the volume of a prism with a trapezoidal base:  
   \[
   V = \text{average width} \times \text{depth} \times \text{length}
   \]
3. **Worker Calculation**: The total volume in cubic 尺 is divided by the efficiency of one worker (300 cubic 尺 per worker) to determine the number of workers required. The remainder represents the work left over.

### Final Answer:
The number of workers required is stored in variable `a`, and the remaining work in cubic 尺 is stored in variable `b`.
