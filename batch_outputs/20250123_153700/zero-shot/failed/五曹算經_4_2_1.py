今有粟七百斛，欲雇車運之每一斛雇七升。問：車主粟主各㡬何？
術曰：列粟七百斛以雇粟七升乘之得四十九斛為車粟以減本粟七百斛餘為主粟。
答曰：車主 a斛 粟主 b斛 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will calculate the amount of grain (粟) that belongs to the car owner (車主, denoted as `a`) and the grain owner (粟主, denoted as `b`). Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_grain = 700  # Total grain in hu (斛)
grain_per_hu_for_hire = Fraction(7, 10)  # Grain per hu for hire (7升 = 7/10斛)

# Calculations
a = total_grain * grain_per_hu_for_hire  # Grain for the car owner
b = total_grain - a  # Grain for the grain owner

# Results
a, b


"""


Here, `a` represents the amount of grain for the car owner, and `b` represents the amount of grain for the grain owner. The units are in hu (斛).
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 49, Actual: 490
Variable 'b' has wrong value. Expected: 651, Actual: 210"""
