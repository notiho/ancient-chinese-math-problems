今有粟，二千三百七十四斛，斛加三升。問：共粟幾何？
術曰：置粟二千三百七十四斛，以一斛三升乘之，即得。
答曰： a斛 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of grain when each "斛" (unit of grain) is increased by 3 "升" (a smaller unit of grain). The original amount of grain is 2374 "斛". 

Here is the Python code to compute the answer:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
original_grain = 2374  # in 斛
increase_per_hu = Fraction(3, 10)  # 3 升 is equivalent to 3/10 斛

# Calculation
a = original_grain * (1 + increase_per_hu)  # Total grain in 斛

# Result
a  # This is the total amount of grain in 斛


"""


The variable `a` will store the total amount of grain in "斛". Note that 3 "升" is equivalent to 3/10 of a "斛".
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 122261/50, Actual: 15431/5"""
