"""
今有粟四斗一升、太半升，欲為答。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求菽、答、麻、麥，皆九之，十而一。
荅曰：為答 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem states that we have 4斗1升 and 太半升 of 粟 (grain). The goal is to compute the value of "答" (a斗), where the relationship is described as multiplying the 粟 by 9/10.

First, let's understand the units:
- 1斗 = 10升
- 太半升 = 0.5升 (half a 升)

The total 粟 is given as 4斗1升 + 太半升, which we convert into a single unit (升). Then, we multiply this total by 9/10 to compute the value of "答".

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 粟 in terms of 升
粟 = 4 * 10 + 1 + Fraction(1, 2)  # 4斗1升 + 太半升 = 4斗 * 10升/斗 + 1升 + 0.5升

# Compute 答
a = 粟 * Fraction(9, 10) / 10  # Multiply by 9/10 and convert back to 斗

# Result
a  # 答 in terms of 斗


"""


This will compute the value of "答" (a斗).

"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 15/4, Actual: 747/200"""
