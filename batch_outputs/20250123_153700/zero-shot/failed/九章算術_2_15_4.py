今有粟七斗八升，欲為豉。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求豉，六十三之，五十而一。
荅曰：為豉 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many "斗" of "豉" can be made from 7斗8升 of "粟". The rule provided is that for every 63 units of "粟", 50 units of "豉" can be produced.

Here is the Python code to compute the value of "a" (the amount of "豉"):


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
粟_in_斗 = Fraction(7) + Fraction(8, 10)  # 7斗8升, where 1斗 = 10升

# Conversion rule: 63 units of 粟 produce 50 units of 豉
conversion_ratio = Fraction(50, 63)

# Calculate the amount of 豉
a = 粟_in_斗 * conversion_ratio

# Result
a  # The amount of 豉 in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of "豉" in "斗".
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 2457/250, Actual: 130/21"""
