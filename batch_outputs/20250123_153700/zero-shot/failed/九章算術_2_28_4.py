"""
今有菽二斗，欲為豉。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以菽求豉，七之，五而一。
荅曰：為豉 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem states that we have 2 "斗" of 菽 (beans) and want to know how much 豉 (fermented beans) can be made. The rule is: "以菽求豉，七之，五而一," which means for every 7 parts of beans, 5 parts of fermented beans are produced.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
beans = 2  # in 斗

# Rule: for every 7 parts of beans, 5 parts of fermented beans are produced
fermented_beans_ratio = Fraction(5, 7)

# Calculate the amount of fermented beans
a = beans * fermented_beans_ratio  # in 斗

# The result
a  # in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of fermented beans in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 14/5, Actual: 10/7"""
