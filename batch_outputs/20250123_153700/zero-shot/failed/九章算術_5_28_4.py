今有冥谷上廣二丈，袤七丈，下廣八尺，袤四丈，深六丈五尺。問︰積幾何？
荅曰：五萬二千尺。
荅曰：人到二百一尺、五十分尺之十三。用徒二百五十八人、一萬六十三分人之三千七百四十六。
術曰：以一車積尺乘程行步數為實。置今往來步數，加載輸之間一里，以車六人乘之，為法。除之，所得即一人所到尺。以所到約積尺，即用徒人數。
荅曰：人到 a尺 。用徒 b人 。

To solve the problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the volume of a trapezoidal prism and determining the distance covered by a person and the number of workers required.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given dimensions
upper_width = Fraction(2 * 10)  # 2丈 = 20尺
upper_length = Fraction(7 * 10)  # 7丈 = 70尺
lower_width = Fraction(8)  # 8尺
lower_length = Fraction(4 * 10)  # 4丈 = 40尺
depth = Fraction(6 * 10 + 5)  # 6丈5尺 = 65尺

# Calculate the volume of the trapezoidal prism
upper_area = upper_width * upper_length
lower_area = lower_width * lower_length
volume = (upper_area + lower_area) * depth / 2  # Trapezoidal prism formula

# Given additional information
steps_per_trip = Fraction(1000)  # 1里 = 1000步
people_per_cart = Fraction(6)  # 6 people per cart
total_steps = Fraction(2 * 1000)  # round trip = 2里 = 2000步

# Calculate the distance covered by one person
distance_per_person = (volume * total_steps) / (steps_per_trip * people_per_cart)

# Calculate the number of workers required
workers_needed = volume / distance_per_person

# Assign the results to variables
a = distance_per_person  # Distance covered by one person
b = workers_needed  # Number of workers required

# Results
a, b


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Volume Calculation**:
   - The volume of the trapezoidal prism is calculated using the formula for the volume of a trapezoidal prism:  
     \[
     V = \frac{(A_{\text{upper}} + A_{\text{lower}}) \cdot \text{depth}}{2}
     \]
   - Here, \(A_{\text{upper}}\) and \(A_{\text{lower}}\) are the areas of the upper and lower bases of the trapezoid.

2. **Distance Covered by One Person**:
   - The total steps taken by all people are calculated by multiplying the volume by the total steps per trip and dividing by the product of steps per cart and the number of people per cart.

3. **Number of Workers Required**:
   - The number of workers is calculated by dividing the total volume by the distance covered by one person.

### Final Results:
- `a`: Distance covered by one person in 尺.
- `b`: Number of workers required.
