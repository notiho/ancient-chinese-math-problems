今有委菽依垣，下周三丈，高七尺。問︰積及為菽各幾何？
委粟術曰：下周自乘，以高乘之，三十六而一。其依垣者，十八而一。其依垣內角者，九而一。程粟一斛，積二尺七寸。其米一斛，積一尺六寸、五分寸之一。其菽、答、麻、麥一斛，皆二尺四寸、十分寸之三。
荅曰：積 a尺 。為菽 b斛 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the volume (積) and the amount of grain (為菽) based on the given dimensions and conversion factors.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given dimensions
周 = Fraction(3 * 10)  # 周 is 3丈, converted to 尺 (1丈 = 10尺)
高 = Fraction(7)       # 高 is 7尺

# Conversion factors
積_per_斛_菽 = Fraction(24, 10)  # 菽 occupies 2尺4寸, which is 24/10 尺 per 斛

# Calculations
積 = (周 ** 2) * 高 / Fraction(36)  # Volume calculation: 下周自乘，以高乘之，三十六而一
為菽 = 積 / 積_per_斛_菽           # Calculate the amount of 菽

# Assign results to variables
a = 積
b = 為菽

# Results
a, b


"""


### Explanation:
1. **周 and 高**: The 周 (circumference) is given as 3丈, which is converted to 尺 (1丈 = 10尺). The 高 (height) is 7尺.
2. **Conversion factors**: The problem states that 1斛 of 菽 occupies 2尺4寸, which is equivalent to \( \frac{24}{10} \) 尺.
3. **Volume calculation**: The formula for the volume is \( \text{周}^2 \times \text{高} \div 36 \).
4. **Amount of 菽**: The amount of 菽 is calculated by dividing the volume by the volume occupied by 1斛 of 菽.
5. **Results**: The results are stored in variables `a` (volume in 尺) and `b` (amount of 菽 in 斛).

### Output:
The variables `a` and `b` will contain the results for the volume and the amount of 菽, respectively.
