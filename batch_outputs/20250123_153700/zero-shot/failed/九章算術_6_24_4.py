今有程耕，一人一日發七畝，一人一日耕三畝，一人一日耰種五畝。今令一人一日自發、耕、耰種之，問︰治田幾何？
術曰：置發、耕、耰畝數，令互乘人數，并以為法。畝數相乘為實。實如法得一畝。
荅曰： a畝 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much land one person can manage in one day if they perform all three tasks: "發" (7 畝/day), "耕" (3 畝/day), and "耰種" (5 畝/day). The solution involves combining these rates into a single equivalent rate.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Rates for each task
發 = 7  # 畝/day
耕 = 3  # 畝/day
耰種 = 5  # 畝/day

# Calculate the combined rate
a = Fraction(1, (1/發 + 1/耕 + 1/耰種))

# The result
a  # in 畝


"""


The variable `a` represents the amount of land (in 畝) that one person can manage in one day when performing all three tasks.
