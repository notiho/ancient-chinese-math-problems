今有官田九百畝凡一步收粟三升二合。問：計㡬何？
術曰：列田九百畝以二百四十步乘之得二十一萬六千步以三升二合乘之即得。
答曰： a斛 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The total area of the field is 900 畝 (mu).
2. Each 畝 is equivalent to 240 steps (步).
3. Each step yields 3 升 (sheng) and 2 合 (he). Note that 1 升 = 10 合.

We need to calculate the total yield in terms of 斛 (hu). Note that 1 斛 = 10 升.

Here is the Python code to compute the answer:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
field_area_mu = 900  # in 畝
steps_per_mu = 240  # steps per 畝
yield_per_step_sheng = Fraction(3) + Fraction(2, 10)  # 3 升 2 合 = 3 + 2/10 升
sheng_per_hu = 10  # 1 斛 = 10 升

# Total steps in the field
total_steps = field_area_mu * steps_per_mu

# Total yield in 升
total_yield_sheng = total_steps * yield_per_step_sheng

# Convert yield to 斛
a = total_yield_sheng / sheng_per_hu

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'
a


"""


This code calculates the total yield in 斛 and stores the result in the variable `a`.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 6912, Actual: 69120"""
