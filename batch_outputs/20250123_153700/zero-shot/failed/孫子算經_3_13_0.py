今有三人共車，二車空；二人共車，九人步。問：人與車各幾何？
術曰：置二人以三乘之，得六，加步者九人，得車一十五，欲知人者，以二乘車，加九人即得。
答曰： a 車， b人 。

To solve this problem, we need to translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. Let's compute the values of the unknowns `a` (number of cars) and `b` (number of people).

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Let a = number of cars, b = number of people
# Equation 1: 3b = 2a + 9 (three people per car, two cars empty, nine people walking)
# Equation 2: 2b = 9a (two people per car, nine people walking)

# Solve the equations
# From Equation 2: b = (9/2)a
b = Fraction(9, 2) * a

# Substitute b into Equation 1: 3((9/2)a) = 2a + 9
3 * Fraction(9, 2) * a == 2 * a + 9

#
