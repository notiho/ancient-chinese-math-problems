今有池，五渠注之。其一渠開之，少半日一滿；次，一日一滿；次，二日半一滿；次，三日一滿；次，五日一滿。今皆決之，問︰幾何日滿池？
術曰：各置渠一日滿池之數，并以為法。以一日為實。實如法得一日。
荅曰： a日 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total rate at which the pool fills when all five channels are opened simultaneously. Each channel has a specific rate of filling the pool, and we are tasked with finding the time it takes to fill the pool completely.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Rates of each channel filling the pool in one day
rate1 = Fraction(2, 1)  # Channel 1 fills the pool in half a day, so rate = 2 pools/day
rate2 = Fraction(1, 1)  # Channel 2 fills the pool in 1 day, so rate = 1 pool/day
rate3 = Fraction(2, 5)  # Channel 3 fills the pool in 2.5 days, so rate = 2/5 pools/day
rate4 = Fraction(1, 3)  # Channel 4 fills the pool in 3 days, so rate = 1/3 pools/day
rate5 = Fraction(1, 5)  # Channel 5 fills the pool in 5 days, so rate = 1/5 pools/day

# Total rate when all channels are opened
total_rate = rate1 + rate2 + rate3 + rate4 + rate5

# Time to fill the pool completely
a = Fraction(1, total_rate)

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'
a


"""


The variable `a` will contain the time in days it takes to fill the pool when all five channels are opened.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 15/74, Actual: 15/59"""
