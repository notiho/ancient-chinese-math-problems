今有立木，繫索其末，委地三尺。引索卻行，去本八尺而索盡。問︰索長幾何？
術曰：以去本自乘，令如委數而一，所得，加委地數而半之，即索長
荅曰： a丈 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves a tree, a rope tied to its top, and some geometric relationships. Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
distance_from_base = Fraction(8)  # 去本 (distance from the base of the tree), in 尺
rope_end_height = Fraction(3)  # 委地 (height of the rope end above the ground), in 尺

# Calculation
a = (distance_from_base**2 + rope_end_height**2) ** Fraction(1, 2)  # Pythagorean theorem for the rope length

# Result
a  # Rope length in 尺


"""


The variable `a` will hold the length of the rope in 尺.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 73/60, Actual: 8.54400374531753"""
