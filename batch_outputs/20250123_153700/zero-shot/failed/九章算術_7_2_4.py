今有共買璡，人出半，盈四；人出少半，不足三。問︰人數、璡價各幾何？
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰： a人 ，璡價 b 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the number of people (`a`) and the price of the item (`b`) based on the given conditions.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. If each person contributes half the price, there is an excess of 4 units of money.
2. If each person contributes less than half the price, there is a shortage of 3 units of money.

We need to calculate the number of people (`a`) and the price of the item (`b`).

### Python Code:

"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Let the number of people be 'a' and the price of the item be 'b'.
# According to the problem:
# (1) a * (1/2) = b + 4
# (2) a * (1/2 - 1/2) = b - 3

#
