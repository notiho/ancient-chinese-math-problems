今有粟，二千三百七十四斛，斛加三升。問：共粟幾何？
術曰：置粟二千三百七十四斛，以一斛三升乘之，即得。
答曰： a斛 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of grain when each "斛" (unit of grain) is increased by 3 "升" (a smaller unit of grain). The total number of "斛" is 2374. 

We will use the class `Fraction` to handle the calculation since the result might not be an integer.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_hu = 2374  # Total number of "斛"
additional_sheng_per_hu = Fraction(3, 10)  # 3升 = 3/10斛 (1斛 = 10升)

# Calculation
a = total_hu * (1 + additional_sheng_per_hu)  # Total grain in "斛"

# The result is stored in variable 'a'


"""


The variable `a` will contain the total amount of grain in "斛".
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 122261/50, Actual: 15431/5"""
