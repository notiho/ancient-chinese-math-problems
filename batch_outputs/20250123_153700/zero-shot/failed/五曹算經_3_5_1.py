今有豆八百四十九斛，凡豆九斗易麻七斗。問：得麻㡬何？
術曰：列豆八百四十九斛，以七十乘之得五萬九千四百三十斛，以九十除之即得。
答曰： a斛 奇 b升 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much "麻" (hemp) can be obtained by exchanging 849斛 (hu) of "豆" (beans), given the exchange rate of 9斗 (dou) of beans for 7斗 of hemp. The answer is expressed in terms of 斛 (hu) and 升 (sheng), where 1斛 = 10斗 and 1斗 = 10升.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
beans = 849  # in 斛
exchange_rate_beans = 9  # in 斗
exchange_rate_hemp = 7  # in 斗

# Convert beans to 斗 (1 斛 = 10 斗)
beans_in_dou = beans * 10

# Calculate the equivalent hemp in 斗
hemp_in_dou = Fraction(beans_in_dou * exchange_rate_hemp, exchange_rate_beans)

# Convert the result to 斛 and 升
a = hemp_in_dou // 10  # Integer part in 斛
b = (hemp_in_dou % 10) * 10  # Remaining part in 升

# Results
a = int(a)  # Convert to integer for 斛
b = int(b)  # Convert to integer for 升


"""


After running this code, the variables `a` and `b` will contain the solution:

- `a` is the number of 斛 (hu) of hemp obtained.
- `b` is the number of 升 (sheng) of hemp obtained.

"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 660333/1000, Actual: 660
Variable 'b' has wrong value. Expected: 3, Actual: 33"""
