We need to find the number of people (`a`) and the price of a chicken (`b`).\n\n### Solution:\nUsing the \"\u76c8\u4e0d\u8db3\u8853\" (Surplus and Deficit Method), the solution can be derived as follows:\n1. Let `a` be the number of people and `b` be the price of a chicken.\n2. The total money collected when each person contributes 9 is `9a`, and the surplus is 11. Thus, the total price of the chickens is `9a - 11`.\n3. The total money collected when each person contributes 6 is `6a`, and the deficit is 16.

We use the `Fraction` class to ensure that the calculations are accurate and handle non-integer results.\n2. The number of people (`a`) is calculated by solving the equation `9a - 11 = 6a + 16`.\n3.
