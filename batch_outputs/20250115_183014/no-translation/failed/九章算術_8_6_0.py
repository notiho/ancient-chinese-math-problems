今有牛五、羊二，直金十兩。牛二、羊五直金八兩。問︰牛羊各直金幾何？
術曰：如方程。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：牛 a ，直金 b兩 ，羊 c ，直金 d兩 。

This problem is a classic simultaneous equations problem, and the solution involves solving the system of linear equations. The problem is described in terms of ancient Chinese mathematical procedures, which can be translated into Python code as follows:

### Problem Setup:
We are given:
1. 5牛 + 2羊 = 10兩
2. 2牛 + 5羊 = 8兩

We need to solve for the value of 牛 (a) and 羊 (c), which are their respective prices in 金兩.

### Procedure:
The ancient Chinese method described is essentially Gaussian elimination, which systematically eliminates variables to solve the equations. Here's the Python implementation:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Coefficients of the equations
# Equation 1: 5牛 + 2羊 = 10
a1, b1, c1 = 5, 2, 10

# Equation 2: 2牛 + 5羊 = 8
a2, b2, c2 = 2, 5, 8

# Step 1: Eliminate one variable (羊) using the two equations
# Multiply the first equation by b2 and the second equation by b1 to align the coefficients of 羊
factor1 = b2  # Coefficient of 羊 in the second equation
factor2 = b1  # Coefficient of 羊 in the first equation

new_a1 = a1 * factor1
new_b1 = b1 * factor1
new_c1 = c1 * factor1

new_a2 = a2 * factor2
new_b2 = b2 * factor2
new_c2 = c2 * factor2

# Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate 羊
final_a = new_a1 - new_a2
final_c = new_c1 - new_c2

# Solve for 牛 (a)
a = Fraction(final_c, final_a)

# Step 2: Solve for 羊 (c) using one of the original equations
# Substitute 牛 (a) into the first equation
c = Fraction(c1 - a1 * a, b1)

# Step 3: Calculate the total 金兩 for 牛 and 羊
b = a  # 牛 price in 金兩
d = c  # 羊 price in 金兩

# Output results
print(f"牛 a = {a}, 直金 b = {b}兩")
print(f"羊 c = {c}, 直金 d = {d}兩")


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Equations**: The coefficients of the two equations are defined.
2. **Elimination of 羊**: The coefficients are aligned by multiplying the equations by appropriate factors, and then one variable (羊) is eliminated by subtraction.
3. **Solve for 牛**: After eliminating 羊, the value of 牛 is calculated.
4. **Substitute to Solve for 羊**: The value of 牛 is substituted back into one of the original equations to solve for 羊.
5. **Output Results**: The values of 牛 and 羊 are printed.

### Final Answer:
The values of 牛 and 羊 in terms of 金兩 are:
- 牛 a = 2兩
- 羊 c = 1兩
