今有漆三得油四，油四和漆五。今有漆三斗，欲令分以易油，還自和餘漆。問︰出漆、得油、和漆各幾何？
術曰：假令出漆九升，不足六升。令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰：出漆 a斗 ，得油 b斗 ，和漆 c斗 ， d升 。

To solve this problem, we will follow the ancient Chinese "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method) and translate it into Python code step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **漆三得油四**: 3 units of 漆 can be exchanged for 4 units of 油.
2. **油四和漆五**: 4 units of 油 can be mixed with 5 units of 漆.
3. **漆三斗**: We start with 3 斗 of 漆.
4. **Goal**: Determine how much 漆 is used for exchange, how much 油 is obtained, and how much 漆 remains for mixing.

### Procedure:
1. Use the "盈不足術" to calculate the exchange and mixing process.
2. Follow the rules for proportional exchange and mixing.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 漆三得油四 (漆 to 油 exchange rate)
漆_to_油_rate = Fraction(4, 3)

# 油四和漆五 (油 to 漆 mixing rate)
油_to_漆_rate = Fraction(5, 4)

# Initial 漆 quantity: 3斗
initial_漆 = 3

# Step 1: Calculate how much 漆 is used for exchange
# Assume we exchange all 3斗 of 漆 for 油
得油 = initial_漆 * 漆_to_油_rate

# Step 2: Calculate how much 漆 is needed to mix with the obtained 油
和漆 = 得油 * 油_to_漆_rate

# Step 3: Calculate remaining 漆 after mixing
remaining_漆 = initial_漆 - 和漆

# Convert results to 斗 and 升 (1斗 = 10升)
a = initial_漆  # 出漆 (漆 used for exchange)
b = 得油  # 得油 (油 obtained)
c = 和漆.numerator // 和漆.denominator  # 和漆 in 斗
d = (和漆 - c) * 10  # 和漆 remaining in 升

# Output results
a斗 = a
b斗 = b
c斗 = c
d升 = d

# Results
a斗, b斗, c斗, d升


"""


### Explanation of Variables:
- `a斗`: 漆 used for exchange (in 斗).
- `b斗`: 油 obtained from the exchange (in 斗).
- `c斗`: 漆 used for mixing (in 斗).
- `d升`: Remaining 漆 after mixing (in 升).

This code follows the ancient procedure and calculates the required values step by step.
