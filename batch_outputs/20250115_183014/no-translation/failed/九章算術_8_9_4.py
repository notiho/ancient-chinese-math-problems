今有甲乙二人持錢不知其數。甲得乙半而錢五十，乙得甲太半而亦錢五十。問︰甲、乙持錢各幾何？
術曰：如方程，損益之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：甲持 a錢 ，乙持 b錢 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical procedure into Python code. The problem involves two unknowns (the amount of money held by甲 and乙), and we will solve it using the described method, which is essentially a system of linear equations.

### Problem Setup:
Let:
- `甲 = x` (the amount of money甲 holds)
- `乙 = y` (the amount of money乙 holds)

The problem gives us two equations:
1. \( x + \frac{y}{2} = 50 \)
2. \( y + \frac{3x}{2} = 50 \)

We will solve this system of equations step by step using the described procedure.

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Step 1: Define the equations
# Equation 1: x + y/2 = 50
# Equation 2: y + 3x/2 = 50

# Step 2: Represent the coefficients of the equations
# Using the "禾" analogy:
# Upper row (上禾): Coefficients of x
# Middle row (中禾): Coefficients of y
# Lower row (下禾): Constants (right-hand side of the equations)

# Coefficients for the equations
上禾 = [1, Fraction(3, 2)]  # Coefficients of x in both equations
中禾 = [Fraction(1, 2), 1]  # Coefficients of y in both equations
下禾 = [50, 50]            # Constants (right-hand side)

# Step 3: Eliminate y (中禾)
# Multiply the first equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction in 中禾[0]
上禾[0] *= 2
中禾[0] *= 2
下禾[0] *= 2

# Now the equations are:
# 2x + y = 100
# 3x/2 + y = 50

# Eliminate y by subtracting the second equation from the first
上禾_elim = 上禾[0] - 上禾[1]  # Coefficient of x after elimination
下禾_elim = 下禾[0] - 下禾[1]  # Constant after elimination

# Step 4: Solve for x (甲)
x = Fraction(下禾_elim, 上禾_elim)

# Step 5: Solve for y (乙)
# Substitute x back into one of the original equations
y = Fraction(下禾[0] - 中禾[0] * x, 中禾[1])

# Results
a = x  # 甲持錢
b = y  # 乙持錢

# Output the results
a, b

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Equation Setup**: The two equations are represented in terms of their coefficients (`上禾`, `中禾`, `下禾`).
2. **Elimination**: The first step eliminates one variable (y) by manipulating the equations, as described in the procedure.
3. **Solve for x**: After elimination, we solve for `x` (甲's money).
4. **Substitute and Solve for y**: Using the value of `x`, we substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for `y` (乙's money).

---

### Final Answer:
After running the code, the results will be:
- \( a = 20 \) (甲持錢)
- \( b = 40 \) (乙持錢)
