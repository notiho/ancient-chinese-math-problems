今有漆三得油四，油四和漆五。今有漆三斗，欲令分以易油，還自和餘漆。問︰出漆、得油、和漆各幾何？
術曰：假令出漆九升，不足六升。令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰：出漆 a斗 ，得油 b斗 ，和漆 c斗 ， d升 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical procedure into Python code step by step.

### Definitions and Initial Setup
- 漆三得油四: 3 units of 漆 can be exchanged for 4 units of 油.
- 油四和漆五: 4 units of 油 can be mixed with 5 units of 漆.
- 漆三斗: We start with 3 斗 of 漆.

We need to calculate:
1. 出漆 (漆 used for exchange)
2. 得油 (油 obtained from exchange)
3. 和漆 (漆 left after mixing with oil)

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 漆三得油四
漆_to_油_rate = Fraction(4, 3)

# 油四和漆五
油_to_漆_rate = Fraction(5, 4)

# 漆三斗
漆_total = 3  # in 斗

# 假令出漆九升，不足六升 (assume 9 升, not enough by 6 升)
假出漆 = Fraction(9, 10)  # 9 升 = 9/10 斗
不足 = Fraction(6, 10)  # 6 升 = 6/10 斗

# 令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升 (assume 1 斗 2 升, remainder 2 升)
出漆 = Fraction(1, 1) + Fraction(2, 10)  # 1 斗 2 升 = 1 + 2/10 斗
餘漆 = 漆_total - 出漆  # Remaining 漆 after exchange

# Calculate 得油 (油 obtained from exchange)
得油 = 出漆 * 漆_to_油_rate

# Calculate 和漆 (漆 left after mixing with 得油)
和漆 = 餘漆 - (得油 * 油_to_漆_rate)

# Convert 和漆 into 斗 and 升
和漆_斗 = int(和漆)  # Whole 斗
和漆_升 = (和漆 - 和漆_斗) * 10  # Convert fractional part to 升

# Final results
a = 出漆  # 出漆 in 斗
b = 得油  # 得油 in 斗
c = 和漆_斗  # 和漆 in 斗
d = 和漆_升  # 和漆 in 升

# Output results
a, b, c, d

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Exchange Rate Calculations**:
   - 漆_to_油_rate is the rate at which 漆 is exchanged for 油 (4 units of 油 for 3 units of 漆).
   - 油_to_漆_rate is the rate at which 油 is mixed with 漆 (5 units of 漆 for 4 units of 油).

2. **假令出漆**:
   - We assume an initial amount of 漆 to be exchanged (9 升, or 9/10 斗) and adjust based on the problem's conditions.

3. **Calculate 出漆 and 餘漆**:
   - 出漆 is the amount of 漆 used for exchange (1 斗 2 升, or 1 + 2/10 斗).
   - 餘漆 is the remaining 漆 after the exchange.

4. **Calculate 得油**:
   - 得油 is the amount of 油 obtained from the exchange, calculated using the 漆_to_油_rate.

5. **Calculate 和漆**:
   - 和漆 is the remaining 漆 after mixing 得油 with 漆, calculated using the 油_to_漆_rate.

6. **Convert 和漆 to 斗 and 升**:
   - 和漆 is split into whole 斗 and fractional 升 for the final answer.

### Final Answer
- 出漆: `a` 斗
- 得油: `b` 斗
- 和漆: `c` 斗, `d` 升
