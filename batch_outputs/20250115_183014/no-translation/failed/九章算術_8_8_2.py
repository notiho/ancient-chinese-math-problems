今有五雀、六燕，集稱之衡，雀俱重，燕俱輕。一雀一燕交而處，衡適平。并燕、雀重一斤。問︰燕、雀一枚各重幾何？
術曰：如方程，交易質之，各重八兩。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：雀重 a兩 ，燕重 b兩 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical procedure into Python code step by step. The problem involves solving a system of equations using a method similar to Gaussian elimination. Here's the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given:
# 5 sparrows (雀), 6 swallows (燕), total weight = 1斤 = 16兩
total_weight = 16  # in 兩
sparrows = 5
swallows = 6

# Equation 1: 5x + 6y = 16 (total weight)
# Equation 2: x + y = 8 (from "一雀一燕交而處，衡適平")

# Step 1: Solve for y in terms of x using Equation 2
# x + y = 8 => y = 8 - x
# Substitute y into Equation 1

# Step 2: Substitute y = 8 - x into 5x + 6y = 16
# 5x + 6(8 - x) = 16
# 5x + 48 - 6x = 16
# -x + 48 = 16
# x = 48 - 16
x = Fraction(48 - 16)

# Step 3: Solve for y using y = 8 - x
y = Fraction(8 - x)

# Results:
a = x  # weight of one sparrow in 兩
b = y  # weight of one swallow in 兩

# Output the results
a, b

### Explanation:
1. **Equation Setup**: The problem gives two equations:
   - The total weight of 5 sparrows and 6 swallows is 16兩.
   - The weight of one sparrow and one swallow together is 8兩.

2. **Substitution**: We solve for one variable (y) in terms of the other (x) using the second equation and substitute it into the first equation.

3. **Simplification**: Simplify the resulting equation to find the value of x (weight of one sparrow).

4. **Back-substitution**: Use the value of x to find y (weight of one swallow).

### Final Answer:
- `a` (weight of one sparrow) = 8兩
- `b` (weight of one swallow) = 8兩
