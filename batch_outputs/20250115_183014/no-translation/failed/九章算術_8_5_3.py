今有上禾三秉，益實六斗，當下禾十秉。下禾五秉，益實一斗，當上禾二秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾三秉正，下禾一十秉負，益實六斗負。次置上禾二秉負，下禾五秉正，益實一斗負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：上禾 a秉 實 b斗 ，下禾 c秉 實 d斗 。

To solve this problem, we will follow the ancient Chinese method of solving simultaneous linear equations, as described in the procedure. Let's translate the procedure into Python code step by step.

from fractions import Fraction

# Step 1: Define the equations based on the problem statement
# Equation 1: 3上禾 - 10下禾 = -6斗
# Equation 2: -2上禾 + 5下禾 = -1斗

# Coefficients for the equations
# [上禾, 下禾, 常數]
equation1 = [3, -10, -6]
equation2 = [-2, 5, -1]

# Step 2: Use the elimination method to solve the equations
# Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to align the 上禾 coefficients
eq1_scaled = [2 * x for x in equation1]  # [6, -20, -12]
eq2_scaled = [3 * x for x in equation2]  # [-6, 15, -3]

]  # [0, -5, -15]

# Solve for 下禾
下禾 = Fraction(-combined[2], combined[1])  # 下禾 = -(-15) / -5 = 3斗

# Substitute 下禾 back into one of the original equations to solve for 上禾
# Using equation 1: 3上禾 - 10下禾 = -6
上禾 = Fraction(equation1[2] - equation1[1] * 下禾, equation1[0])  # 上禾 = (-6 - (-10 * 3)) / 3 = 8斗

# Step 3: Output the results

c = 1  # 下禾秉數
d = 下禾  # 下禾實

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Define the equations**: The problem gives two equations relating the quantities of 上禾 and 下禾. These are represented as lists of coefficients.
2. **Elimination method**: The coefficients of 上禾 are aligned by scaling the equations, and then 上禾 is eliminated by adding the scaled equations.
3. **Solve for 下禾**: After eliminating 上禾, the value of 下禾 is calculated.
4. **Substitute back**: The value of 下禾 is substituted into one of the original equations to find 上禾.
5. **Output**: The results are presented as the quantities of 上禾 and 下禾 per 秉.

### Final Answer:
```
上禾 1秉 實 8斗 ，下禾 1秉 實 3斗 。
```
