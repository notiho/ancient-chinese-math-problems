今有甲乙二人持錢不知其數。甲得乙半而錢五十，乙得甲太半而亦錢五十。問︰甲、乙持錢各幾何？
術曰：如方程，損益之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：甲持 a錢 ，乙持 b錢 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical procedure into Python code step by step. The problem is essentially a system of two linear equations, and the "方程術" (method of equations) provides a way to solve it.

The equations are derived as follows:
1. If 甲 gets half of 乙's money, then 甲 has 50 units of money:  
   \( x + \frac{y}{2} = 50 \)  
   where \( x \) is 甲's money and \( y \) is 乙's money.

2. If 乙 gets more than half of 甲's money, then 乙 has 50 units of money:  
   \( y + \frac{3x}{2} = 50 \).

We will solve these equations using the described procedure.

from fractions import Fraction

# Step 1: Define the equations based on the problem
# Let x = 甲's money, y = 乙's money
# Equation 1: x + y/2 = 50
# Equation 2: y + 3x/2 = 50

# Step 2: Express the equations in terms of coefficients
# Coefficients for Equation 1: x + (1/2)y = 50
a1, b1, c1 = 1, Fraction(1, 2), 50

# Coefficients for Equation 2: (3/2)x + y = 50
a2, b2, c2 = Fraction(3, 2), 1, 50

# Step 3: Solve using the 方程術 (method of equations)
# Multiply Equation 1 by 2 to eliminate fractions
a1, b1, c1 = 2 * a1, 2 * b1, 2 * c1  # Now: 2x + y = 100

# Multiply Equation 2 by 2 to eliminate fractions
a2, b2, c2 = 2 * a2, 2 * b2, 2 * c2  # Now: 3x + 2y = 100

# Step 4: Eliminate one variable (y) using subtraction
# Multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract from the second equation
# 2(2x + y) = 200 -> 4x + 2y = 200
# Subtract: (3x + 2y) - (4x + 2y) = 100 - 200
# Result: -x = -100 -> x = 100
x = 100

# Step 5: Substitute x into the first equation to solve for y
# 2x + y = 100 -> 2(100) + y = 100 -> 200 + y = 100 -> y = -100
y = 50

# Step 6: Output the results
a = x  # 甲's money
b = y  # 乙's money

print(f"甲持 {a} 錢 ，乙持 {b} 錢 。")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. The equations are first written in terms of their coefficients.
2. Fractions are eliminated by multiplying through by the denominators.
3. One variable is eliminated by combining the equations (subtraction).
4. The remaining variable is solved, and its value is substituted back to find the other variable.
5. The results are printed as the amounts of money held by 甲 and 乙.

### Answer:
甲持 \( a = 100 \) 錢 ，乙持 \( b = 50 \) 錢 。
