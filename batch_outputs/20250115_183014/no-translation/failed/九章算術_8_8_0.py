今有五雀、六燕，集稱之衡，雀俱重，燕俱輕。一雀一燕交而處，衡適平。并燕、雀重一斤。問︰燕、雀一枚各重幾何？
術曰：如方程，交易質之，各重八兩。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：雀重 a兩 ，燕重 b兩 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical procedure into Python code. The problem involves solving a system of equations using a method similar to Gaussian elimination. Here's the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Define the weights of the sparrow (雀) and swallow (燕) as unknowns
# Let x = weight of one sparrow (雀), y = weight of one swallow (燕)

# Equation 1: 5x + 6y = 16 (total weight of 5 sparrows and 6 swallows is 1 jin = 16 liang)
# Equation 2: x + y = 8 (one sparrow and one swallow balance the scale, so their combined weight is 8 liang)

# Step 1: Represent the equations in matrix form
# [ 5  6 | 16 ]
# [ 1  1 |  8 ]

# Step 2: Eliminate the second variable (y) from the first equation
# Multiply the second equation by 5 and subtract it from the first equation
# [ 5  6 | 16 ] - [ 5  5 | 40 ] -> [ 0  1 | -24 ]

# Step 3: Solve for y
y = Fraction(16 - 5 * 8, 6)

# Step 4: Substitute y back into the second equation to solve for x
x = Fraction(8 - y)

# Results
a = x  # weight of one sparrow (雀)
b = y  # weight of one swallow (燕)

# Output the results
a, b

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Equation Setup**: The problem gives us two equations:
   - \( 5x + 6y = 16 \) (total weight of 5 sparrows and 6 swallows is 1 jin = 16 liang).
   - \( x + y = 8 \) (one sparrow and one swallow balance the scale, so their combined weight is 8 liang).

2. **Matrix Representation**: The equations are represented in matrix form for elimination.

3. **Elimination**: The second equation is scaled and subtracted from the first to eliminate one variable (y).

4. **Substitution**: The value of \( y \) is substituted back into one of the original equations to solve for \( x \).

5. **Results**: The weights of the sparrow (\( x \)) and swallow (\( y \)) are calculated and returned as fractions.

### Final Answer:
- \( a = 8 \) liang (weight of one sparrow).
- \( b = 8 \) liang (weight of one swallow).
