In 7 days, it makes 5 round trips.\nQuestion: how far does the empty cart travel per day?\n\nThe procedure says: Place the distance to the granary in li and multiply it by the number of round trips.\nDivide this by the distance a loaded cart travels per day. The result is the number of days spent traveling loaded.\nSubtract this from the total number of days to find the number of days spent traveling empty. Use this as the divisor.\nMultiply the distance to the granary by the number of round trips to get the dividend.\nDivide the dividend by the divisor to find the distance the empty cart travels per day.\n\nAnswer: the empty cart travels *a* li per day.\n\"\"\"\n\n# \u9ea5\u8f38\u592a\u5009\u53bb\u4e09\u5341\u4e03\u91cc\u5341\u516d\u5206\u91cc\u4e4b\u5341\u4e00\n\u53bb\u592a\u5009\u91cc\u6578 = 37 + Fraction(11, 16)\n\n# \u91cd\u8eca\u65e5\u884c\u56db\u5341\u4e94\u91cc\n\u91cd\u8eca\u65e5\u884c\u91cc\u6578 = 45\n\n# \u4e03\u65e5\u4e94\u8fd4\n\u51e1\u65e5\u6578 = 7\n\u8fd4\u6578 = 5\n\n# \u7f6e\u9ea5\u53bb\u592a\u5009\u91cc\u6578\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fd4\u6578\u4e57\u4e4b\n\u91cd\u884c\u7e3d\u91cc\u6578 = \u53bb\u592a\u5009\u91cc\u6578 * \u8fd4\u6578\n\n# \u4ee5\u91cd\u8eca\u65e5\u884c\u91cc\u6578\u800c\u4e00\uff0c\u6240\u5f97\u70ba\u91cd\u884c\u65e5\u6578\n\u91cd\u884c\u65e5\u6578 = Fraction(\u91cd\u884c\u7e3d\u91cc\u6578, \u91cd\u8eca\u65e5\u884c\u91cc\u6578)\n\n# \u4ee5\u6e1b\u51e1\u65e5\u6578\uff0c\u9918\u70ba\u7a7a\u884c\u65e5\u6578\n\u7a7a\u884c\u65e5\u6578 = \u51e1\u65e5\u6578 - \u91cd\u884c\u65e5\u6578\n\n# \u4ee5\u8fd4\u6578\u4e57\u9ea5\u53bb\u592a\u5009\u91cc\u6578\uff0c\u70ba\u5be6\n\u7a7a\u884c\u7e3d\u91cc\u6578 = \u53bb\u592a\u5009\u91cc\u6578 * \u8fd4\u6578\n\n# \u5be6\u5982\u6cd5\u800c\u4e00\na = Fraction(\u7a7a\u884c\u7e3d\u91cc\u6578, \u7a7a\u884c\u65e5\u6578)", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1843, "completion_tokens": 2093, "total_tokens": 3936, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ec7eab8ec3"}}, "error": null}
