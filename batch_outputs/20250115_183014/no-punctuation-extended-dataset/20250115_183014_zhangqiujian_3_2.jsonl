It is desired to place deer horns (spikes) every 3 chi, in 5 layers.\nQuestion: how many deer horns are used in total?\n\nThe procedure says:\n- For a square city: Place the circumference of the city in li, convert it to chi, and divide by 3. Multiply the result by 5.\n- Then, place 5, multiply it by 3, and also square it. Multiply 3 by itself, and divide the result by 4. Add this to the previous result to obtain the total number.\n- For a circular city: Place the circumference of the city in li, convert it to chi, and divide by 3. Multiply the result by 5. Then, add 1, 2, 3, and 4, obtaining 10.
