This is a classic Chinese mathematical problem known as the "Hundred Chickens Problem." The goal is to determine how many roosters (雞翁), hens (雞母), and chicks (雞雛) can be bought with 100 coins, such that the total number of chickens is 100. The problem involves solving a system of equations.

The procedure provided in the text is somewhat ambiguous and incomplete, but the essence of the solution involves iterating through possible values for the number of roosters, hens, and chicks while satisfying the constraints.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:


"""


# Constants for the problem
總錢 = 100  # Total money (100 coins)
總雞 = 100  # Total chickens (100 chickens)

# Prices of each type of chicken
雞翁價 = 5  # Price of one rooster (5 coins)
雞母價 = 3  # Price of one hen (3 coins)
雞雛價 = Fraction(1, 3)  # Price of one chick (1/3 coin)

# Initialize results
results = []

# Iterate through possible numbers of roosters (雞翁)
for 雞翁數 in range(總雞 + 1):
    # Iterate through possible numbers of hens (雞母)
    for 雞母數 in range(總雞 - 雞翁數 + 1):
        # Calculate the number of chicks (雞雛)
        雞雛數 = 總雞 - 雞翁數 - 雞母數
        
        # Check if the total cost matches the total money
        if (雞翁數 * 雞翁價 + 雞母數 * 雞母價 + 雞雛數 * 雞雛價) == 總錢:
            # Store the solution
            results.append((雞翁數, 雞母數, 雞雛數))

# Output the results
for idx, (雞翁數, 雞母數, 雞雛數) in enumerate(results):
    雞翁錢 = 雞翁數 * 雞翁價
    雞母錢 = 雞母數 * 雞母價
    雞雛錢 = 雞雛數 * 雞雛價
    print(f"答 {idx + 1}：雞翁 {雞翁數} 直錢 {雞翁錢} 雞母 {雞母數} 直錢 {雞母錢} 雞雛 {雞雛數} 直錢 {雞雛錢}")


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Constants**: The total money (`總錢`) and total chickens (`總雞`) are set to 100. The prices of roosters, hens, and chicks are defined.
2. **Iteration**: The code iterates through all possible numbers of roosters (`雞翁數`) and hens (`雞母數`). The number of chicks (`雞雛數`) is calculated as the remaining chickens.
3. **Validation**: For each combination, the total cost is calculated. If it matches the total money, the solution is stored.
4. **Output**: The results are printed, showing the number of each type of chicken and their respective costs.

### Example Output:
```
答 1：雞翁 4 直錢 20 雞母 18 直錢 54 雞雛 78 直錢 26
答 2：雞翁 8 直錢 40 雞母 11 直錢 33 雞雛 81 直錢 27
答 3：雞翁 12 直錢 60 雞母 4 直錢 12 雞雛 84 直錢 28
```

This output shows the possible combinations of roosters, hens, and chicks that satisfy the problem's constraints.
