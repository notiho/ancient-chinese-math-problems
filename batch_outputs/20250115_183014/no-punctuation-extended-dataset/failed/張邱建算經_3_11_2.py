This problem is a classic simultaneous equations problem, where we solve for the values of the upper, middle, and lower grades of brocade (上錦, 中錦, 下錦) in terms of their equivalence to plain silk (直絹). The procedure references the "方程術" (method of solving simultaneous equations), which involves systematically solving for each variable.

Here is the Python implementation of the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given equations:
# 3上錦 + 2中錦 + 1下錦 = 45直絹
# 2上錦 + 3中錦 + 1下錦 = 43直絹
# 1上錦 + 2中錦 + 3下錦 = 35直絹

# Coefficients of the equations
A = [
    [3, 2, 1],  # Coefficients for 上錦, 中錦, 下錦 in the first equation
    [2, 3, 1],  # Coefficients for 上錦, 中錦, 下錦 in the second equation
    [1, 2, 3]   # Coefficients for 上錦, 中錦, 下錦 in the third equation
]

# Right-hand side values (直絹 amounts)
B = [45, 43, 35]

# Solve using the method of elimination (方程術)

# Step 1: Eliminate the first variable (上錦) from the second and third equations
factor1 = Fraction(A[1][0], A[0][0])
factor2 = Fraction(A[2][0], A[0][0])

for i in range(3):
    A[1][i] -= factor1 * A[0][i]
    A[2][i] -= factor2 * A[0][i]

B[1] -= factor1 * B[0]
B[2] -= factor2 * B[0]

# Step 2: Eliminate the second variable (中錦) from the third equation
factor3 = Fraction(A[2][1], A[1][1])

for i in range(3):
    A[2][i] -= factor3 * A[1][i]

B[2] -= factor3 * B[1]

# Step 3: Solve for 下錦
下錦 = Fraction(B[2], A[2][2])

# Step 4: Solve for 中錦
中錦 = Fraction(B[1] - A[1][2] * 下錦, A[1][1])

# Step 5: Solve for 上錦
上錦 = Fraction(B[0] - A[0][1] * 中錦 - A[0][2] * 下錦, A[0][0])

# Results
a = 上錦
b = Fraction(1)  # Each unit of 上錦 is equivalent to 1直絹
c = 中錦
d = Fraction(1)  # Each unit of 中錦 is equivalent to 1直絹
e = 下錦
f = Fraction(1)  # Each unit of 下錦 is equivalent to 1直絹

# Output results
a, b, c, d, e, f

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Equations**: The coefficients of the equations and the right-hand side values are input as matrices `A` and `B`.
2. **Elimination**: The method of elimination is used to systematically reduce the equations to solve for one variable at a time.
3. **Back Substitution**: After reducing the equations, the variables are solved in reverse order (starting from 下錦, then 中錦, and finally 上錦).
4. **Output**: The results are stored in variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f`, representing the equivalence of each type of brocade to plain silk.

### Final Answer:
- 上錦 = `a` 疋, equivalent to `b` 疋 of 直絹
- 中錦 = `c` 疋, equivalent to `d` 疋 of 直絹
- 下錦 = `e` 疋, equivalent to `f` 疋 of 直絹
