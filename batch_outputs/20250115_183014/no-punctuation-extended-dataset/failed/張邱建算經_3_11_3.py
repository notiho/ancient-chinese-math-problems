This problem involves solving a system of linear equations, which is described as "方程術" (the method of equations). The problem is essentially asking for the values of the variables corresponding to the prices of upper-grade silk, middle-grade silk, and lower-grade silk in terms of plain silk.

The equations are derived from the problem statement:

1. \( 3x + 2y + 1z = 45 \)
2. \( 2x + 3y + 1z = 43 \)
3. \( 1x + 2y + 3z = 35 \)

Where:
- \( x \) is the value of upper-grade silk in terms of plain silk.
- \( y \) is the value of middle-grade silk in terms of plain silk.
- \( z \) is the value of lower-grade silk in terms of plain silk.

The solution involves solving this system of equations step by step using the method described in the "方程術".

# Coefficients of the equations
# 3x + 2y + 1z = 45
# 2x + 3y + 1z = 43
# 1x + 2y + 3z = 35

# Step 1: Define the coefficients and constants
a1, b1, c1, d1 = 3, 2, 1, 45
a2, b2, c2, d2 = 2, 3, 1, 43
a3, b3, c3, d3 = 1, 2, 3, 35

# Step 2: Eliminate z from the first two equations
# Multiply the first equation by c2 and the second equation by c1, then subtract
factor1 = c2
factor2 = c1

A1 = a1 * factor1 - a2 * factor2
B1 = b1 * factor1 - b2 * factor2
D1 = d1 * factor1 - d2 * factor2

# Step 3: Eliminate z from the second and third equations
# Multiply the second equation by c3 and the third equation by c2, then subtract
factor3 = c3
factor4 = c2

A2 = a2 * factor3 - a3 * factor4
B2 = b2 * factor3 - b3 * factor4
D2 = d2 * factor3 - d3 * factor4

# Step 4: Solve for y using the two new equations
# A1 * x + B1 * y = D1
# A2 * x + B2 * y = D2
# Eliminate x
factor5 = A2
factor6 = A1

B3 = B1 * factor5 - B2 * factor6
D3 = D1 * factor5 - D2 * factor6

# Solve for y
y = Fraction(D3, B3)

# Step 5: Solve for x using one of the reduced equations
x = Fraction(D1 - B1 * y, A1)

# Step 6: Solve for z using one of the original equations
z = Fraction(d1 - a1 * x - b1 * y, c1)

# Results
a = x
b = d1
c = y
d = d2
e = z
f = d3

# Output the results
a, b, c, d, e, f

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Define the coefficients**: The coefficients of the equations are extracted from the problem statement.
2. **Eliminate one variable**: The variable \( z \) is eliminated from the first two equations and the second and third equations by multiplying and subtracting appropriately.
3. **Solve for one variable**: After eliminating \( z \), the system is reduced to two equations with two variables (\( x \) and \( y \)). These are solved by eliminating \( x \) to find \( y \).
4. **Back-substitute**: Once \( y \) is found, it is substituted back to find \( x \), and then both are substituted to find \( z \).
5. **Output the results**: The values of \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) are the prices of upper-grade, middle-grade, and lower-grade silk in terms of plain silk.

---

### Final Answer:
The values of \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) (upper-grade, middle-grade, and lower-grade silk prices) are expressed as fractions of plain silk.
