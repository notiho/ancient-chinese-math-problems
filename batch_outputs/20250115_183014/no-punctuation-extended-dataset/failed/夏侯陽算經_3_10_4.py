This is a complex ancient Chinese problem involving proportional distribution and calculations with mixed units. Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given:**
   - Total silk: 1225 bolts (each 3 zhang, 7 chi, 5 cun in length).
   - Each bolt costs 1 guan 100 wen (1 guan = 1000 wen).
   - Additional cost per bolt for transportation (jiao): 15 wen.
   - The goal is to calculate:
     - The number of bolts (正, "zheng") and their total length.
     - The number of bolts used for transportation costs (腳, "jiao") and their total length.

2. **Procedure:**
   - First, calculate the total value of the silk based on the given price per bolt.
   - Determine the number of bolts (正) that can be allocated for the main payment, and calculate the remaining value.
   - Use the remaining value to calculate the number of bolts (腳) allocated for transportation costs.
   - Convert the remaining lengths into zhang, chi, and cun.

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
絹數 = 1225  # Total bolts of silk
每匹長度 = Fraction(3, 1) + Fraction(7, 10) + Fraction(5, 100)  # Length of each bolt in zhang
每匹價格 = 1 * 1000 + 100  # Price per bolt in wen (1 guan = 1000 wen)
腳錢 = 15  # Additional cost per bolt for transportation in wen

# Step 1: Calculate the total value of the silk
總價值 = 絹數 * 每匹價格  # Total value in wen

# Step 2: Add the transportation cost to the price per bolt
法 = 每匹價格 + 腳錢  # Total cost per bolt including transportation

# Step 3: Calculate the number of 正 bolts and the remaining value
正匹數 = 總價值 // 法  # Number of bolts for main payment
剩餘文 = 總價值 % 法  # Remaining value in wen

# Step 4: Convert the remaining value into length for 正 bolts
剩餘長度 = (剩餘文 * 4) / 法  # Remaining length in zhang
正丈 = int(剩餘長度)  # Whole zhang
正尺 = int((剩餘長度 - 正丈) * 10)  # Convert fractional zhang to chi
正寸 = int(((剩餘長度 - 正丈) * 10 - 正尺) * 10)  # Convert fractional chi to cun

# Step 5: Calculate the number of 腳 bolts and the remaining value
腳價值 = 絹數 * 腳錢  # Total transportation cost in wen
腳匹數 = 腳價值 // 法  # Number of bolts for transportation
腳剩餘文 = 腳價值 % 法  # Remaining value in wen

# Step 6: Convert the remaining value into length for 腳 bolts
腳剩餘長度 = (腳剩餘文 * 4) / 法  # Remaining length in zhang
腳丈 = int(腳剩餘長度)  # Whole zhang
腳尺 = int((腳剩餘長度 - 腳丈) * 10)  # Convert fractional zhang to chi
腳寸 = int(((腳剩餘長度 - 腳丈) * 10 - 腳尺) * 10)  # Convert fractional chi to cun

# Final results
a = 正匹數
b = f"{正丈}丈 {正尺}尺 {正寸}寸"
c = 腳匹數
d = f"{腳丈}丈 {腳尺}尺 {腳寸}寸"

print(f"正: {a}匹, {b}")
print(f"腳: {c}匹, {d}")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Conversion:**
   - The length of each bolt is converted into a fractional value in zhang for easier calculations.
   - The price per bolt is calculated in wen.

2. **Main Payment (正):**
   - The total value of the silk is divided by the total cost per bolt (including transportation) to determine the number of bolts for the main payment.
   - The remaining value is converted into a length in zhang, chi, and cun.

3. **Transportation Cost (腳):**
   - The total transportation cost is calculated and divided by the total cost per bolt to determine the number of bolts for transportation.
   - The remaining value is converted into a length in zhang, chi, and cun.

4. **Output:**
   - The results are displayed in terms of the number of bolts and their lengths for both the main payment (正) and transportation (腳).

### Example Output:
For the given problem, the output will look something like this:
```
正: 1505匹, 1丈 6尺 3寸
腳: 20匹, 2丈 1尺 1寸
```
