This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using the ancient Chinese method described in the "方程術" (method of equations). The goal is to determine the yield of one sheaf of upper, middle, and lower millet, given the total yields for different combinations of sheaves.

The problem can be translated into Python code as follows:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given equations:
# 3上禾 + 2中禾 + 1下禾 = 39斗
# 2上禾 + 3中禾 + 1下禾 = 34斗
# 1上禾 + 2中禾 + 3下禾 = 26斗

# Step 1: Represent the coefficients and constants
coefficients = [
    [3, 2, 1],  # Coefficients for the first equation
    [2, 3, 1],  # Coefficients for the second equation
    [1, 2, 3]   # Coefficients for the third equation
]
constants = [39, 34, 26]  # Right-hand side constants

# Step 2: Solve for 下禾 (lower millet)
# Using the first two equations to eliminate 上禾 and 中禾
法 = coefficients[0][0] * coefficients[1][1] - coefficients[0][1] * coefficients[1][0]
實 = constants[0] * coefficients[1][1] - constants[1] * coefficients[0][1]
下禾 = Fraction(實, 法)

# Step 3: Solve for 中禾 (middle millet)
# Substitute 下禾 into the first equation
法 = coefficients[0][0]
實 = constants[0] - coefficients[0][2] * 下禾
中禾 = Fraction(實, 法)

# Step 4: Solve for 上禾 (upper millet)
# Substitute 下禾 and 中禾 into the first equation
實 = constants[0] - coefficients[0][1] * 中禾 - coefficients[0][2] * 下禾
上禾 = Fraction(實, 法)

# Results
a, b = 上禾.numerator, 上禾.denominator
c, d = 中禾.numerator, 中禾.denominator
e, f = 下禾.numerator, 下禾.denominator

print(f"上禾 {a}秉 {b}斗, 中禾 {c}秉 {d}斗, 下禾 {e}秉 {f}斗")


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Step 1**: The coefficients of the equations and the constants are represented as lists.
2. **Step 2**: The method described in the problem is used to eliminate variables and solve for `下禾` (lower millet).
3. **Step 3**: Once `下禾` is determined, it is substituted back into the equations to solve for `中禾` (middle millet).
4. **Step 4**: Finally, `上禾` (upper millet) is solved using the remaining equation.

### Answer:
The result will be printed in the format:
```
上禾 a秉 b斗, 中禾 c秉 d斗, 下禾 e秉 f斗
```

This approach directly follows the ancient Chinese method of solving systems of linear equations.
