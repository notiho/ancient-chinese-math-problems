This problem involves solving a system of equations using the ancient Chinese method of "方程術" (fangcheng, or method of solving simultaneous linear equations). The problem describes three types of grain (甲禾, 乙禾, 丙禾) with given relationships between their weights. The goal is to determine the weight of one秉 (bundle) of each type of grain.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Data:**
   - 甲禾: 2 bundles weigh as much as 1 bundle of 乙禾.
   - 乙禾: 3 bundles weigh as much as 1 bundle of 丙禾.
   - 丙禾: 4 bundles weigh as much as 1 bundle of 甲禾.
   - Total weight of all bundles: 39斗.

2. **Procedure (術):**
   - Use the relationships between the weights to set up a system of equations.
   - Solve the equations using the "正負術" (positive-negative method) and "方程術" (method of solving equations).

3. **Answer:**
   - Determine the weight of 1 bundle of 甲禾, 乙禾, and 丙禾.

### Solution in Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Relationships between the weights:
# Let x = weight of 1 bundle of 甲禾 (in dou)
# Let y = weight of 1 bundle of 乙禾 (in dou)
# Let z = weight of 1 bundle of 丙禾 (in dou)

# Equations derived from the problem:
# 2x = y  (1)
# 3y = z  (2)
# 4z = x  (3)
# Total weight: 2x + 3y + 4z = 39 (4)

# Step 1: Express y and z in terms of x using equations (1), (2), and (3)
y = 2 * x  # From (1)
z = 3 * y  # From (2)
z = 3 * (2 * x)  # Substitute y = 2x
z = 6 * x  # Simplified

# Step 2: Substitute y and z into the total weight equation (4)
# 2x + 3y + 4z = 39
# Substitute y = 2x and z = 6x
total_weight = 2 * x + 3 * (2 * x) + 4 * (6 * x)
total_weight = 2 * x + 6 * x + 24 * x
total_weight = 32 * x

# Solve for x
x = Fraction(39, 32)  # Weight of 1 bundle of 甲禾

# Step 3: Calculate y and z
y = 2 * x  # Weight of 1 bundle of 乙禾
z = 6 * x  # Weight of 1 bundle of 丙禾

# Step 4: Calculate the number of bundles for each type of grain
# 甲禾: 2 bundles
# 乙禾: 3 bundles
# 丙禾: 4 bundles

# Step 5: Convert weights to 石 (1石 = 10斗)
a = 2  # Number of bundles of 甲禾
b = 2 * x / 10  # Total weight of 甲禾 in 石

c = 3  # Number of bundles of 乙禾
d = 3 * y / 10  # Total weight of 乙禾 in 石

e = 4  # Number of bundles of 丙禾
f = 4 * z / 10  # Total weight of 丙禾 in 石

# Final Answer
a = 2  # 甲禾 bundles
b = b  # 甲禾 weight in 石
c = 3  # 乙禾 bundles
d = d  # 乙禾 weight in 石
e = 4  # 丙禾 bundles
f = f  # 丙禾 weight in 石

# Print results
print(f"甲禾 {a}秉 重 {b}石")
print(f"乙禾 {c}秉 重 {d}石")
print(f"丙禾 {e}秉 重 {f}石")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Variable Definitions:**
   - `x`, `y`, and `z` represent the weights of 1 bundle of 甲禾, 乙禾, and 丙禾, respectively.
   - Relationships between weights are derived from the problem statement.

2. **Substitution:**
   - Using the relationships, `y` and `z` are expressed in terms of `x`.

3. **Total Weight Equation:**
   - The total weight equation is solved to find `x`.

4. **Conversion to 石:**
   - Since 1石 = 10斗, the weights are converted to 石 for the final answer.

5. **Output:**
   - The results are printed in the required format.

---

### Final Answer:
- 甲禾 2秉 重 \( b \)石
- 乙禾 3秉 重 \( d \)石
- 丙禾 4秉 重 \( f \)石
