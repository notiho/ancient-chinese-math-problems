Suppose there is a valley with the following dimensions:
- The top width is 2 zhang, and the top length is 7 zhang.
- The bottom width is 8 chi, and the bottom length is 4 zhang.
- The depth is 6 zhang and 5 chi.

Question 1: What is the total volume of the valley?
Answer: 52000 cubic chi.

Additionally:
- The soil is transported back and forth for 200 bu.
- The distance between the loading and unloading points is 1 li.
- The total journey is 58 li.
- There are 6 people sharing a cart.
- The cart carries 34 chi and 7 cun of soil per trip.

Question 2: How much soil does each person transport, and how many people are needed in total?

The procedure says:
- Multiply the soil carried by one cart by the total journey in bu to get the dividend.
- Add the back-and-forth steps (200 bu) to the 1 li distance (converted to bu), and multiply by the 6 people sharing the cart to get the divisor.
- Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the amount of soil transported by one person.
- Use the total volume of soil and divide it by the amount transported by one person to find the total number of people required.

Answer: Each person transports *a* cubic chi, and *b* people are required.

# Question 1: Calculate the total volume of the valley.

# Dimensions
上廣 = 2 * 10  # Convert zhang to chi
上袤 = 7 * 10  # Convert zhang to chi
下廣 = 8       # Already in chi
下袤 = 4 * 10  # Convert zhang to chi
深 = 6 * 10 + 5  # Convert depth to chi (6 zhang 5 chi)

# Volume formula for a truncated prism: V = (1/2) * 深 * (上面積 + 下面積)
上面積 = 上廣 * 上袤
下面積 = 下廣 * 下袤
積 = Fraction(1, 2) * 深 * (上面積 + 下面積)

# Total volume in cubic chi
積 = int(積)  # Convert to integer since the answer is exact
assert 積 == 52000  # Confirm the result matches the given answer

# Question 2: Calculate the soil transported by each person and the total number of people needed.

# Given values
車載積尺 = 34 + Fraction(7, 10)  # Convert 34 chi 7 cun to chi
程行步數 = 58 * 300  # Convert li to bu (1 li = 300 bu)
往來步數 = 200
載輸之間 = 1 * 300  # Convert 1 li to bu
車人數 = 6

# Calculate the divisor
法 = (往來步數 + 載輸之間) * 車人數

# Calculate the dividend
實 = 車載積尺 * 程行步數

# Soil transported by one person
人到積尺 = Fraction(實, 法)

# Total number of people needed
用徒人數 = Fraction(積, 人到積尺)

# Convert to integers for the final answer
a = int(人到積尺)
b = int(用徒人數)

# Final answers
