今有女子善織日自倍五日織通五尺問日織幾何

Suppose there is a woman skilled in weaving. Each day, she doubles her output.
In five days, she weaves a total of 5 chi.
Question: how much does she weave each day?

The procedure says: Place the outputs for each day in a sequence, decreasing by doubling.
Add these, obtaining 31 as the divisor.
Multiply the total 5 chi by the individual terms of the sequence, each becoming a dividend.
Divide each dividend by the divisor, obtaining the daily outputs.

Answer: On the first day, she weaves *a* cun. On the second day, she weaves *b* cun. On the third day, she weaves *c* cun. On the fourth day, she weaves *d* chi. On the fifth day, she weaves *e* chi.
