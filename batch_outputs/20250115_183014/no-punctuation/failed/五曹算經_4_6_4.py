Suppose there is a granary with a length of 1 zhang 3 chi, a width of 6 chi, and a height of 1 zhang. 
Inside, there are:
- 2 vertical beams, each square with a side of 5 cun, and a length equal to the granary's length (1 zhang 3 chi).
- 3 horizontal beams, each square with a side of 4 cun, and a length equal to the granary's width (6 chi).
- 1 pillar, circular with a circumference of 3 chi and a height equal to the granary's height (1 zhang).

Question: How much millet can the granary hold?

The procedure says:
1. Convert the length (1 zhang 3 chi) into cun by multiplying by 10, obtaining 130 cun. Multiply by the width (60 cun), obtaining 7800 cun². Then multiply by the height (100 cun), obtaining 780,000 cun³ as the total volume.
2. For the vertical beams:
   - Each beam is square with a side of 5 cun. Multiply 5 cun by itself to get 25 cun². Multiply by the length (130 cun), obtaining 3250 cun³. Multiply by 2 beams, obtaining 6500 cun³.
3. For the horizontal beams:
   - Each beam is square with a side of 4 cun. Multiply 4 cun by itself to get 16 cun². Multiply by the width (60 cun), obtaining 960 cun³. Multiply by 3 beams, obtaining 2880 cun³.
4. For the pillar:
   - The pillar is circular with a circumference of 30 cun. Divide the circumference by π (approximated as 3) to get the diameter (10 cun). Multiply half the diameter (5 cun) by itself to get the radius squared (25 cun²). Multiply by π (approximated as 3) to get the cross-sectional area (75 cun²). Multiply by the height (100 cun), obtaining 7500 cun³.
5. Add the volumes of the vertical beams, horizontal beams, and pillar, obtaining 16,880 cun³. Subtract this from the total volume, leaving 763,120 cun³.
6. Divide by the millet conversion factor (1620 cun³ per hu) to get the number of hu and remaining cun³.

Answer: *a* hu and *b* cun³.
