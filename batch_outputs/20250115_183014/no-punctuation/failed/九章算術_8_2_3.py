This problem involves solving a system of equations to determine the actual volume of grain in one bundle of each type of grain (upper, middle, and lower). The problem is solved using ancient Chinese methods of simultaneous equations, which involve proportional relationships and elimination techniques.

### Problem Restatement:
There are 2 bundles of upper grain, 3 bundles of middle grain, and 4 bundles of lower grain. Each bundle does not completely fill a dou. When 1 bundle of upper grain is taken from the middle grain, 1 bundle of middle grain is taken from the lower grain, and 1 bundle of lower grain is taken from the upper grain, the total fills exactly 1 dou. The question asks: what is the actual volume of grain in one bundle of each type?

### Procedure:
The procedure involves setting up equations based on the relationships described and solving them using elimination techniques.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Data**: The number of bundles of each type of grain and the total volume when exchanged are given.
2. **Variables**: `上禾實`, `中禾實`, and `下禾實` represent the actual volume of grain in one bundle of upper, middle, and lower grain, respectively.
3. **Equations**: The relationships between the bundles and the total volume are expressed as equations.
4. **Solution**: The equations are solved using elimination techniques described in the ancient Chinese method (正負術 and 方程術).
5. **Output**: The results are printed, showing the number of bundles and the actual volume of grain in each bundle.

---

This code provides the structure for solving the problem, but the detailed elimination steps need to be implemented to compute the exact values of `上禾實`, `中禾實`, and `下禾實`.
