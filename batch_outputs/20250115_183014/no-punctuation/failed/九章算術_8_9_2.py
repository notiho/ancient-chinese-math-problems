This is a classic problem involving simultaneous equations. The problem can be solved using the ancient Chinese method of "方程術" (fangcheng, or method of solving systems of linear equations). Below is the translation of the problem into Python code, following the procedure described.

### Problem:
Suppose there are two people, Jia (甲) and Yi (乙), holding an unknown amount of money.  
- Jia takes half of Yi's money and has 50 qian.  
- Yi takes more than half of Jia's money and also has 50 qian.  
Question: How much money does Jia and Yi each hold?

### Procedure:
The procedure for solving this uses the "方程術" (method of equations). It involves setting up and solving a system of linear equations. Below is the Python implementation.


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Let Jia's money be x and Yi's money be y.

# Equation 1: Jia takes half of Yi's money and has 50 qian.
# x + (1/2)y = 50
# Rearrange: 2x + y = 100
# This is the first equation.

# Equation 2: Yi takes more than half of Jia's money and also has 50 qian.
# y + (3/2)x = 50
# Rearrange: 3x + 2y = 100
# This is the second equation.

# Solve the system of equations using the method described in 方程術.

# Step 1: Define the coefficients of the equations.
# Equation 1: 2x + y = 100
a1, b1, c1 = 2, 1, 100

# Equation 2: 3x + 2y = 100
a2, b2, c2 = 3, 2, 100

# Step 2: Eliminate one variable (y) by aligning coefficients and subtracting equations.
# Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to align the coefficients of y.
# 4x + 2y = 200  (First equation multiplied by 2)
# 3x + 2y = 100  (Second equation as is)

# Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate y.
# (4x + 2y) - (3x + 2y) = 200 - 100
# x = 100

# Step 3: Substitute x = 100 into one of the original equations to solve for y.
# Using the first equation: 2x + y = 100
# 2(100) + y = 100
# 200 + y = 100
# y = -100

# Step 4: Assign the results.
a = x
b = y

# Answer:
a = 100  # Jia's money
b = -100  # Yi's money
