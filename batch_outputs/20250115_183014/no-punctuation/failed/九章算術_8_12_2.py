This problem involves solving a system of equations using ancient Chinese "fangcheng" (方程) methods, which is equivalent to solving simultaneous linear equations. The problem describes a scenario where five households share a well, and the lengths of their ropes are related to each other in a specific way. The goal is to determine the depth of the well and the length of each household's rope.

The procedure for solving this problem involves setting up the equations based on the relationships described and solving them using the "fangcheng" method. Here's the Python implementation:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Relationships between the rope lengths and the well depth:
# Let the well depth be `井深 = a` (in zhang), and the rope lengths be:
# 甲綆長 = b (in zhang), 乙綆長 = c (in zhang), 丙綆長 = d (in zhang),
# 丁綆長 = e (in zhang), 戊綆長 = f (in zhang).

# Equations based on the problem:
# 1. b = a - 2
# 2. c = a - 3
# 3. d = a - 4
# 4. e = a - 5
# 5. f = a - 6

# To solve for `a`, we use the fact that each household's rope is exactly 1 zhang short of reaching the well bottom.

# Step 1: Solve for the well depth (a).
# Since all ropes are 1 zhang short, the depth of the well is determined by the longest rope plus 1 zhang.
井深 = 6 + 1  # a = 6 zhang + 1 zhang = 7 zhang

# Step 2: Solve for the rope lengths.
甲綆長 = 井深 - 2  # b = a - 2
乙綆長 = 井深 - 3  # c = a - 3
丙綆長 = 井深 - 4  # d = a - 4
丁綆長 = 井深 - 5  # e = a - 5
戊綆長 = 井深 - 6  # f = a - 6

# Convert the results to fractions for precision.
a = Fraction(井深)
b = Fraction(甲綆長)
c = Fraction(乙綆長)
d = Fraction(丙綆長)
e = Fraction(丁綆長)
f = Fraction(戊綆長)

# Output the results.
print(f"井深: {a} 丈")
print(f"甲綆長: {b} 丈")
print(f"乙綆長: {c} 丈")
print(f"丙綆長: {d} 丈")
print(f"丁綆長: {e} 丈")
print(f"戊綆長: {f} 丈")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Equations Setup**: The relationships between the well depth and the rope lengths are directly derived from the problem statement.
2. **Well Depth Calculation**: The well depth is determined by the longest rope (戊綆長) plus 1 zhang, as each rope is 1 zhang short of reaching the bottom.
3. **Rope Lengths Calculation**: Each rope length is calculated based on the well depth and the given relationships.
4. **Fractions for Precision**: The `Fraction` class is used to ensure precise calculations without floating-point errors.
5. **Output**: The results are printed in terms of zhang.

### Final Answer:
- 井深 (Well Depth): 7 丈
- 甲綆長 (Rope Length of Household A): 5 丈
- 乙綆長 (Rope Length of Household B): 4 丈
- 丙綆長 (Rope Length of Household C): 3 丈
- 丁綆長 (Rope Length of Household D): 2 丈
- 戊綆長 (Rope Length of Household E): 1 丈
