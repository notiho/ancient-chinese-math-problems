This problem involves solving a system of equations using ancient Chinese methods, specifically the "正負術" (positive and negative method) and "方程術" (method of simultaneous equations). Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.

### Problem Description:
There are three types of grain: Jia (甲), Yi (乙), and Bing (丙). Their weights are all greater than one shi (石). The relationships between their weights are as follows:
1. Two Jia grains weigh as much as one Yi grain.
2. Three Yi grains weigh as much as one Bing grain.
3. Four Bing grains weigh as much as one Jia grain.

The goal is to determine the weight of one unit of each type of grain.

### Procedure:
The "方程術" (method of simultaneous equations) is used to solve this problem. The relationships are translated into equations, and the solution is obtained by systematically eliminating variables.

from fractions import Fraction

# Relationships between the grains:
# 1. Two Jia grains weigh as much as one Yi grain.
# 2. Three Yi grains weigh as much as one Bing grain.
# 3. Four Bing grains weigh as much as one Jia grain.

# Let the weights of one unit of Jia, Yi, and Bing grains be x, y, and z respectively.

# Equation 1: 2x = y
# Equation 2: 3y = z
# Equation 3: 4z = x

# Step 1: Express y in terms of x from Equation 1
y = 2 * Fraction(1, 2)  # y = 2x

# Step 2: Express z in terms of y from Equation 2
z = 3 * Fraction(1, 3)  # z = 3y

# Step 3: Express x in terms of z from Equation 3
x = 4 * Fraction(1, 4)  # x = 4z

# Step 4: Solve for x, y, z
# Substitute z into x and y
x = Fraction(1, 4)
y = Fraction(1, 2)
z = Fraction(1, 3)

# Output the results
a, b = 1, x
c, d = 1, y
e, f = 1, z

print(f"甲禾 {a}秉 重 {b}石")
print(f"乙禾 {c}秉 重 {d}石")
print(f"丙禾 {e}秉 重 {f}石")


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Equations**: The relationships between the weights are translated into equations.
   - Equation 1: \( 2x = y \)
   - Equation 2: \( 3y = z \)
   - Equation 3: \( 4z = x \)
2. **Substitution**: The equations are solved step by step using substitution to express each variable in terms of the others.
3. **Fractions**: The `Fraction` class is used to ensure exact arithmetic for non-integer results.
4. **Output**: The results are printed in the required format.

### Final Answer:
- 甲禾 \( a = 1 \) 秉, 重 \( b = \frac{1}{4} \) 石
- 乙禾 \( c = 1 \) 秉, 重 \( d = \frac{1}{2} \) 石
- 丙禾 \( e = 1 \) 秉, 重 \( f = \frac{1}{3} \) 石
