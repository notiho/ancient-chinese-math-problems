"""

To solve this problem, we will use the ancient Chinese method of solving simultaneous linear equations, as described in the "方程術" (fangcheng method). Here's the problem and solution encoded in Python:

"""
Suppose there are 5 oxen and 2 sheep worth 10 liang of gold.
And 2 oxen and 5 sheep worth 8 liang of gold.
Question: how much is each ox and each sheep worth in gold?

The procedure says: Use the fangcheng method.
The fangcheng method says: Place the coefficients of the equations in rows (the "禾"), and the constants (the "實") on the right side.
Perform row operations to eliminate variables and solve for each unknown.

Answer: Each ox is worth *a* liang of gold, and each sheep is worth *b* liang of gold.

# Coefficients of the equations
# 牛5羊2直金10 (5 oxen + 2 sheep = 10 liang)
# 牛2羊5直金8  (2 oxen + 5 sheep = 8 liang)
coefficients = [
    [5, 2, 10],  # First equation: 5x + 2y = 10
    [2, 5, 8]    # Second equation: 2x + 5y = 8
]

# Step 1: Eliminate the first variable (牛, x) in the second row
# Multiply the first row by 2 and the second row by 5, then subtract
factor1 = coefficients[1][0]  # Coefficient of x in the second row
factor2 = coefficients[0][0]  # Coefficient of x in the first row

# Scale the rows
row1_scaled = [factor1 * value for value in coefficients[0]]
row2_scaled = [factor2 * value for value in coefficients[1]]

# Subtract to eliminate x
row2_new = [row2_scaled[i] - row1_scaled[i] for i in range(len(row1_scaled))]

# Update the system of equations
coefficients[1] = row2_new

# Step 2: Solve for the second variable (羊, y)
# The second row now represents 11y = 16
y = Fraction(coefficients[1][2], coefficients[1][1])

# Step 3: Solve for the first variable (牛, x)
# Substitute y back into the first equation
x = Fraction(coefficients[0][2] - coefficients[0][1] * y, coefficients[0][0])

# Results
a = x  # 牛 (ox) worth in liang
b = y  # 羊 (sheep) worth in liang

a, b  # Output the results
