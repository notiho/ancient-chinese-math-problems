This problem involves solving a system of equations using the ancient Chinese method of "方程術" (method of solving simultaneous equations). The problem is stated as follows:

"""
Suppose there are three types of grain: Jia grain (甲禾), Yi grain (乙禾), and Bing grain (丙禾). 
Jia grain has 2 bundles, Yi grain has 3 bundles, and Bing grain has 4 bundles. 
The total weight exceeds 1 shi (石). 
The relationships between their weights are as follows:
- The weight of 2 bundles of Jia grain equals the weight of 1 bundle of Yi grain.
- The weight of 3 bundles of Yi grain equals the weight of 1 bundle of Bing grain.
- The weight of 4 bundles of Bing grain equals the weight of 1 bundle of Jia grain.

Question: What is the weight of 1 bundle of Jia grain, Yi grain, and Bing grain?

The procedure says: Use the method of simultaneous equations. Place the excess weight over 1 shi as negative. Use the positive-negative method to solve.

The answer says: Jia grain has *a* bundles, weighing *b* shi. Yi grain has *c* bundles, weighing *d* shi. Bing grain has *e* bundles, weighing *f* shi.

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the relationships between the grains
# 2 bundles of Jia = 1 bundle of Yi
# 3 bundles of Yi = 1 bundle of Bing
# 4 bundles of Bing = 1 bundle of Jia

# Let x = weight of 1 bundle of Jia grain
# Let y = weight of 1 bundle of Yi grain
# Let z = weight of 1 bundle of Bing grain

# From the relationships:
# 2x = y
# 3y = z
# 4z = x

# Solve for x, y, z using substitution:
# From 2x = y, we get y = 2x
# From 3y = z, substituting y = 2x, we get z = 3(2x) = 6x
# From 4z = x, substituting z = 6x, we get 4(6x) = x
# Simplify: 24x = x
# Therefore, x = 0 (This is incorrect; the problem needs clarification.)
