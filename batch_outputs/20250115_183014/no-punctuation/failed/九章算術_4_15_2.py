Suppose there is a volume of 3,970,215,625 bu^3.
Question: what is the side length of the square field?

The procedure for square root extraction says:
1. Place the volume as the dividend.
2. Borrow a counting rod for the side length, exceeding one rank [digit].
3. Discuss the result obtained, multiply it by 1, and use the borrowed counting rod as the divisor.
4. Divide the dividend by the divisor. Double the divisor to establish the fixed divisor.
5. Continue dividing, adjusting the divisor as necessary, and repeat the process.
6. If the square root cannot be fully extracted, it is considered unsolvable, and the result should be expressed in terms of the area.
7. If the volume has fractions, convert them into a common fraction and treat the numerator as the dividend.
8. Extract the square root of the numerator and denominator separately. If the denominator cannot be extracted, multiply it by the numerator and extract the square root again.

Answer: *a* bu.
