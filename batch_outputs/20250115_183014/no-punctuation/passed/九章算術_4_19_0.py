The problem involves finding the cube root of a given volume, expressed as \(1953 \frac{1}{8}\) cubic chi. The procedure for extracting cube roots is described in detail in the ancient Chinese mathematical text, and we will translate this into Python code step by step.

### Problem Statement:
Suppose there is a volume of \(1953 \frac{1}{8}\) cubic chi.  
Question: What is the side length of the cube?

### Procedure:
The procedure for extracting cube roots says:
1. Place the volume as the dividend.
2. Borrow a counting rod (a trial number) and test it by squaring and multiplying to find the divisor.
3. Divide the dividend by the divisor to get the quotient.
4. Multiply the quotient by 3 to form the "fixed divisor."
5. Subtract and bring down the next digit, repeating the process.
6. If the volume has fractions, convert everything to a common denominator and proceed as above.
7. If the denominator cannot be perfectly extracted, multiply the numerator by the square of the denominator and proceed.

The answer will be the side length of the cube, \(a\) chi.

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 積一千九百五十三尺八分尺之一
積 = Fraction(1953, 1) + Fraction(1, 8)

# 開立方術
def 開立方(積):
    # 通分內子為定實
    定實 = 積  # The volume to be processed
    母 = 定實.denominator  # Denominator of the fraction
    子 = 定實.numerator  # Numerator of the fraction

    # If the denominator is not a perfect cube, adjust the numerator
    if round(母 ** (1/3)) ** 3 != 母:
        子 = 子 * (母 ** 2)
        母 = 母 ** 3

    # 開其母
    開母 = round(母 ** (1/3))

    # 開其子
    開子 = 0
    while 開子 ** 3 <= 子:
        開子 += 1
    開子 -= 1

    # Combine the results
    開方結果 = Fraction(開子, 開母)
    return 開方結果

# 計算結果
a = 開立方(積)
print(f"Answer: {a} chi")


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Volume**: The volume \(1953 \frac{1}{8}\) is converted into a Fraction object for precise calculations.
2. **Common Denominator**: If the denominator of the fraction is not a perfect cube, the numerator is adjusted by multiplying it by the square of the denominator, and the denominator is cubed.
3. **Cube Root Extraction**: The cube root of the numerator and denominator is calculated separately. If the denominator is not a perfect cube, the procedure adjusts accordingly.
4. **Result**: The cube root is returned as a Fraction, representing the side length of the cube.

### Answer:
The side length of the cube is \(a\) chi, where \(a\) is the result of the cube root extraction.
