Let's break it down and solve it step by step in Python.\n\n---\n\n### Problem Breakdown:\n1. The granary has dimensions:\n   - Length (\u5f9e): 1 \u4e08 3 \u5c3a = 13 \u5c3a\n   - Width (\u5ee3): 6 \u5c3a\n   - Height (\u9ad8): 1 \u4e08 = 10 \u5c3a\n\n2. Inside the granary:\n   - There are **2 beams (\u727d)** along the length, each with a square cross-section of 5 \u5bf8 \u00d7 5 \u5bf8.\n   - There are **3 beams (\u727d)** along the width, each with a square cross-section of 4 \u5bf8 \u00d7 4 \u5bf8.\n   - There is **1 pillar (\u67f1)** with a circular cross-section of \u5468 (circumference) 3 \u5c3a and height 10 \u5c3a.\n\n3. The task is to calculate the remaining volume of the granary (after accounting for the beams and pillar) and determine how much millet (\u7c9f) it can hold.
