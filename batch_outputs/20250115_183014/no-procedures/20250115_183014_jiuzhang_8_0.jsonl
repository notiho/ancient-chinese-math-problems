From \\( x + y + z = 60 \\) and \\( x + y = 40 \\):\n   \\[\n   z = 60 - 40 = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. From \\( x + y + z = 60 \\) and \\( y + z = 40 \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 60 - 40 = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. From \\( x + y + z = 60 \\) and \\( z + x = 40 \\):\n   \\[\n   y = 60 - 40 = 20\n   \\]\n\n#### Step 3: Verify the solution.\n\n- \\( x = 20 \\), \\( y = 20 \\), \\( z = 20 \\).\n- Substituting back into the original equations:\n  - \\( x + y = 20 + 20 = 40 \\) (correct).\n  - \\( y + z = 20 + 20 = 40 \\) (correct).\n  - \\( z + x = 20 + 20 = 40 \\) (correct).\n\nThus, the pulling power of each type of horse is:\n- Wu Ma: \\( 1 \\) horse pulls \\( 20 \\) shi.\n- Zhong Ma: \\( 1 \\) horse pulls \\( 20 \\) shi.\n- Xia Ma: \\( 1 \\) horse pulls \\( 20 \\) shi.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n- \u6b66\u99ac \\( a = 1 \\), \u529b\u5f15 \\( b = 20 \\) \u77f3.\n- \u4e2d\u99ac \\( c = 1 \\), \u529b\u5f15 \\( d = 20 \\) \u77f3.\n- \u4e0b\u99ac \\( e = 1 \\), \u529b\u5f15 \\( f = 20 \\) \u77f3.\n\nHere is the Python code to represent the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Let x, y, z represent the pulling power of Wu Ma, Zhong Ma, and Xia Ma respectively.\n# Solve the equations:\n# x + y = 40\n# y + z = 40\n# z + x = 40\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total pulling power\ntotal_power = 60  # x + y + z = 60\n\n# Step 2: Solve for each variable\nx = Fraction(20)  # Wu Ma's pulling power\ny = Fraction(20)  # Zhong Ma's pulling power\nz = Fraction(20)  # Xia Ma's pulling power\n\n# Output the results\na, b = 1, x  # Wu Ma\nc, d = 1, y  # Zhong Ma\ne, f = 1, z  # Xia Ma\n\nprint(f\"\u6b66\u99ac {a}\u5339 \u529b\u5f15 {b}\u77f3\")\nprint(f\"\u4e2d\u99ac {c}\u5339 \u529b\u5f15 {d}\u77f3\")\nprint(f\"\u4e0b\u99ac {e}\u5339 \u529b\u5f15 {f}\u77f3\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\n\u6b66\u99ac 1\u5339 \u529b\u5f15 20\u77f3\n\u4e2d\u99ac 1\u5339 \u529b\u5f15 20\u77f3\n\u4e0b\u99ac 1\u5339 \u529b\u5f15 20\u77f3\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 3, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is a classic ancient Chinese math problem involving horses of different strengths (Wu horse, Zhong horse, and Xia horse) and their ability to pull loads.
