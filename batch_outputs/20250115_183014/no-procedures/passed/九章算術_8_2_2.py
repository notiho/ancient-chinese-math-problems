今有上禾二秉，中禾三秉，下禾四秉，實皆不滿斗。上取中，中取下，下取上各一秉而實滿斗。問︰上、中、下禾實一秉各幾何？
荅曰：上禾 a秉 實 b斗 ，中禾 c秉 實 d斗 ，下禾 e秉 實 f斗 。

Suppose there are three types of grain: upper grain (2 bundles), middle grain (3 bundles), and lower grain (4 bundles). Each bundle is less than 1 dou in volume. 
If the upper grain takes 1 bundle from the middle grain, the middle grain takes 1 bundle from the lower grain, and the lower grain takes 1 bundle from the upper grain, then each type of grain becomes exactly 1 dou in volume.

Question: How much volume does each bundle of upper, middle, and lower grain contain?

Answer: Each bundle of upper grain is *a* bundles and contains *b* dou, each bundle of middle grain is *c* bundles and contains *d* dou, and each bundle of lower grain is *e* bundles and contains *f* dou.

# Let the volume of each bundle of upper, middle, and lower grain be x, y, and z respectively.
# Given:
# 2x + y = 1 (upper grain becomes 1 dou)
# 3y + z = 1 (middle grain becomes 1 dou)
# 4z + x = 1 (lower grain becomes 1 dou)

# Solve the system of equations step by step:
# From the first equation: y = 1 - 2x
# Substitute y into the second equation: 3(1 - 2x) + z = 1
# Simplify: 3 - 6x + z = 1 -> z = 6x - 2
# Substitute z into the third equation: 4(6x - 2) + x = 1
# Simplify: 24x - 8 + x = 1 -> 25x = 9 -> x = 9/25

# Now calculate y and z:
x = Fraction(9, 25)
y = 1 - 2 * x
z = 6 * x - 2

# Results:
a, b = 1, x  # Upper grain: 1 bundle contains x dou
c, d = 1, y  # Middle grain: 1 bundle contains y dou
e, f = 1, z  # Lower grain: 1 bundle contains z dou

a, b, c, d, e, f
