Suppose there is a total area of 55,225 square bu.
Question: what is the side length of the square field?

Answer: the side length is *a* bu.

# 積五萬五千二百二十五步
積 = 55225

# To find the side length of the square, take the square root of the area
# The square root of a number is the number whose square equals the given area
# In this case, we find the square root of 55225 manually.

# Calculate the side length
a = 235  # Since 235 * 235 = 55225

# Final answer
a
