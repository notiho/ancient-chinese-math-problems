Let's solve it step by step using Python.\n\n### Problem Breakdown:\n1. The distance between Chang'an and Qi is 3000 li.\n2. The **good horse (\u826f\u99ac)** starts by traveling 193 li on the first day and increases its daily travel by 13 li each day.\n3. The **slow horse (\u99d1\u99ac)** starts by traveling 97 li on the first day and decreases its daily travel by 0.5 li each day.\n4. The good horse reaches Qi first, then returns to meet the slow horse.\n5. We need to calculate:\n   - The number of days (*a*) until they meet.\n   - The total distance traveled by the good horse (*b*).\n   - The total distance traveled by the slow horse (*c*).\n\nHere is the Python solution:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Given data\ndistance = 3000  # Distance between Chang'an and Qi in li\ngood_horse_start = 193  # Initial daily distance of the good horse in li\ngood_horse_increase = 13  # Daily increase in distance for the good horse in li\nslow_horse_start = 97  # Initial daily distance of the slow horse in li\nslow_horse_decrease = Fraction(1, 2)  # Daily decrease in distance for the slow horse in li\n\n# Initialize variables\ngood_horse_distance = 0  # Total distance traveled by the good horse\nslow_horse_distance = 0  # Total distance traveled by the slow horse\nday = 0  # Day counter\n\n# Daily distances\ngood_horse_daily = good_horse_start\nslow_horse_daily = slow_horse_start\n\n# Phase 1: Good horse reaches Qi\nwhile good_horse_distance < distance:\n    day += 1\n    good_horse_distance += good_horse_daily\n    good_horse_daily += good_horse_increase\n\n# Good horse has reached Qi, now it starts returning\ngood_horse_daily -= good_horse_increase  # Adjust for the last increment\n\n# Phase 2: Good horse returns to meet the slow horse\nwhile slow_horse_distance < good_horse_distance:\n    day += 1\n    good_horse_distance += good_horse_daily\n    slow_horse_distance += slow_horse_daily\n    good_horse_daily += good_horse_increase\n    slow_horse_daily -= slow_horse_decrease\n\n# Results\na = day  # Number of days until they meet\nb = good_horse_distance  # Total distance traveled by the good horse\nc = slow_horse_distance  # Total distance traveled by the slow horse\n\n# Output the results\na, b, c\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Phase 1**: The good horse travels to Qi. We calculate the total distance it travels using an arithmetic progression until it reaches 3000 li.\n2. **Phase 2**: The good horse starts returning, and the slow horse continues moving forward. We calculate their respective distances day by day until they meet.\n3.
