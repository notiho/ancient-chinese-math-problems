Let's break it down and solve it step by step.\n\n### Problem:\nWe are given:\n1. Total millet: 5140 \u77f3.\n2. Two granaries: one square and one circular.\n3. The top opening (\u53e3) is smaller than the bottom (\u5e95), and the depth (\u6df1) is the same for both granaries.\n4. The depth is 7 \u5c3a less than the bottom diameter and 1 \u4e08 4 \u5c3a (14 \u5c3a) more than the top diameter.\n5. Both granaries are filled to capacity, and the total millet is distributed equally between them.\n\nWe need to find:\n- The top diameter (\u4e0a\u65b9\u5f91, `a` \u5c3a),\n- The bottom diameter (\u4e0b\u65b9\u5f91, `b` \u4e08),\n- The depth (\u6df1, `c` \u4e08).\n\n---\n\n### Solution:\n\nWe will use the formulas for the volumes of the square and circular granaries. The square granary has a square cross-section, while the circular granary has a circular cross-section.\n\n#### Step 1: Define variables\nLet:\n- `a` = top diameter (in \u5c3a),\n- `b` = bottom diameter (in \u4e08, convert to \u5c3a for calculations),\n- `c` = depth (in \u4e08, convert to \u5c3a for calculations).\n\n#### Step 2: Relationships between dimensions\nFrom the problem:\n1. \\( c = b \\times 10 - 7 \\) (depth is 7 \u5c3a less than the bottom diameter in \u5c3a),\n2. \\( c = a + 14 \\) (depth is 14 \u5c3a more than the top diameter in \u5c3a).\n\nEquating the two expressions for \\( c \\):\n\\[\nb \\times 10 - 7 = a + 14\n\\]\n\\[\na = b \\times 10 - 21\n\\]\n\n#### Step 3: Volume formulas\nThe total millet is 5140 \u77f3, so each granary holds \\( \\frac{5140}{2} = 2570 \\) \u77f3.\n\n1. **Square granary volume**:\n   The volume of the square granary is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{square}} = \\frac{c}{3} \\times (a^2 + a \\times b \\times 10 + (b \\times 10)^2)\n   \\]\n   where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\times 10 \\) are the top and bottom diameters in \u5c3a, and \\( c \\) is the depth in \u5c3a.\n\n2. **Circular granary volume**:\n   The volume of the circular granary is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{circle}} = \\frac{c}{3} \\times \\pi \\times \\left( \\frac{a^2 + a \\times b \\times 10 + (b \\times 10)^2}{4} \\right)\n   \\]\n\nBoth volumes must equal 2570 \u77f3.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Solve for dimensions\nUsing the relationships and equations above, we solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). For simplicity, we approximate \\( \\pi \\) as \\( \\frac{22}{7} \\).\n\n1. Substitute \\( a = b \\times 10 - 21 \\) and \\( c = b \\times 10 - 7 \\) into the volume equations.\n2.

The **depth** of the granaries (`c` zhang).\n\n---\n\n### Assumptions:\n1. 1 zhang = 10 chi.\n2. The volume of a square granary is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{square}} = \\frac{h}{3} \\times (A^2 + AB + B^2)\n   \\]\n   where \\( A \\) is the top side, \\( B \\) is the bottom side, and \\( h \\) is the depth.\n3. The volume of a circular granary is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{circular}} = \\frac{h}{3} \\times \\pi \\times \\left( \\frac{d_1^2 + d_1 d_2 + d_2^2}{4} \\right)\n   \\]\n   where \\( d_1 \\) is the top diameter, \\( d_2 \\) is the bottom diameter, and \\( h \\) is the depth.\n4.

The code uses the formula for the volume of square and circular granaries.\n2. It iteratively solves for the top side (`A`) of the square granary such that the total volume matches the given millet volume.\n3. Once `A` is found, the bottom side (`B`) and depth (`h`) are calculated using the given relationships.\n4.
