This problem involves solving a system of linear equations to determine the price of one dou of each type of grain. Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.

The problem gives us the following equations:

1. \( 9a + 7b + 3c + 2d + 5e = 140 \)
2. \( 7a + 6b + 4c + 5d + 3e = 128 \)
3. \( 3a + 5b + 7c + 6d + 4e = 116 \)
4. \( 2a + 5b + 3c + 9d + 4e = 112 \)
5. \( 1a + 3b + 2c + 8d + 5e = 95 \)

Where:
- \( a \) is the price of one dou of 麻 (hemp),
- \( b \) is the price of one dou of 麥 (wheat),
- \( c \) is the price of one dou of 菽 (beans),
- \( d \) is the price of one dou of 答 (rice),
- \( e \) is the price of one dou of 黍 (millet).

The goal is to solve for \( a, b, c, d, e \).

Here is the Python code to solve this system of equations:

### Explanation:
1. The `coefficients` list contains the coefficients of the variables \( a, b, c, d, e \) in each equation.
2. The `constants` list contains the total price for each equation.
3. The `gaussian_elimination` function performs Gaussian elimination to solve the system of linear equations.
4. The solution is printed as the price of one dou of each type of grain.

### Output:
The output will give the price of one dou of 麻, 麥, 菽, 答, and 黍 in terms of 錢 (money).
