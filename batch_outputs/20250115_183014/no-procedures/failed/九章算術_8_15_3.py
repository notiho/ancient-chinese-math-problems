今有令一人、吏五人、從者一十人，食雞一十；令一十人、吏一人、從者五人，食雞八；令五人、吏一十人、從者一人，食雞六。問︰令、吏、從者食雞各幾何？

This is a classic system of linear equations problem. Let's solve it step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
We are tasked with finding how many chickens each type of person (令, 吏, 從者) consumes. Let:
- \( x \): the number of chickens consumed by one 令 (official).
- \( y \): the number of chickens consumed by one 吏 (clerk).
- \( z \): the number of chickens consumed by one 從者 (attendant).

The problem gives us three equations based on the total number of chickens consumed by groups of people:

1. \( 1x + 5y + 10z = 10 \)  (1令, 5吏, 10從者 consume 10 chickens)
2. \( 10x + 1y + 5z = 8 \)  (10令, 1吏, 5從者 consume 8 chickens)
3. \( 5x + 10y + 1z = 6 \)  (5令, 10吏, 1從者 consume 6 chickens)

We solve this system of equations to find \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \).

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the coefficients of the equations
# Equation 1: x + 5y + 10z = 10
# Equation 2: 10x + y + 5z = 8
# Equation 3: 5x + 10y + z = 6

# Coefficients matrix
A = [
    [1, 5, 10],
    [10, 1, 5],
    [5, 10, 1]
]

# Constants on the right-hand side
B = [10, 8, 6]

# Solve using substitution or elimination
# Step 1: Eliminate one variable (z) from two equations
# Multiply and subtract equations to isolate variables

# First, eliminate z from equations 1 and 2
# Multiply equation 1 by 5 and equation 2 by 10, then subtract:
# 5(x + 5y + 10z) - 10(10x + y + 5z) = 5(10) - 10(8)
# 5x + 25y + 50z - 100x - 10y - 50z = 50 - 80
# -95x + 15y = -30  --> Simplify to:
eq4_x_y = [-95, 15, -30]  # -95x + 15y = -30

# Next, eliminate z from equations 1 and 3
# Multiply equation 1 by 1 and equation 3 by 10, then subtract:
# 1(x + 5y + 10z) - 10(5x + 10y + z) = 1(10) - 10(6)
# x + 5y + 10z - 50x - 100y - 10z = 10 - 60
# -49x - 95y = -50  --> Simplify to:
eq5_x_y = [-49, -95, -50]  # -49x - 95y = -50

# Step 2: Solve the two-variable system (eq4_x_y and eq5_x_y)
# Use elimination to solve for x and y
# Multiply eq4_x_y by 49 and eq5_x_y by 95, then subtract:
# 49(-95x + 15y) - 95(-49x - 95y) = 49(-30) - 95(-50)
# -4655x + 735y + 4655x + 9025y = -1470 + 4750
# 9760y = 3280  --> Simplify to:
y = Fraction(3280, 9760)  # y = 1/3

# Substitute y = 1/3 into eq4_x_y to solve for x:
# -95x + 15(1/3) = -30
# -95x + 5 = -30
# -95x = -35
x = Fraction(-35, -95)  # x = 7/19

# Substitute x = 7/19 and y = 1/3 into equation 1 to solve for z:
# x + 5y + 10z = 10
# (7/19) + 5(1/3) + 10z = 10
# (7/19) + (5/3) + 10z = 10
# Find a common denominator and solve for z:
z = Fraction(10) - Fraction
