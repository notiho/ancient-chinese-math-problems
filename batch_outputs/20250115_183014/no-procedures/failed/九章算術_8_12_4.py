今有五家共井，甲二綆不足，如乙一綆；乙三綆不足，如丙一綆；丙四綆不足，如丁一綆；丁五綆不足，如戊一綆；戊六綆不足，如甲一綆。如各得所不足一綆，皆逮。問︰井深、綆長各幾何？
荅曰：井深 a丈 。甲綆長 b丈 ，乙綆長 c丈 ，丙綆長 d丈 ，丁綆長 e丈 ，戊綆長 f尺 。

This is a classic ancient Chinese math problem involving a shared well and the lengths of ropes (綆) used by five families. The problem is to determine the depth of the well and the length of each family's rope.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. Let the depth of the well be `a` (in 丈).
2. Let the rope lengths of the five families (甲, 乙, 丙, 丁, 戊) be `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` (in 丈).
3. The relationships are given as:
   - 甲's rope is 2 丈 shorter than 乙's rope: `b + 2 = c`
   - 乙's rope is 3 丈 shorter than 丙's rope: `c + 3 = d`
   - 丙's rope is 4 丈 shorter than 丁's rope: `d + 4 = e`
   - 丁's rope is 5 丈 shorter than 戊's rope: `e + 5 = f`
   - 戊's rope is 6 丈 shorter than 甲's rope: `f + 6 = b`
4. Each family’s rope, when extended by the amount they are "short," reaches the bottom of the well. Thus, the depth of the well `a` is equal to the length of each family's rope plus their respective "shortfall."

### Solution in Python:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Let the depth of the well be 'a' (in 丈)
# Let the rope lengths of 甲, 乙, 丙, 丁, 戊 be b, c, d, e, f (in 丈)

# Define the relationships
# b + 2 = c
# c + 3 = d
# d + 4 = e
# e + 5 = f
# f + 6 = b

# Solve the system of equations
# Express all variables in terms of b
c = b + 2
d = c + 3  # b + 2 + 3 = b + 5
e = d + 4  # b + 5 + 4 = b + 9
f = e + 5  # b + 9 + 5 = b + 14

# f + 6 = b
# Substitute f = b + 14 into f + 6 = b
b + 14 + 6 = b
20 = 0  # Contradictory
