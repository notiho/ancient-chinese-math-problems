This is a complex ancient Chinese math problem involving the calculation of the volume of an irregular trench and determining the number of workers required to complete the task. Let's break it down step by step and solve it.

---

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Trench Dimensions**:
   - Top width: 1丈6尺3寸 = 16尺3寸
   - Bottom width: 1丈 = 10尺
   - Depth: 6尺3寸
   - Length: 13丈2尺1寸 = 132尺1寸

2. **Volume Calculation**:
   The trench is trapezoidal in cross-section. The formula for the volume of a trapezoidal prism is:
   \[
   V = \frac{(上廣 + 下廣)}{2} \times 深 \times 袤
   \]

3. **Worker Effort**:
   - A worker can dig **871尺** of earth.
   - Additional effort for removing soil: **1/5** of the digging effort.
   - Additional effort for dealing with sand, gravel, water, and stones: **more than half** of the digging effort (specifically **太半**, which is interpreted as **3/5**).
   - Total effort per worker is adjusted accordingly.

4. **Determine the Number of Workers**:
   Divide the total effort required by the adjusted effort per worker to find the number of workers.

### Python Code Solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Trench dimensions
top_width = Fraction(16, 1) + Fraction(3, 10)  # 16尺3寸
bottom_width = Fraction(10, 1)  # 10尺
depth = Fraction(6, 1) + Fraction(3, 10)  # 6尺3寸
length = Fraction(132, 1) + Fraction(1, 10)  # 132尺1寸

# Volume calculation (in cubic chi)
volume = ((top_width + bottom_width) / 2) * depth * length

# Worker effort
worker_effort = Fraction(871, 1)  # 871 cubic chi per worker
soil_removal_effort = worker_effort * Fraction(1, 5)  # 1/5 of digging effort
sand_gravel_effort = worker_effort * Fraction(3, 5)  # 3/5 of digging effort
total_effort_per_worker = worker_effort + soil_removal_effort + sand_gravel_effort

# Total workers required
workers = volume / total_effort_per_worker

# Convert to mixed number for better readability
workers_whole = workers.numerator // workers.denominator
workers_fraction = Fraction(workers.numerator % workers.denominator, workers.denominator)

# Output results
print(f"Trench volume: {volume} cubic chi")
print(f"Total effort per worker: {total_effort_per_worker} cubic chi")
print(f"Number of workers required: {workers_whole}人 and {workers_fraction}人")

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Trench Dimensions**:
   - All dimensions are converted into fractions to handle the mixed units of chi and cun (1 chi = 10 cun).

2. **Volume Calculation**:
   - The trapezoidal prism formula is used to calculate the volume in cubic chi.

3. **Worker Effort**:
   - The effort per worker is adjusted by adding the additional efforts for soil removal and dealing with sand/gravel.

4. **Number of Workers**:
   - The total volume is divided by the adjusted effort per worker to determine the number of workers required.

---

### Final Answer:

After running the code, the output will provide the trench volume and the number of workers required in both whole numbers and fractional parts. For this specific problem:

- Trench volume: **10,943.8 cubic chi** (matches the given answer in the problem).
- Number of workers required: **a人** (calculated by the code).
