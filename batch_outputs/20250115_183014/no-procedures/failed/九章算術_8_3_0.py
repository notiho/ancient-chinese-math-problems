今有上禾五秉，損實一斗一升，當下禾七秉。上禾七秉，損實二斗五升，當下禾五秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
荅曰：上禾 a秉 b升 ，下禾 c秉 d升 。

"""
Suppose there are two types of grain, "upper grain" (上禾) and "lower grain" (下禾). 
The problem provides the following relationships:

1. Five bundles of upper grain (5秉) lose 1斗1升 of grain when converted to lower grain, which is equivalent to seven bundles of lower grain (7秉).
2. Seven bundles of upper grain (7秉) lose 2斗5升 of grain when converted to lower grain, which is equivalent to five bundles of lower grain (5秉).

Question: How much grain does one bundle of upper grain and one bundle of lower grain yield?

Answer: One bundle of upper grain yields *a*斗 *b*升, and one bundle of lower grain yields *c*斗 *d*升.

# First relationship: 5 bundles of upper grain lose 1斗1升, equivalent to 7 bundles of lower grain
upper_loss_1 = 1 * 斗_to_升 + 1  # Convert 1斗1升 to total 升
upper_1 = 5  # 5 bundles of upper grain
lower_1 = 7  # 7 bundles of lower grain

# Second relationship: 7 bundles of upper grain lose 2斗5升, equivalent to 5 bundles of lower grain
upper_loss_2 = 2 * 斗_to_升 + 5  # Convert 2斗5升 to total 升
upper_2 = 7  # 7 bundles of upper grain
lower_2 = 5  # 5 bundles of lower grain

# Let x = grain per bundle of upper grain (in 升)
# Let y = grain per bundle of lower grain (in 升)

# Set up the equations based on the problem:
# Equation 1: 5x - 7y = 1斗1升 = upper_loss_1
# Equation 2: 7x - 5y = 2斗5升 = upper_loss_2

# Solve for x and y
# Multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 5 to eliminate y
eq1 = 5 * upper_1 - 7 * lower_1  # 5x - 7y = upper_loss_1
eq2 = 7 * upper_2 - 5 * lower_2  # 7x - 5y = upper_loss_2

# Solve for x (grain per bundle of upper grain)
x = Fraction(upper_loss_1 * 7 - upper_loss_2 * 5, 5 * 7 - 7 * 5)

# Solve for y (grain per bundle of lower grain)
y = Fraction(5 * upper_loss_1 - 5 * x, 7)

# Convert x and y back to 斗 and 升
a = x // 斗_to_升  # Number of 斗 in x
b = x % 斗_to_升  # Remaining 升 in x

c = y // 斗_to_升  # Number of 斗 in y
d = y % 斗_to_升  # Remaining 升 in y

# Final results
a, b, c, d
