Suppose there are 7 dou and 9 sheng of millet. It is desired to turn it into polished rice.
Question: how much polished rice does one obtain?

Answer: it makes *a* dou of polished rice.

# 粟七斗九升
粟斗 = 7
粟升 = 9

# Convert everything to sheng (1 dou = 10 sheng)
total_sheng = 粟斗 * 10 + 粟升

# To convert millet to polished rice, multiply by 2/3
polished_rice_sheng = Fraction(2, 3) * total_sheng

# Convert back to dou and sheng
a斗 = polished_rice_sheng // 10  # Whole dou
a升 = polished_rice_sheng % 10   # Remaining sheng

# Final result
a = Fraction(polished_rice_sheng, 10)  # Represent as dou
