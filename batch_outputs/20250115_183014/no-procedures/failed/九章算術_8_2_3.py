今有上禾二秉，中禾三秉，下禾四秉，實皆不滿斗。上取中，中取下，下取上各一秉而實滿斗。問︰上、中、下禾實一秉各幾何？
荅曰：上禾 a秉 實 b斗 ，中禾 c秉 實 d斗 ，下禾 e秉 實 f斗 。

Suppose there are three types of grain: upper grain (2 bundles), middle grain (3 bundles), and lower grain (4 bundles). None of them individually fills a dou. 
If one bundle is taken from the middle grain and added to the upper grain, one bundle is taken from the lower grain and added to the middle grain, and one bundle is taken from the upper grain and added to the lower grain, then each type of grain becomes exactly 1 dou.

Question: How much does each bundle of upper, middle, and lower grain weigh in dou?

Answer: Upper grain has *a* bundles, each weighing *b* dou. Middle grain has *c* bundles, each weighing *d* dou. Lower grain has *e* bundles, each weighing *f* dou.

上禾_秉 = 2
中禾_秉 = 3
下禾_秉 = 4

# Let the weight of one bundle of upper grain, middle grain, and lower grain be x, y, and z respectively
# When 1 bundle is exchanged as described, the total weight for each type becomes 1 dou:
# 2x + y = 1
# 3y + z = 1
# 4z + x = 1

# Solve the system of equations:
# From the first equation: y = 1 - 2x
# Substitute y into the second equation: 3(1 - 2x) + z = 1
# Simplify: 3 - 6x + z = 1 -> z = 6x - 2
# Substitute z into the third equation: 4(6x - 2) + x = 1
# Simplify: 24x - 8 + x = 1 -> 25x = 9 -> x = 9/25

# Now calculate y and z:
x = Fraction(9, 25)  # Weight of one bundle of upper grain
y = 1 - 2 * x        # Weight of one bundle of middle grain
z = 6 * x - 2        # Weight of one bundle of lower grain

# Calculate the total weight for each type of grain
a, b = 上禾_秉, x
c, d = 中禾_秉, y

# Results
a, b, c, d, e, f  # Upper grain: a bundles, each b dou; Middle grain: c bundles, each d dou; Lower grain: e bundles, each f dou.
