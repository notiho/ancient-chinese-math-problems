今有上禾七秉，損實一斗，益之下禾二秉，而實一十斗。下禾八秉，益實一斗與上禾二秉，而實一十斗。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
荅曰：上禾 a秉 實 b斗 ，下禾 c秉 實 d斗 。

This is a classic system of equations problem. Let's break it down step by step and solve it using Python.

### Problem Breakdown:
- **Given:**
  - 7 bundles of upper millet lose 1 dou of grain, but adding 2 bundles of lower millet results in 10 dou.
  - 8 bundles of lower millet gain 1 dou of grain, but adding 2 bundles of upper millet results in 10 dou.

- **Unknowns:**
  - The grain yield per bundle of upper millet (let's call it `a` dou per bundle).
  - The grain yield per bundle of lower millet (let's call it `b` dou per bundle).

- **Equations:**
  1. \( 7a - 1 + 2b = 10 \)
  2. \( 8b + 1 + 2a = 10 \)

We solve these equations to find `a` (grain yield per bundle of upper millet) and `b` (grain yield per bundle of lower millet).

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Equation 1: 7a - 1 + 2b = 10
# Simplify: 7a + 2b = 11
# Equation 2: 8b + 1 + 2a = 10
# Simplify: 2a + 8b = 9

# Solve the system of equations
# Multiply Equation 1 by 4 to align coefficients of `a`:
# 28a + 8b = 44
# Subtract Equation 2: (28a + 8b) - (2a + 8b) = 44 - 9
# 26a = 35
a = Fraction(35, 26)

# Substitute `a` into Equation 1 to solve for `b`:
# 7a + 2b = 11
# 2b = 11 - 7a
# b = (11 - 7a) / 2
b = Fraction(11 - 7 * a, 2)

# Results
print(f"Upper millet yield per bundle (a): {a} dou")
print(f"Lower millet yield per bundle (b): {b} dou")


"""


---

### Explanation of Results:
- `a` represents the grain yield per bundle of upper millet.
- `b` represents the grain yield per bundle of lower millet.

When you run the code, you'll get the exact fractional values for `a` and `b`.
