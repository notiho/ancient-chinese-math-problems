This is a classic ancient Chinese problem involving a frustum-shaped granary. Let's break it down step by step and solve it using Python.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The granary is shaped like a frustum of a square pyramid.
2. The difference between the lengths of the sides of the top square and the bottom square is 6 chi.
3. The height of the granary is 9 chi more than the side length of the top square.
4. The granary can hold 187 shi and 2 dou of grain.
5. 50 shi and 4 dou of grain have been removed, and we need to calculate the remaining depth of the grain.

### Units:
- 1 shi = 10 dou
- 1 dou = 10 sheng
- Volume formula for a frustum:  
  \( V = \frac{h}{3} \times (a^2 + ab + b^2) \),  
  where \( h \) is the height, \( a \) is the side length of the top square, and \( b \) is the side length of the bottom square.

### Questions:
1. Find the side length of the top square (\( a \)).
2. Find the side length of the bottom square (\( b \)).
3. Find the height of the granary (\( c \)).
4. Find the remaining depth of the grain and the side length of the top square (\( d \)).

### Python Code Solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total volume of the granary in shi
total_volume_shi = 187 + Fraction(2, 10)  # 187 shi and 2 dou
total_volume_dou = total_volume_shi * 10  # Convert to dou

# Grain removed in dou
removed_volume_shi = 50 + Fraction(4, 10)  # 50 shi and 4 dou
removed_volume_dou = removed_volume_shi * 10  # Convert to dou

# Remaining grain volume in dou
remaining_volume_dou = total_volume_dou - removed_volume_dou

# Let the side length of the top square be 'a' chi
# Let the side length of the bottom square be 'b' chi
# Let the height of the granary be 'c' chi
# From the problem, we know:
# b = a + 6
# c = a + 9

# Volume formula for the frustum:
# V = (c / 3) * (a^2 + a*b + b^2)
# Substitute b = a + 6 and c = a + 9 into the formula:
# V = ((a + 9) / 3) * (a^2 + a*(a + 6) + (a + 6)^2)

# Simplify the formula:
# V = ((a + 9) / 3) * (a^2 + a^2 + 6a + a^2 + 12a + 36)
# V = ((a + 9) / 3) * (3a^2 + 18a + 36)
# V = (a + 9) * (a^2 + 6a + 12)

# Set the total volume equal to the given volume (in dou):
# (a + 9) * (a^2 + 6a + 12) = total_volume_dou

# Solve for 'a' (side length of the top square):
for a in range(1, 100):  # Test integer values for 'a'
    b = a + 6
    c = a + 9
    volume = (c / 3) * (a**2 + a * b + b**2)
    if volume == total_volume_dou:
        top_side = a
        bottom_side = b
        height = c
        break

# Remaining depth of the grain:
# Use the same formula but solve for the height of the remaining grain
remaining_depth = 0
for h in range(1, 100):  # Test integer values for remaining depth
    volume = (h / 3) * (top_side**2 + top_side * bottom_side + bottom_side**2)
    if volume == remaining_volume_dou:
        remaining_depth = h
        break

# Output the results
print(f"Top side length (a): {top_side} chi")
print(f"Bottom side length (b): {bottom_side} chi")
print(f"Height of the granary (c): {height} chi")
print(f"Remaining depth of the grain (d): {remaining_depth} chi")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. The formula for the volume of a frustum is used to calculate the total volume of the granary.
2. The side lengths of the top and bottom squares, as well as the height, are determined by substituting the given relationships.
3. The remaining depth of the grain is calculated by solving the volume formula for the remaining grain volume.

### Final Answer:
- Top side length (\( a \)): **calculated value** chi
- Bottom side length (\( b \)): **calculated value** chi
- Height of the granary (\( c \)): **calculated value** chi
- Remaining depth of the grain (\( d \)): **calculated value** chi
