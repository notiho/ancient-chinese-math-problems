This problem involves a trade and mixture of lacquer (漆) and oil (油). Let's break it down step by step and solve it.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Ratios**:
   - 3 dou of lacquer (漆) can be exchanged for 4 dou of oil (油).
   - 4 dou of oil can be mixed with 5 dou of lacquer.

2. **Task**:
   - Start with 3 dou of lacquer.
   - Exchange some lacquer for oil.
   - Mix the obtained oil with the remaining lacquer.
   - Determine:
     - How much lacquer is used for the exchange (出漆 `a` dou).
     - How much oil is obtained (得油 `b` dou).
     - How much lacquer remains and is mixed with the oil (和漆 `c` dou and `d` sheng).

---

### Solution in Python:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Initial lacquer
initial_lacquer = 3  # in dou

# Exchange ratio: 3 dou of lacquer -> 4 dou of oil
lacquer_for_exchange = 3  # All lacquer is used for exchange
oil_obtained = Fraction(4, 3) * lacquer_for_exchange  # 4/3 dou of oil per 1 dou of lacquer

# Mixing ratio: 4 dou of oil -> 5 dou of lacquer
# We mix all the obtained oil with lacquer in the same ratio
lacquer_for_mixing = Fraction(5, 4) * oil_obtained  # 5/4 dou of lacquer per 1 dou of oil

# Remaining lacquer after exchange
remaining_lacquer = initial_lacquer - lacquer_for_exchange

# Total lacquer used for mixing
total_lacquer_mixed = lacquer_for_mixing + remaining_lacquer

# Convert total lacquer mixed into dou and sheng (1 dou = 10 sheng)
c_dou = int(total_lacquer_mixed)  # Whole dou
c_sheng = (total_lacquer_mixed - c_dou) * 10  # Remaining sheng

# Results
a = lacquer_for_exchange  # Lacquer used for exchange
b = oil_obtained  # Oil obtained
c = c_dou  # Whole dou of lacquer mixed
d = c_sheng  # Sheng of lacquer mixed

# Output results
a, b, c, d


"""

### Explanation of Results:
- `a`: The amount of lacquer used for the exchange.
- `b`: The amount of oil obtained from the exchange.
- `c`: The whole dou of lacquer mixed with the oil.
- `d`: The remaining sheng of lacquer mixed with the oil.

This Python code calculates the exact values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` based on the given ratios and initial conditions.
