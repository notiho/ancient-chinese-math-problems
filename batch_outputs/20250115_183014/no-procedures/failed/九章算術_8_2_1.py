今有上禾二秉，中禾三秉，下禾四秉，實皆不滿斗。上取中，中取下，下取上各一秉而實滿斗。問︰上、中、下禾實一秉各幾何？
荅曰：上禾 a秉 實 b斗 ，中禾 c秉 實 d斗 ，下禾 e秉 實 f斗 。

Suppose there are three types of grain: upper grain (2 bundles), middle grain (3 bundles), and lower grain (4 bundles). None of them are full dou in volume. 
When one bundle is taken from the middle grain and added to the upper grain, one bundle is taken from the lower grain and added to the middle grain, and one bundle is taken from the upper grain and added to the lower grain, each type of grain becomes exactly 1 dou in volume.

Question: How much volume does one bundle of each type of grain contain?

Answer: Upper grain has *a* bundles, each bundle is *b* dou; middle grain has *c* bundles, each bundle is *d* dou; lower grain has *e* bundles, each bundle is *f* dou.

# Let the volume of one bundle of upper, middle, and lower grain be x, y, and z respectively
# When redistributed:
# 1. 上禾 + 中禾 = 1斗 => 2x + y = 1
# 2. 中禾 + 下禾 = 1斗 => 3y + z = 1
# 3. 下禾 + 上禾 = 1斗 => 4z + x = 1

# Solve the system of equations manually:
# From equation (1): y = 1 - 2x
# Substitute y into equation (2): 3(1 - 2x) + z = 1
# Simplify: 3 - 6x + z = 1 => z = 6x - 2
# Substitute z into equation (3): 4(6x - 2) + x = 1
# Simplify: 24x - 8 + x = 1 => 25x = 9 => x = 9/25
# Substitute x into y: y = 1 - 2(9/25) = 1 - 18/25 = 7/25
# Substitute x into z: z = 6(9/25) - 2 = 54/25 - 50/25 = 4/25

# Results:
a, b = 上禾_秉, Fraction(9, 25)  # Upper grain: 2 bundles, each 9/25 dou
