今有令一人、吏五人、從者一十人，食雞一十；令一十人、吏一人、從者五人，食雞八；令五人、吏一十人、從者一人，食雞六。問︰令、吏、從者食雞各幾何？

This is a classic system of linear equations problem. Let's solve it step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
We are given:
1. One "令" (official), five "吏" (clerks), and ten "從者" (attendants) eat 10 chickens.
2. Ten "令", one "吏", and five "從者" eat 8 chickens.
3. Five "令", ten "吏", and one "從者" eat 6 chickens.

We need to find how many chickens each "令", "吏", and "從者" eats individually.

Let:
- \( x \) = number of chickens eaten by one "令".
- \( y \) = number of chickens eaten by one "吏".
- \( z \) = number of chickens eaten by one "從者".

The equations are:
1. \( 1x + 5y + 10z = 10 \)
2. \( 10x + 1y + 5z = 8 \)
3. \( 5x + 10y + 1z = 6 \)

We solve this system of equations.

# Coefficients of the equations
# Equation 1: x + 5y + 10z = 10
# Equation 2: 10x + y + 5z = 8
# Equation 3: 5x + 10y + z = 6

# Step 1: Solve for x, y, z using substitution or elimination
# Using elimination, we simplify the equations step by step.

# Multiply Equation 1 by 10 to eliminate x from Equation 2 and Equation 3
# 10x + 50y + 100z = 100  (Modified Equation 1)
# 10x + 1y + 5z = 8       (Equation 2)
# 5x + 10y + 1z = 6       (Equation 3)

# Subtract Equation 2 from Modified Equation 1
# (10x + 50y + 100z) - (10x + 1y + 5z) = 100 - 8
# 49y + 95z = 92  (New Equation A)

# Multiply Equation 1 by 5 to eliminate x from Equation 3
# 5x + 25y + 50z = 50  (Modified Equation 1)
# 5x + 10y + 1z = 6    (Equation 3)

# Subtract Equation 3 from Modified Equation 1
# (5x + 25y + 50z) - (5x + 10y + 1z) = 50 - 6
# 15y + 49z = 44  (New Equation B)

# Step 2: Solve the two-variable system (Equation A and Equation B)
# Equation A: 49y + 95z = 92
# Equation B: 15y + 49z = 44

# Multiply Equation B by 49 and Equation A by 15 to align coefficients of y
# 49 * (15y + 49z) = 49 * 44
# 15 * (49y + 95z) = 15 * 92

# 735y + 2401z = 2156  (Modified Equation B)
# 735y + 1425z = 1380  (Modified Equation A)

# Subtract Modified Equation A from Modified Equation B
# (735y + 2401z) - (735y + 1425z) = 2156 - 1380
# 976z = 776
# z = 776 / 976 = Fraction(194, 244) = Fraction(97, 122)

# Substitute z = 97/122 into Equation B
# 15y + 49(97/122) = 44
# 15y + 4753/122 = 44
# 15y = 44 - 4753/122
# 15y = (5376 - 4753) / 122
# 15y = 623 / 122
# y = (623 / 122) / 15 = 623 / (122 * 15) = Fraction(623, 1830) = Fraction(311, 915)

# Substitute y = 311/915 and z = 97/122 into Equation 1
# x + 5(311/915) + 10(97/122) = 10
# x + 1555/915 + 970/122 = 10
# x + Fraction(311, 183) + Fraction(485, 61) = 10
# x = 10 - Fraction(311, 183) - Fraction(485, 61)
# x = Fraction(1830, 183) - Fraction(311, 183) - Fraction(1455, 183)
# x = Fraction(1830 - 311 - 1455, 183)
# x = Fraction(64, 183)

# Final Results:
令_a人_食_b雞 = Fraction(64, 183)
吏_c人_食_d雞 = Fraction(311, 915)
從者_e人_食_f雞 = Fraction(97, 122)

# Output results
令_a人_食_b雞, 吏_c人_食_d雞, 從者_e人_食_f雞
