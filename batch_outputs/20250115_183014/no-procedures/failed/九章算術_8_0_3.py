"""
This problem involves solving a system of linear equations to determine how much grain (in dou) is produced by one bundle (秉) of upper (上禾), middle (中禾), and lower (下禾) grain.

The equations are derived from the problem statement:

1. \( 3x + 2y + 1z = 39 \)
2. \( 2x + 3y + 1z = 34 \)
3. \( 1x + 2y + 3z = 26 \)

Where:
- \( x \) is the amount of grain produced by one bundle of upper grain (上禾),
- \( y \) is the amount of grain produced by one bundle of middle grain (中禾),
- \( z \) is the amount of grain produced by one bundle of lower grain (下禾).

We will solve this system of equations step by step.

# Define the equations

eq1_b = b1 - b2  # Coefficient of y
eq1_d = d1 - d2  # Constant term
# Result: x - y = 5

# Eliminate z from the second and third equations
eq2_a = a2 - a3  # Coefficient of x
eq2_b = b2 - b3  # Coefficient of y
eq2_d = d2 - d3  # Constant term
# Result: x + y = 8

# Step 2: Solve for x and y using the two new equations
# x - y = 5
# x + y = 8

# Add the two equations to eliminate y
x = Fraction((eq1_d + eq2_d), (eq1_a + eq2_a))  # x = 6

# Substitute x back into one of the equations to solve for y
y = Fraction((eq2_d - eq2_a * x), eq2_b)  # y = 2

# Step 3: Solve for z using one of the original equations
# Use 3x + 2y + z = 39
z = Fraction((d1 - a1 * x - b1 * y), c1)  # z = 7

# Final results
a = x  # Upper grain (上禾) per bundle
b = y  # Middle grain (中禾) per bundle
c = z  # Lower grain (下禾) per bundle

### Explanation of the Solution:

1. We first eliminate \( z \) from the first two equations and the second and third equations to reduce the system to two equations with two variables (\( x \) and \( y \)).
2. We solve the reduced system of equations to find \( x \) and \( y \).
3. Finally, we substitute \( x \) and \( y \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( z \).

### Final Answer:
- 上禾一秉得 \( a = 6 \) 斗,
- 中禾一秉得 \( b = 2 \) 斗,
- 下禾一秉得 \( c = 7 \) 斗.
