This problem involves solving a system of linear equations to determine the price of one dou of each type of grain. Let the prices of one dou of 麻 (hemp), 麥 (wheat), 菽 (beans), 答 (rice), and 黍 (millet) be \(a\), \(c\), \(e\), \(g\), and \(i\) respectively. The equations are derived from the given quantities and their total prices.

The equations are as follows:

1. \(9a + 7c + 3e + 2g + 5i = 140\)
2. \(7a + 6c + 4e + 5g + 3i = 128\)
3. \(3a + 5c + 7e + 6g + 4i = 116\)
4. \(2a + 5c + 3e + 9g + 4i = 112\)
5. \(1a + 3c + 2e + 8g + 5i = 95\)

We will solve this system of equations step by step using substitution and elimination.

Here is the Python code to solve it:

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input the equations**: Each equation is represented as a list of coefficients, with the last element being the total price.
2. **Gaussian elimination**: This method systematically eliminates variables to solve the system of linear equations.
3. **Fraction handling**: The `Fraction` class ensures that all calculations are done exactly without floating-point errors.
4. **Output the solution**: The solution gives the price of one dou of each grain in terms of qian (錢).

### Expected Output:
The output will be the price of one dou of 麻, 麥, 菽, 答, and 黍 in terms of qian (錢).
