今有七百三十八户，共請絲二十七斤五两。問：户得㡬何？
答曰： a銖 b 絫 c黍 奇 d銖 e黍 。

To solve this problem, we need to distribute 27 jin and 5 liang of silk among 738 households. The result will be expressed in traditional Chinese units: **銖 (zhu)**, **絫 (lian)**, and **黍 (shu)**.

---

### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Convert the total silk into smaller units:**
   - 1 **jin** = 16 **liang**
   - 1 **liang** = 24 **zhu**
   - 1 **zhu** = 10 **shu**

   So, the total silk in **shu** is:
   \[
   \text{Total silk in shu} = (27 \times 16 \times 24 \times 10) + (5 \times 24 \times 10)
   \]

2. **Divide the total silk among 738 households:**
   - Each household gets:
   \[
   \text{Silk per household in shu} = \frac{\text{Total silk in shu}}{738}
   \]

3. **Convert the result back into traditional units:**
   - Start with **shu** and convert to **zhu**, **liang**, and so on:
     - 10 **shu** = 1 **zhu**
     - 24 **zhu** = 1 **liang**
     - 16 **liang** = 1 **jin**

---

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total silk in jin and liang
total_jin = 27
total_liang = 5

# Convert total silk into shu
shu_per_jin = 16 * 24 * 10
shu_per_liang = 24 * 10
total_shu = (total_jin * shu_per_jin) + (total_liang * shu_per_liang)

# Number of households
households = 738

# Silk per household in shu
silk_per_household = Fraction(total_shu, households)

# Convert back to traditional units
shu = silk_per_household % 10
zhu = (silk_per_household // 10) % 24
liang = (silk_per_household // (10 * 24)) % 16
jin = silk_per_household // (10 * 24 * 16)

# Output the result
a = jin
b = liang
c = zhu
d = shu.numerator  # Remaining shu
print(f"Each household gets: {a} jin, {b} liang, {c} zhu, and {d} shu.")


"""


---

### Explanation of the Output:
- **a**: Number of **jin** each household gets.
- **b**: Number of **liang** each household gets.
- **c**: Number of **zhu** each household gets.
- **d**: Remaining **shu** each household gets.

This ensures the silk is distributed fairly among all households using traditional Chinese units.
