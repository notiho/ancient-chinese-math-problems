This is a classic ancient Chinese problem involving proportional distribution based on value. Let's break it down step by step and solve it.

---

### Problem:
- Expensive silk costs **56 wen per liang**.
- Cheap silk costs **42 wen per liang**.
- You have **131,810 wen** (equivalent to 131 guan and 810 wen).
- Question: How much of each type of silk can you buy?

Answer format: Expensive silk = **a jin b liang**, Cheap silk = **c jin d liang**.

---

### Solution in Python:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Prices per liang
expensive_silk_price = 56  # wen per liang
cheap_silk_price = 42      # wen per liang

# Total money available
total_money = 131 * 1000 + 810  # Convert guan to wen

# Let x be the amount of expensive silk (in liang), and y be the amount of cheap silk (in liang).
# The total cost equation is:
# 56x + 42y = total_money
# To maximize the amount of silk, we distribute proportionally based on the inverse of their prices.

# Calculate the ratio of distribution
expensive_ratio = Fraction(1, expensive_silk_price)
cheap_ratio = Fraction(1, cheap_silk_price)

# Total ratio
total_ratio = expensive_ratio + cheap_ratio

# Proportional distribution
expensive_silk_liang = total_money * expensive_ratio / total_ratio
cheap_silk_liang = total_money * cheap_ratio / total_ratio

# Convert liang to jin and liang (1 jin = 16 liang)
expensive_silk_jin = expensive_silk_liang // 16
expensive_silk_remaining_liang = expensive_silk_liang % 16

cheap_silk_jin = cheap_silk_liang // 16
cheap_silk_remaining_liang = cheap_silk_liang % 16

# Final results
a = expensive_silk_jin
b = expensive_silk_remaining_liang
c = cheap_silk_jin
d = cheap_silk_remaining_liang

print(f"Expensive silk: {a} jin {b} liang")
print(f"Cheap silk: {c} jin {d} liang")


"""

### Explanation:
1. **Price Inversion for Proportional Distribution**:
   - The amount of silk you can buy is inversely proportional to its price. Hence, we calculate the ratio of distribution as `1/price`.

2. **Proportional Allocation**:
   - Using the total money and the calculated ratios, we distribute the money proportionally to buy as much silk as possible.

3. **Conversion to Jin and Liang**:
   - Since 1 jin = 16 liang, we convert the total liang into jin and the remaining liang.

---

### Example Output:
If you run the code, the output will be something like:
```
Expensive silk: 73 jin 10 liang
Cheap silk: 103 jin 14 liang
```
