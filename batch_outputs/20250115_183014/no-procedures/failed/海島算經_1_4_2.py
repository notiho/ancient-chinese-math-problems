今有登山望樓，樓在平地。偃矩山上，令句高六尺。從句端斜望樓足，入下股一丈二尺。又設重矩于上，令其間相去三丈。更從句端斜望樓足，入上股一丈一尺四寸。又立小表于入股之會，復從句端斜望樓岑端，入小表八寸。問樓高幾何？
答曰： a丈 。

This is a classic ancient Chinese mathematical problem involving geometry and the use of similar triangles to calculate the height of a tower (樓高). Let's break it down step by step and solve it.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given:**
   - A mountain with a height of 6 chi (尺) (the height of the first triangle's vertical leg, or "句").
   - From the top of the mountain, looking down at the base of the tower (樓足), the horizontal distance (下股) is 12 chi (1 丈 2 尺).
   - A second measuring device is placed 3 丈 (30 chi) higher up the mountain.
   - From this new position, the horizontal distance (上股) to the base of the tower is 11 chi 4 cun (1 丈 1 尺 4 寸).
   - A small pole (小表) is placed at the intersection of the horizontal lines, and from the top of the mountain, the horizontal distance to the top of the tower (樓岑端) intersects the small pole at 8 cun.

2. **Goal:**
   - Calculate the height of the tower (樓高).

### Solution:
We will use the principle of similar triangles to calculate the height of the tower.

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
句高 = 6  # Height of the mountain (in chi)
下股 = 12  # Horizontal distance to the base of the tower from the first position (in chi)
上股 = Fraction(114, 10)  # Horizontal distance to the base of the tower from the second position (in chi)
間距 = 30  # Distance between the two measuring points (in chi)
小表 = Fraction(8, 10)  # Height of the small pole (in chi)

# Step 1: Calculate the height of the tower using similar triangles
# Let the height of the tower be "a" (in chi)

# Using the first triangle (from the first position):
# The ratio of the height of the tower to the horizontal distance is proportional to the height of the mountain to the horizontal distance:
# a / 下股 = 句高 / (下股 - 上股)

a =
