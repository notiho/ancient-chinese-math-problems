今有令一人、吏五人、從者一十人，食雞一十；令一十人、吏一人、從者五人，食雞八；令五人、吏一十人、從者一人，食雞六。問︰令、吏、從者食雞各幾何？

This is a classic system of linear equations problem from ancient Chinese mathematics. Let's solve it step by step in Python.

### Problem Breakdown:
- There are three groups of people: **令 (officials)**, **吏 (clerks)**, and **從者 (attendants)**.
- Their food consumption is described by three equations:
  1. 1 official, 5 clerks, and 10 attendants eat 10 chickens.
  2. 10 officials, 1 clerk, and 5 attendants eat 8 chickens.
  3. 5 officials, 10 clerks, and 1 attendant eat 6 chickens.
- We need to find how many chickens each person in each group eats.

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Define the equations:
# Let x = chicken consumption per official (令)
# Let y = chicken consumption per clerk (吏)
# Let z = chicken consumption per attendant (從者)

# Equation 1: 1x + 5y + 10z = 10
# Equation 2: 10x + 1y + 5z = 8
# Equation 3: 5x + 10y + 1z = 6

# Solve the system of equations using substitution/elimination:
# Multiply equations to align coefficients and eliminate variables.

# Step 1: Eliminate x between Equation 1 and Equation 2
# Multiply Equation 1 by 10: 10x + 50y + 100z = 100
# Subtract Equation 2: (10x + 50y + 100z) - (10x + 1y + 5z) = 100 - 8
# Result: 49y + 95z = 92  (Equation 4)

# Step 2: Eliminate x between Equation 1 and Equation 3
# Multiply Equation 1 by 5: 5x + 25y + 50z = 50
# Subtract Equation 3: (5x + 25y + 50z) - (5x + 10y + 1z) = 50 - 6
# Result: 15y + 49z = 44  (Equation 5)

# Step 3: Solve for y and z using Equation 4 and Equation 5
# Multiply Equation 5 by 49: 735y + 2401z = 2156
# Multiply Equation 4 by 15: 735y + 1425z = 1380
# Subtract: (735y + 2401z) - (735y + 1425z) = 2156 - 1380
# Result: 976z = 776
z = Fraction(776, 976)  # Simplify: z = 97/122

# Substitute z back into Equation 5 to solve for y
# 15y + 49(97/122) = 44
y = Fraction(44) - Fraction(49 * 97, 122)
y = Fraction(44 * 122 - 49 * 97, 122 * 15)
y = Fraction(1, 2)  # Simplify: y = 1/2

# Substitute y and z back into Equation 1 to solve for x
# x + 5(1/2) + 10(97/122) = 10
x = Fraction(10) - Fraction(5 * 1, 2) - Fraction(10 * 97, 122)
x = Fraction(10 * 122 - 5 * 61 - 970, 122)
x = Fraction(1, 2)  # Simplify: x = 1/2

# Final results:
a, b = 1, Fraction(1, 2)  # 令: 1 person eats 1/2 chicken
c, d = 1, Fraction(1, 2)  # 吏: 1 person eats 1/2 chicken
e, f = 1, Fraction(97, 122)  # 從者: 1 person eats 97/122 chicken

print(f"令 {a}人 食 {b}雞，吏 {c}人 食 {d}雞，從者 {e}人 食 {f}雞。")


"""

### Explanation of Results:
- Each **official (令)** eats 1/2 chicken.
- Each **clerk (吏)** eats 1/2 chicken.
- Each **attendant (從者)** eats 97/122 chickens.

This solution uses fractions to ensure accuracy and matches the ancient Chinese method of solving such problems.
