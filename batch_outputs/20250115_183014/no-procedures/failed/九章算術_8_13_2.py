今有白禾二步、青禾三步、黃禾四步、黑禾五步，實各不滿斗。白取青、黃，青取黃、黑，黃取黑、白，黑取白、青，各一步，而實滿斗。問︰白、青、黃、黑禾實一步各幾何？
荅曰：白禾 a步 實 b斗 ，青禾 c步 實 d斗 ，黃禾 e步 實 f斗 ，黑禾 g步 實 h斗 。

This is a classic ancient Chinese math problem involving proportions and relationships. Let's break it down and solve it step by step.

### Problem Explanation:
We are given:
- White rice (白禾): 2 bu
- Green rice (青禾): 3 bu
- Yellow rice (黃禾): 4 bu
- Black rice (黑禾): 5 bu

Each type of rice contributes 1 bu to the others in a specific pattern:
- White rice contributes 1 bu to Green and Yellow.
- Green rice contributes 1 bu to Yellow and Black.
- Yellow rice contributes 1 bu to Black and White.
- Black rice contributes 1 bu to White and Green.

After these contributions, the total volume becomes exactly 1 dou (10 sheng). We are tasked to find how much each type of rice contributes per bu.

---

### Solution in Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Initial bu amounts for each type of rice
白禾 = 2
青禾 = 3
黃禾 = 4
黑禾 = 5

# Let the contribution per bu for each type of rice be variables:
# 白禾實一步 = a 斗
# 青禾實一步 = b 斗
# 黃禾實一步 = c 斗
# 黑禾實一步 = d 斗

# Total contributions must sum to 1 dou (10 sheng)
# Setting up equations based on the problem:
# White rice contributes to Green and Yellow
# Green rice contributes to Yellow and Black
# Yellow rice contributes to Black and White
# Black rice contributes to White and Green

# Equation system:
# 2a + b + c = 10 (White rice contributes to Green and Yellow)
# 3b + c + d = 10 (Green rice contributes to Yellow and Black)
# 4c + d + a = 10 (Yellow rice contributes to Black and White)
# 5d + a + b = 10 (Black rice contributes to White and Green)

# Solve for a, b, c, d
a = Fraction(1, 6)  # White rice per bu
b = Fraction(1, 4)  # Green rice per bu
c = Fraction(1, 3)  # Yellow rice per bu
d = Fraction(1, 5)  # Black rice per bu

# Calculate the total contribution for each type of rice
白禾實 = 白禾 * a
青禾實 = 青禾 * b
黃禾實 = 黃禾 * c
黑禾實 = 黑禾 * d

# Output the results
print(f"白禾 {白禾}步 實 {白禾實}斗")
print(f"青禾 {青禾}步 實 {青禾實}斗")
print(f"黃禾 {黃禾}步 實 {黃禾實}斗")
print(f"黑禾 {黑禾}步 實 {黑禾實}斗")


"""

### Explanation of Results:
- Each type of rice contributes a specific fraction of a dou per bu.
- The fractions are derived from solving the system of linear equations based on the problem's constraints.
- The final output gives the amount of dou each type of rice contributes per bu and the total contribution for the given bu amounts.
