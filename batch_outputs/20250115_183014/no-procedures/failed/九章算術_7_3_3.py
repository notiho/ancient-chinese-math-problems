Suppose there are two scenarios for buying a cow:
1. Seven families together contribute 190, but it is not enough by 330.
2. Nine families together contribute 270, but it exceeds by 30.

Question: How many families (a) and what is the price of the cow (b)?

Answer: *a* families, and the price of the cow is *b*.
"""

# Let the price of the cow be b, and the number of families be a.

# Equation 1: 7 families contribute 190, but it's short by 330.
# 7 * b = 190 + 330
eq1 = 7 * b == 190 + 330

# Equation 2: 9 families contribute 270, but it exceeds by 30.
# 9 * b = 270 - 30
eq2 = 9 * b == 270 - 30

# Solve for b (price of the cow)
b = Fraction(190 + 330, 7)

# Solve for a (number of families)
a = Fraction(270 - 30, b)

a, b
