今有上禾三秉，益實六斗，當下禾十秉。下禾五秉，益實一斗，當上禾二秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
荅曰：上禾 a秉 實 b斗 ，下禾 c秉 實 d斗 。

Suppose there are two types of grain: "upper grain" (上禾) and "lower grain" (下禾).

- 3 bundles (秉) of upper grain plus 6 dou of grain are equivalent to 10 bundles of lower grain.
- 5 bundles of lower grain plus 1 dou of grain are equivalent to 2 bundles of upper grain.

Question: How much grain (in dou) does one bundle of upper grain and one bundle of lower grain produce?

Answer: One bundle of upper grain produces *b* dou, and one bundle of lower grain produces *d* dou.

from fractions import Fraction

# Let x represent the amount of grain (in dou) produced by one bundle of upper grain.
# Let y represent the amount of grain (in dou) produced by one bundle of lower grain.

# Equation 1: 3x + 6 = 10y
# Equation 2: 5y + 1 = 2x

# Solve for x and y using substitution.

# From Equation 1: 3x + 6 = 10y
# Rearrange to express x in terms of y:
x = Fraction(10 * y - 6, 3)

# Substitute x into Equation 2: 5y + 1 = 2x
# 5y + 1 = 2 * (10y - 6) / 3
# Multiply through by 3 to eliminate fractions:
3 * (5y + 1) = 2 * (10y - 6)
15y + 3 = 20y - 12
# Simplify:
15y - 20y = -12 - 3
-5y = -15
y = 3

# Substitute y = 3 into x = (10y - 6) / 3:
x = Fraction(10 * 3 - 6, 3)
x = Fraction(24, 3)
x = 8

# Results:
a = 1  # One bundle of upper grain
b = x  # Grain produced by one bundle of upper grain
c = 1  # One bundle of lower grain
d = y  # Grain produced by one bundle of lower grain

# Final answer:
a, b, c, d  # (1, 8, 1, 3)
