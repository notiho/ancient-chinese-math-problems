今有上禾七秉，損實一斗，益之下禾二秉，而實一十斗。下禾八秉，益實一斗與上禾二秉，而實一十斗。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
荅曰：上禾 a秉 實 b斗 ，下禾 c秉 實 d斗 。

"""
Suppose there are two types of grain: upper grain (上禾) and lower grain (下禾).

1. Seven bundles (秉) of upper grain lose 1 dou of grain, but when 2 bundles of lower grain are added, the total becomes 10 dou.
2. Eight bundles of lower grain gain 1 dou of grain, but when 2 bundles of upper grain are added, the total becomes 10 dou.

Question: How much grain does one bundle of upper grain and one bundle of lower grain yield?

Answer: One bundle of upper grain yields *a* dou, and one bundle of lower grain yields *b* dou.
"""

# Let x represent the yield of one bundle of upper grain (上禾), and y represent the yield of one bundle of lower grain (下禾).
# We have the following system of equations based on the problem:

# Equation 1: 7x - 1 + 2y = 10
# Equation 2: 8y + 1 + 2x = 10

# Solve the system of equations step by step.

from fractions import Fraction

# Equation 1: 7x - 1 + 2y = 10
# Simplify: 7x + 2y = 11
# Equation 2: 8y + 1 + 2x = 10
# Simplify: 2x + 8y = 9

# Solve for x and y using substitution or elimination.

# From Equation 1: 7x + 2y = 11
# Solve for x: x = (11 - 2y) / 7

# Substitute x into Equation 2: 2x + 8y = 9
# 2((11 - 2y) / 7) + 8y = 9
# (22 - 4y) / 7 + 8y = 9
# Multiply through by 7 to eliminate the fraction:
# 22 - 4y + 56y = 63
# Combine like terms: 52y = 41
# Solve for y: y = 41 / 52

# Substitute y back into x = (11 - 2y) / 7:
# x = (11 - 2(41 / 52)) / 7
# x = (572 / 52 - 82 / 52) / 7
# x = (490 / 52) / 7
# x = 490 / (52 * 7)
# x = 490 / 364
# x = 245 / 182

# Final results:
a = Fraction(245, 182)  # Yield of one bundle of upper grain (上禾)
b = Fraction(41, 52)    # Yield of one bundle of lower grain (下禾)

# Output the results
a, b
