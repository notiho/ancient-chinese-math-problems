今有漆三得油四，油四和漆五。今有漆三斗，欲令分以易油，還自和餘漆。問︰出漆、得油、和漆各幾何？
荅曰：出漆 a斗 ，得油 b斗 ，和漆 c斗 ， d升 。

This problem involves a barter system where lacquer (漆) and oil (油) are exchanged and then mixed back together. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **漆三得油四**: 3 dou of lacquer can be exchanged for 4 dou of oil.
2. **油四和漆五**: 4 dou of oil can be mixed with 5 dou of lacquer.
3. **漆三斗**: Start with 3 dou of lacquer. Exchange some for oil, then mix the oil back with the remaining lacquer.

We need to calculate:
- How much lacquer is exchanged (出漆, `a` dou),
- How much oil is obtained (得油, `b` dou),
- How much lacquer is left after the exchange and mixed back with the oil (和漆, `c` dou and `d` sheng).

### Solution in Python:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 漆三斗
initial_lacquer = 3  # in dou

# 漆三得油四 (3 dou of lacquer gets 4 dou of oil)
lacquer_to_oil_ratio = Fraction(4, 3)

# 油四和漆五 (4 dou of oil mixes with 5 dou of lacquer)
oil_to_lacquer_mix_ratio = Fraction(5, 4)

# Step 1: Exchange lacquer for oil
# Let `a` be the amount of lacquer exchanged
a = initial_lacquer  # Since we only have 3 dou of lacquer, we exchange all of it.

# Calculate the amount of oil obtained
b = lacquer_to_oil_ratio * a

# Step 2: Mix the oil back with lacquer
# According to the mixing ratio, 4 dou of oil mixes with 5 dou of lacquer.
# We need to calculate how much lacquer is required to mix with `b` dou of oil.

# Calculate the lacquer required for mixing
lacquer_for_mixing = oil_to_lacquer_mix_ratio * b

# Since we exchanged all the lacquer, there is no lacquer left for mixing.
# Therefore, the lacquer used for mixing is equal to the lacquer obtained from the oil.

# Step 3: Convert any remaining lacquer into sheng
remaining_lacquer = initial_lacquer - a  # Remaining lacquer after exchange
c = remaining_lacquer  # in dou
d = 0  # in sheng (no leftover lacquer in this case)

# Output the results
print(f"出漆 a = {a} 斗")
print(f"得油 b = {b} 斗")
print(f"和漆 c = {c} 斗, d = {d} 升")


"""

### Explanation of Results:
1. **出漆 (a)**: The amount of lacquer exchanged for oil.
2. **得油 (b)**: The amount of oil obtained from the exchange.
3. **和漆 (c, d)**: The amount of lacquer left after the exchange, mixed back with the oil. If there is any leftover lacquer less than 1 dou, it is converted into sheng (1 dou = 10 sheng).
