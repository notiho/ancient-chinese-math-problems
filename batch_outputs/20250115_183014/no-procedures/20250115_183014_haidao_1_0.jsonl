The vertical leg (the \"upright\") is 6 chi (\u5c3a) tall.\n2. From the top of the vertical leg, the line of sight to the bottom of the valley intersects the horizontal leg (the \"base\") at a distance of 9 chi 1 cun (9.1 chi).\n3. Another carpenter's square is placed 3 zhang (\u4e08) away horizontally from the first one.\n4. From the top of the second vertical leg, the line of sight to the bottom of the valley intersects the horizontal leg at a distance of 8 chi 5 cun (8.5 chi).\n5. The question asks for the depth of the valley (\u8c37\u6df1), denoted as `a` zhang.\n\n### Solution:\nThis problem involves similar triangles. Using the properties of similar triangles, we can set up equations to solve for the depth of the valley.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Given values\n\u53e5\u9ad8 = 6  # Height of the vertical leg in chi\n\u4e0b\u80a1 = Fraction(91, 10)  # Horizontal distance for the first square (9 chi 1 cun = 9.1 chi)\n\u77e9\u9593 = 30  # Distance between the two carpenter's squares in chi (3 zhang = 30 chi)\n\u4e0a\u80a1 = Fraction(85, 10)  # Horizontal distance for the second square (8 chi 5 cun = 8.5 chi)\n\n# Let the depth of the valley be `a` (in chi)\n# Using similar triangles, we know:\n# Depth of valley = (\u53e5\u9ad8 * \u77e9\u9593) / (\u4e0b\u80a1 - \u4e0a\u80a1)\n\na = (\u53e5\u9ad8 * \u77e9\u9593) / (\u4e0b\u80a1 - \u4e0a\u80a1)\n\n# Convert depth from chi to zhang (1 zhang = 10 chi)\na_in_zhang = a / 10\n\n# Output the result\na_in_zhang\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Formula:\n1. The depth of the valley is proportional to the height of the vertical leg (\u53e5\u9ad8) and the distance between the two carpenter's squares (\u77e9\u9593).\n2. The difference in the horizontal distances (\u4e0b\u80a1 - \u4e0a\u80a1) determines the slope of the line of sight.\n3.
