Loss is treated as gain, and gain is treated as loss.\nWhen the yield loses 1 dou, its actual yield exceeds 10 dou. When the yield gains 1 dou, its actual yield is less than 10 dou.\n\nThe method for solving systems of equations says: Place 3 bundles of upper millet, 2 bundles of middle millet, and 1 bundle of lower millet, with a total yield of 39 dou, on the right side.\nArrange the middle and left millet as on the right side. Multiply the upper millet in the right row by the middle row and divide directly. Multiply again by the next row and divide directly.\nThen, multiply the middle millet in the middle row by the left row and divide directly. For the lower millet in the left row, the upper value is the divisor, and the lower value is the dividend. The dividend is the yield of the lower millet.\nTo find the middle millet, multiply the divisor by the middle row's lower yield and divide by the lower millet's yield. The remainder, divided by the number of bundles of middle millet plus one, is the yield of the middle millet.\nTo find the upper millet, multiply the divisor by the right row's lower yield and divide by the yields of the lower and middle millet. The remainder, divided by the number of bundles of upper millet plus one, is the yield of the upper millet.\nThe yields are all as calculated, and each is 1 dou.\n\nAnswer: The yield of one bundle of upper millet is *a*(=1) bundle, with *b*(=35/26) dou. The yield of one bundle of lower millet is *c*(=1) bundle, with *d*(=41/52) dou.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Define the system of equations:\n# 7a - 1 + 2b = 10\n# 2a + 8b + 1 = 10\n\n# Rewrite the equations:\n# 7a + 2b = 11\n# 2a + 8b = 9\n\n# Coefficients of the equations\nA1, B1, C1 = 7, 2, 11  # 7a + 2b = 11\nA2, B2, C2 = 2, 8, 9   # 2a + 8b = 9\n\n# Eliminate one variable (Gaussian elimination):\n# Multiply the first equation by 8 and the second equation by 2 to align coefficients of b:\nA1, B1, C1 = 7 * 8, 2 * 8, 11 * 8  # 56a + 16b = 88\nA2, B2, C2 = 2 * 2, 8 * 2, 9 * 2   # 4a + 16b = 18\n\n# Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate b:\nA = A1 - A2  # 56a - 4a = 52a\nC = C1 - C2  # 88 - 18 = 70\n\n# Solve for a:\na = Fraction(C, A)  # a = 70 / 52 = 35 / 26\n\n# Substitute a back into one of the original equations to solve for b:\n# Using 7a + 2b = 11:\nb = Fraction(C1 - A1 * a, B1)  # b = (11 - 7 * (35/26)) / 2 = 41 / 52\n\n# Results:\nprint(\"The yield of one bundle of upper millet (a) is:\", a)  # 35/26 dou\nprint(\"The yield of one bundle of lower millet (b) is:\", b)  # 41/52 dou\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1.
