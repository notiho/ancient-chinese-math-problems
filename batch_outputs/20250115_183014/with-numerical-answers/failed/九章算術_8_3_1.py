今有上禾五秉，損實一斗一升，當下禾七秉。上禾七秉，損實二斗五升，當下禾五秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾五秉正，下禾七秉負，損實一斗一升正。次置上禾七秉正，下禾五秉負，損實二斗五升正。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：上禾 a(=1)秉 b(=5)升 ，下禾 c(=1)秉 d(=2)升 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using ancient Chinese methods, specifically the "fangcheng" (方程) method, which is an early form of matrix elimination. Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.

### Problem Description:
We are given two scenarios:
1. 5 bundles of upper millet (上禾) lose 1 dou and 1 sheng of grain when compared to 7 bundles of lower millet (下禾).
2. 7 bundles of upper millet lose 2 dou and 5 sheng of grain when compared to 5 bundles of lower millet.

We are tasked to find how much grain (in dou and sheng) is contained in one bundle of upper millet and one bundle of lower millet.

### Procedure:
The procedure uses the "fangcheng" method to solve the system of equations. The steps are:
1. Represent the problem as a system of linear equations.
2. Use elimination to solve for the unknowns.
3. Convert the results into dou and sheng.

### Equations:
Let `x` be the grain in one bundle of upper millet (上禾), and `y` be the grain in one bundle of lower millet (下禾). The equations are:
1. \( 5x - 7y = 1 \, \text{dou} + 1 \, \text{sheng} = 1 + \frac{1}{10} \, \text{dou} = \frac{11}{10} \, \text{dou} \)
2. \( 7x - 5y = 2 \, \text{dou} + 5 \, \text{sheng} = 2 + \frac{5}{10} \, \text{dou} = \frac{25}{10} \, \text{dou} \)

We solve this system using elimination.

### Python Code:

下禾_dou = 下禾_實.numerator // 下禾_實.denominator  # Integer part (dou)
下禾_sheng = (下禾_實 - 下禾_dou) * 10  # Remaining part in sheng

# Final results

### Explanation of the Code:
1. The problem is translated into a system of linear equations.
2. The elimination method is used to solve for one variable (`y`, the grain in one bundle of lower millet).
3. The value of `y` is substituted back into one of the original equations to solve for `x` (the grain in one bundle of upper millet).
4. The results are converted into dou and sheng for the final answer.

### Final Answer:
- 上禾: 1 dou 5 sheng
- 下禾: 1 dou 2 sheng
