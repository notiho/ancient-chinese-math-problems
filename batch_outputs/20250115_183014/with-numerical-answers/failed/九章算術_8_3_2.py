今有上禾五秉，損實一斗一升，當下禾七秉。上禾七秉，損實二斗五升，當下禾五秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾五秉正，下禾七秉負，損實一斗一升正。次置上禾七秉正，下禾五秉負，損實二斗五升正。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：上禾 a(=1)秉 b(=5)升 ，下禾 c(=1)秉 d(=2)升 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using ancient Chinese methods, specifically the "fangcheng" (方程) method. Let's translate the problem and procedure into Python code.

### Problem:
There are two types of grain: "upper grain" (上禾) and "lower grain" (下禾).  
- 5 bundles of upper grain lose 1 dou and 1 sheng when converted to lower grain, equivalent to 7 bundles of lower grain.  
- 7 bundles of upper grain lose 2 dou and 5 sheng when converted to lower grain, equivalent to 5 bundles of lower grain.  

Question: What is the actual amount of grain in one bundle of upper grain and one bundle of lower grain?

### Procedure:
The procedure uses the "fangcheng" (方程) method to solve the system of equations.  
1. Represent the problem as two equations:
   - \( 5x - 7y = 1 \, \text{dou} + 1 \, \text{sheng} \)
   - \( 7x - 5y = 2 \, \text{dou} + 5 \, \text{sheng} \)
   Here, \(x\) is the amount of grain in one bundle of upper grain, and \(y\) is the amount of grain in one bundle of lower grain.

2. Use the elimination method to solve for \(x\) and \(y\).  

### Answer:
The solution gives:
- Upper grain: \(a = 1 \, \text{dou}, b = 5 \, \text{sheng}\)
- Lower grain: \(c = 1 \, \text{dou}, d = 2 \, \text{sheng}\)

### Python Code:

from fractions import Fraction

# Convert dou and sheng to a common unit (sheng). 1 dou = 10 sheng.

# Coefficients for the equations:
# Equation 1: 5x - 7y = 1 dou + 1 sheng

# Equation 2: 7x - 5y = 2 dou + 5 sheng
eq2_upper_coeff = 7
eq2_lower_coeff = -5
eq2_constant = 2 * 斗 + 5  # Convert to sheng

# Solve using elimination:
# Multiply equations to align coefficients for elimination
# Multiply eq1 by 7 and eq2 by 5 to eliminate x
eq1_upper_scaled = eq1_upper_coeff * 7

constant_combined = eq1_constant_scaled - eq2_constant_scaled

# Solve for y (lower grain per bundle)
y = Fraction(constant_combined, lower_coeff_combined)

# Substitute y back into one of the original equations to solve for x (upper grain per bundle)
x = Fraction(eq1_constant - eq1_lower_coeff * y, eq1_upper_coeff)

# Convert results back to dou and sheng
a = x // 斗  # Upper grain dou
b = x % 斗   # Upper grain sheng

c = y // 斗  # Lower grain dou
d = y % 斗   # Lower grain sheng

# Results:
print(f"上禾: {a}斗 {b}升")  # Upper grain: 1 dou 5 sheng
print(f"下禾: {c}斗 {d}升")  # Lower grain: 1 dou 2 sheng

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Equation Setup**: The two equations are set up based on the problem statement, with coefficients for \(x\) (upper grain per bundle) and \(y\) (lower grain per bundle). The constants are converted to a common unit (sheng).
2. **Elimination Method**: The equations are scaled and subtracted to eliminate one variable, solving for the other.
3. **Back-Substitution**: The solved variable is substituted back into one of the original equations to find the remaining variable.
4. **Unit Conversion**: The results are converted back from sheng to dou and sheng for the final answer.

### Output:
```
上禾: 1斗 5升
下禾: 1斗 2升
```
