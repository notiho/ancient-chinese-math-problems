今有田一畝，收粟六升、太半升。今有田一頃二十六畝一百五十九步，問︰收粟幾何？
術曰：以畝二百四十步為法，以六升、太半升乘今有田積步為實，實如法得粟數。
荅曰： a(=10133/1200)斛 。

Suppose there is 1 mu of land, yielding 6 sheng and a little more than half a sheng of millet.
Now suppose there is 1 qing, 26 mu, and 159 bu of land.
Question: how much millet is harvested?

The procedure says: Take 240 bu per mu as the divisor.
Multiply 6 sheng and a little more than half a sheng by the total area of land in bu, obtaining the dividend.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to obtain the amount of millet.

Answer: *a*(=10133/1200) hu.
