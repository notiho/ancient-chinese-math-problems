今有甲乙二人持錢不知其數。甲得乙半而錢五十，乙得甲太半而亦錢五十。問︰甲、乙持錢各幾何？
術曰：如方程，損益之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：甲持 a(=75/2)錢 ，乙持 b(=25)錢 。

This problem involves solving a system of equations using a method akin to elimination or substitution, as described in ancient Chinese mathematics. Let's break it down and implement it step by step in Python.

The problem states:

甲 (Person A) and 乙 (Person B) each hold an unknown amount of money.  
- If 甲 takes half of 乙's money, he will have 50.  
- If 乙 takes more than half of 甲's money (specifically, 3/2 of half of 甲's money), he will also have 50.  

We are tasked to find how much money 甲 and 乙 each hold.

The procedure involves setting up equations and solving them systematically.

---

### Step-by-step solution:

Let:
- `甲 = x` (amount of money Person A holds)
- `乙 = y` (amount of money Person B holds)

From the problem:
1. \( x + \frac{1}{2}y = 50 \)  
2. \( y + \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}x = 50 \)  
   Simplify the second equation: \( y + \frac{3}{4}x = 50 \).

Now, solve these equations using the ancient method described.

---

### Python implementation:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Define the equations:
# Equation 1: x + (1/2)y = 50
# Equation 2: y + (3/4)x = 50

# Step 1: Express y from Equation 1
# y = 2 * (50 - x)
def solve():
    # Express y in terms of x from the first equation
    y = 2 * (50 - x)

    # Substitute y into the second equation
    # y + (3/4)x = 50
    # 2 * (50 - x) + (3/4)x = 50
    eq2 = Fraction(2
