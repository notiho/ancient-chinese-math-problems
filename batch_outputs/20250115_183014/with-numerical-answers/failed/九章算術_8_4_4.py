今有上禾六秉，損實一斗八升，當下禾一十秉。下禾十五秉，損實五升，當上禾五秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾六秉正，下禾一十秉負，損實一斗八升正。次置上禾五秉負，下禾一十五秉正，損實五升正。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：上禾 a(=1)秉 實 b(=8)升 ，下禾 c(=1)秉 實 d(=3)升 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using ancient Chinese methods, specifically the "fangcheng" (方程) procedure. The problem is to determine the yield of one bundle of "upper millet" (上禾) and one bundle of "lower millet" (下禾) based on the given relationships. Below is the solution translated into Python code:

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Equation Setup**: The problem gives two equations based on the relationships between the upper millet (上禾) and lower millet (下禾). These equations are set up with their coefficients and results converted into a consistent unit (升).
2. **Fangcheng Method**: The method involves eliminating one variable (下禾) by combining the equations. This is done by multiplying each equation by the coefficient of the other equation's variable and then adding them together.
3. **Solve for One Variable**: After eliminating 下禾, the yield of one bundle of 上禾 is calculated.
4. **Substitute Back**: The yield of one bundle of 下禾 is calculated by substituting the result for 上禾 back into one of the original equations.
5. **Results**: The results are presented in terms of bundles (秉) and yields (升).

### Final Answer:
- 上禾: 1秉實 8升
- 下禾: 1秉實 3升
