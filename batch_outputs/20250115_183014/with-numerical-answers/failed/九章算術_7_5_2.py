今有共買羊，人出五，不足四十五；人出七，不足三。問︰人數、羊價各幾何？
兩盈、兩不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，以少減多，餘為實。兩盈、兩不足以少減多，餘為法。實如法而一。有分者通之。
荅曰： a(=21)人 ，羊價 b(=150) 。

Suppose a group of people collectively buy sheep. 
If each person contributes 5, they are short by 45. 
If each person contributes 7, they are short by 3. 
Question: how many people are there, and what is the price of the sheep?

The procedure for two excesses or two shortages says: 
Place the contribution rates, with the excess or shortage amounts below each. 
Multiply the contribution rates by their respective excess or shortage amounts. 
Subtract the smaller product from the larger product, and the remainder is the dividend. 
Subtract the smaller excess or shortage from the larger one, and the remainder is the divisor. 
Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the result. 
If there is a remainder, simplify it.

Answer: *a*(=21) people, and the price of the sheep is *b*(=150).
