今有上禾三秉，益實六斗，當下禾十秉。下禾五秉，益實一斗，當上禾二秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾三秉正，下禾一十秉負，益實六斗負。次置上禾二秉負，下禾五秉正，益實一斗負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：上禾 a(=1)秉 實 b(=8)斗 ，下禾 c(=1)秉 實 d(=3)斗 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using ancient Chinese methods, specifically the "fangcheng" (方程) method. The problem is to determine the yield (實) of one sheaf (秉) of upper millet (上禾) and lower millet (下禾). Here's the solution translated into Python:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Problem setup:
# 上禾三秉，益實六斗，當下禾十秉
# 下禾五秉，益實一斗，當上禾二秉

# Define the coefficients of the equations:
# Equation 1: 3 * 上禾 - 10 * 下禾 = -6
# Equation 2: -2 * 上禾 + 5 * 下禾 = -1

# Coefficients for 上禾 and 下禾
coefficients = [
    [3, -10, -6],  # Equation 1
    [-2, 5, -1]    # Equation 2
]

# Step 1: Eliminate one variable (using the fangcheng method)
# Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to align the coefficients of 上禾
eq1_scaled = [2 * x for x in coefficients[0]]  # [6, -20, -12]
eq2_scaled = [3 * x for x in coefficients[1]]  # [-6, 15, -3]

# Add the scaled equations to eliminate 上禾
eliminated_eq = [
    eq1_scaled[1] + eq2_scaled[1],  # Coefficient of 下禾
    eq1_scaled[2] + eq2_scaled[2]   # Constant term
]  # [-5, -15]

# Solve for 下禾 (one sheaf of lower millet)
下禾 = Fraction(-eliminated_eq[1], eliminated_eq[0])  # 下禾 = 3斗

# Substitute 下禾 back into one of the original equations to solve for 上禾
# Using Equation 1: 3 * 上禾 - 10 * 下禾 = -6
上禾 = Fraction(-coefficients[0][2] - coefficients[0][1] * 下禾, coefficients[0][0])  # 上禾 = 8斗

# Final results:
a = 1  # 上禾秉數
b = 上禾  # 上禾實 (8斗)
c = 1  # 下禾秉數
d = 下禾  # 下禾實 (3斗)

# Output results
print(f"上禾 {a} 秉 實 {b} 斗")
print(f"下禾 {c} 秉 實 {d} 斗")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Setup the Equations**: The problem is represented as two linear equations:
   - \( 3 \cdot 上禾 - 10 \cdot 下禾 = -6 \)
   - \( -2 \cdot 上禾 + 5 \cdot 下禾 = -1 \)

2. **Eliminate a Variable**: Using the fangcheng method, the equations are scaled and added to eliminate one variable (in this case, \( 上禾 \)).

3. **Solve for One Variable**: After elimination, the resulting equation is solved for \( 下禾 \).

4. **Back-Substitute**: The value of \( 下禾 \) is substituted back into one of the original equations to solve for \( 上禾 \).

5. **Results**: The yield per sheaf for \( 上禾 \) and \( 下禾 \) is calculated as \( 8 \) and \( 3 \)斗 respectively.

### Final Answer:
- 上禾 \( a = 1 \) 秉, 實 \( b = 8 \) 斗
- 下禾 \( c = 1 \) 秉, 實 \( d = 3 \) 斗
