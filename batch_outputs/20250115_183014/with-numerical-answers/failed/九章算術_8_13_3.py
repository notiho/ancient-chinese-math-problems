今有白禾二步、青禾三步、黃禾四步、黑禾五步，實各不滿斗。白取青、黃，青取黃、黑，黃取黑、白，黑取白、青，各一步，而實滿斗。問︰白、青、黃、黑禾實一步各幾何？
術曰：如方程，各置所取，以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：白禾 a(=1)步 實 b(=11/37)斗 ，青禾 c(=1)步 實 d(=28/111)斗 ，黃禾 e(=1)步 實 f(=17/111)斗 ，黑禾 g(=1)步 實 h(=10/111)斗 。

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Matrix Setup**: The coefficients matrix represents the relationships between the different types of grain (白禾, 青禾, 黃禾, 黑禾). The right-hand side (`rhs`) represents the total contribution to the full dou (斗).

2. **Fangcheng Method**: This is an ancient Chinese method for solving systems of linear equations. It involves normalizing rows and eliminating variables step by step, similar to Gaussian elimination.

3. **Normalization and Elimination**: Each row is normalized by dividing by the leading coefficient, and then the leading variable is eliminated from the other rows.

4. **Solution**: After the elimination process, the solution is found in the `rhs` array.

### Results:
- 白禾 (White grain): `a = 1` step, `b = 11/37` dou.
- 青禾 (Green grain): `c = 1` step, `d = 28/111` dou.
- 黃禾 (Yellow grain): `e = 1` step, `f = 17/111` dou.
- 黑禾 (Black grain): `g = 1` step, `h = 10/111` dou.
