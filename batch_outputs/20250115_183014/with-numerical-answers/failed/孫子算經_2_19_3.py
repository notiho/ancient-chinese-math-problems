This problem involves calculating the radius of a circle given its area. The ancient Chinese procedure for solving this involves a step-by-step approximation method. Let's translate the procedure into Python code.

"""
Suppose there is an area of 35,000 bu. 
Question: what is the radius of the circle?

The procedure says:
1. Place the area of 35,000 bu and multiply it by 12, obtaining 420,000 as the dividend.
2. Borrow one digit for the divisor, shifting the digits of the area one place to the left (to hundreds).
3. Place an initial quotient of 600 above the dividend, and place 60,000 below the dividend as the auxiliary.
4. The divisor above is called the "method of the square." Divide the dividend by the quotient, complete the division, and double the divisor.
5. Shift the divisor one place to the left, and shift the auxiliary two places to the left. Place the next quotient of 40 above the previous quotient, and place 400 below the divisor.
6. The divisor above is called the "method of the edge." Divide the dividend by the quotient, complete the division, and double the divisor.
7. Continue this process with the next quotient of 8, and place 8 below the divisor.
8. The divisor above is called the "method of the corner." Divide the dividend by the quotient, complete the division.

The answer says: *a*(=17498/27) bu.
