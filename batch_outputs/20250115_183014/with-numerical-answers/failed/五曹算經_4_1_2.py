Suppose there are 900 mu of official fields, and for every bu, 3 sheng and 2 he of millet are harvested.
Question: how much millet is harvested in total?

The procedure says: Place the 900 mu of fields, multiply it by 240 bu (the number of bu in one mu), obtaining 216,000 bu.
Multiply this by 3 sheng and 2 he, and the result is obtained.

Answer: *a*(=6912) hu.
