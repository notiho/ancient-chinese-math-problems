今有上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗；上禾二秉，中禾三秉，下禾一秉，實三十四斗；上禾一秉，中禾二秉，下禾三秉，實二十六斗。問︰上、中、下禾實一秉各幾何？
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾 a(=1)秉 ， b(=37/4)斗 ，中禾 c(=1)秉 ， d(=17/4)斗 ，下禾 e(=1)秉 ， f(=11/4)斗 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations to determine the yield of one bundle of upper, middle, and lower grain. The procedure described corresponds to solving the system using elimination and substitution. Below is the Python implementation of the procedure:

# Equations:
# 3a + 2b + 1c = 39
# 2a + 3b + 1c = 34
# 1a + 2b + 3c = 26

# Step 1: Represent the coefficients and constants
coefficients = [
    [3, 2, 1],  # Coefficients of the first equation
    [2, 3, 1],  # Coefficients of the second equation
    [1, 2, 3]   # Coefficients of the third equation
]
constants = [39, 34, 26]

# Step 2: Elimination to solve for c (下禾)
# Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3, then subtract
# (2 * [3a + 2b + 1c = 39]) - (3 * [2a + 3b + 1c = 34])
eq1 = [2 * x for x in coefficients[0]]
eq2 = [3 * x for x in coefficients[1]]
new_eq1 = [eq1[i] - eq2[i] for i in range(3)]
new_constant1 = 2 * constants[0] - 3 * constants[1]

# Multiply the second equation by 1 and the third equation by 3, then subtract
# ([2a + 3b + 1c = 34]) - (3 * [1a + 2b + 3c = 26])
eq3 = [3 * x for x in coefficients[2]]
new_eq2 = [coefficients[1][i] - eq3[i] for i in range(3)]

# Now we have two equations in terms of b and c:
# new_eq1: [0a + -5b + -1c = -29]
# new_eq2: [0a + -3b + -8c = -44]

# Step 3: Eliminate b to solve for c
# Multiply new_eq1 by 3 and new_eq2 by 5, then subtract
eq4 = [3 * x for x in new_eq1]
eq5 = [5 * x for x in new_eq2]
final_eq = [eq4[i] - eq5[i] for i in range(3)]
final_constant = 3 * new_constant1 - 5 * new_constant2

# final_eq: [0a + 0b + 23c = 133]
c = Fraction(final_constant, final_eq[2])  # c = 133 / 23 = 11/4

# Step 4: Back-substitute to solve for b
# Substitute c into new_eq1: -5b - 1c = -29
b = Fraction(new_constant1 - (-1 * c), new_eq1[1])  # b = 37 / 4

# Step 5: Back-substitute to solve for a
# Substitute b and c into the first original equation: 3a + 2b + 1c = 39
a = Fraction(constants[0] - (2 * b) - (1 * c), coefficients[0][0])  # a = 1

# Results
a秉 = 1
a斗 = a  # 1斗
b秉 = 1
b斗 = b  # 37/4斗
c秉 = 1
c斗 = c  # 11/4斗
