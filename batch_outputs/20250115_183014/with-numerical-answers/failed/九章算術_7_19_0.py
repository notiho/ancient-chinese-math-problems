今有人持錢之蜀，賈利十三。初返歸一萬四千，次返歸一萬三千，次返歸一萬二千，次返歸一萬一千，後返歸一萬。凡五返歸錢，本利俱盡。問︰本持錢及利各幾何？
術曰：假令本錢三萬，不足一千七百三十八錢半。令之四萬，多三萬五千三百九十錢八分。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰：本 a(=11312640000/371293)錢 。利 b(=10964940000/371293)錢 。

Suppose someone holds money in Shu (a region) and earns a profit of 13%. 
The first return is 14,000 qian, the second return is 13,000 qian, the third return is 12,000 qian, the fourth return is 11,000 qian, and the final return is 10,000 qian. 
In total, there are five returns, and the principal and profit are completely exhausted. 
Question: how much was the original principal, and how much was the profit?

The procedure says: Suppose the principal is 30,000 qian, it falls short by 1,738.5 qian. 
Suppose it is 40,000 qian, it exceeds by 35,390.8 qian. 
The procedure for excess and deficiency says: Place the given rates, and the excess and deficiency below each. 
Multiply the rates by their respective excess or deficiency, then add them to form the dividend. 
Add the excess and deficiency to form the divisor. 
Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the principal. 
If there are fractions, simplify them. 
For the profit, multiply the principal by the profit rate (13%).

Answer: The principal is *a*(=11312640000/371293) qian, and the profit is *b*(=10964940000/371293) qian.
