今有上禾五秉，損實一斗一升，當下禾七秉。上禾七秉，損實二斗五升，當下禾五秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾五秉正，下禾七秉負，損實一斗一升正。次置上禾七秉正，下禾五秉負，損實二斗五升正。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：上禾 a(=1)秉 b(=5)升 ，下禾 c(=1)秉 d(=2)升 。

This problem involves solving a system of equations using ancient Chinese methods, specifically the "fangcheng" (方程) method, which is an early form of linear algebra. The problem is to determine the yield of one bundle of "upper millet" (上禾) and one bundle of "lower millet" (下禾) based on the given conditions.

### Problem Breakdown:
- **Condition 1**: 5 bundles of upper millet (上禾) and 7 bundles of lower millet (下禾) lose 1 dou and 1 sheng (1斗1升).
- **Condition 2**: 7 bundles of upper millet (上禾) and 5 bundles of lower millet (下禾) lose 2 dou and 5 sheng (2斗5升).
- **Goal**: Find the yield of one bundle of upper millet (上禾) and one bundle of lower millet (下禾).

### Procedure:
The procedure involves setting up two equations and solving them using the fangcheng method. The equations are:
1. \( 5x + 7y = 1斗1升 \)
2. \( 7x + 5y = 2斗5升 \)

Where:
- \( x \) is the yield of one bundle of upper millet (上禾).
- \( y \) is the yield of one bundle of lower millet (下禾).

The solution involves eliminating one variable to solve for the other, then back-substituting to find the remaining variable.

下禾_2 = 5

下禾實 = Fraction(損實_diff, 下禾_diff)  # -48 / 24 = -2升 (negative because of subtraction)

# Substitute 下禾實 back into the first equation to solve for 上禾 (x)
上禾實 = Fraction(損實_1 - 下禾_1 * 下禾實, 上禾_1)  # (11 - 7 * -2) / 5 = (11 + 14) / 5 = 25 / 5 = 5升

上禾升 = 上禾實 % 斗   # Remainder (sheng)

下禾斗 = 下禾實 // 斗  # Integer part (dou)
下禾升 = 下禾實 % 斗   # Remainder (sheng)

# Final results
a = 上禾斗  # 1斗
b = 上禾升  # 5升
c = 下禾斗  # 1斗
d = 下禾升  # 2升

# Output results
a, b, c, d  # (1, 5, 1, 2)
