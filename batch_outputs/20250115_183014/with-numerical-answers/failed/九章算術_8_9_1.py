今有甲乙二人持錢不知其數。甲得乙半而錢五十，乙得甲太半而亦錢五十。問︰甲、乙持錢各幾何？
術曰：如方程，損益之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：甲持 a(=75/2)錢 ，乙持 b(=25)錢 。

Suppose there are two people, Jia and Yi, holding unknown amounts of money.
Jia takes half of Yi's money and has 50 qian, while Yi takes more than half of Jia's money and also has 50 qian.
Question: how much money does Jia and Yi each have?

The procedure says: Solve this using the method of simultaneous equations, which involves balancing gains and losses.

The method of simultaneous equations says: Place the upper grain as three bundles, the middle grain as two bundles, and the lower grain as one bundle, with a total of 39 dou on the right side. Arrange the middle and left grains as on the right side. Multiply the upper grain on the right by the middle row and divide by the direct value. Repeat this for the next step, also dividing by the direct value. Then, multiply the middle grain that does not divide evenly by the left row and divide by the direct value. For the left grain that does not divide evenly, the upper value becomes the divisor, and the lower value becomes the dividend. The dividend is the value of the lower grain. To find the middle grain, multiply the divisor by the middle row's lower value and divide by the lower grain's value. The remainder is the middle grain's value. To find the upper grain, multiply the divisor by the right row's lower value and divide by the lower and middle grain's values. The remainder is the upper grain's value. All values are calculated in this way, and each receives one dou.

Answer: Jia holds *a*(=75/2) qian, and Yi holds *b*(=25) qian.

# Let 甲持錢 = x, 乙持錢 = y
