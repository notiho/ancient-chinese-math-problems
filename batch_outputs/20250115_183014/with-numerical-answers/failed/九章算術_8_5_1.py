今有上禾三秉，益實六斗，當下禾十秉。下禾五秉，益實一斗，當上禾二秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾三秉正，下禾一十秉負，益實六斗負。次置上禾二秉負，下禾五秉正，益實一斗負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：上禾 a(=1)秉 實 b(=8)斗 ，下禾 c(=1)秉 實 d(=3)斗 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations to determine the yield of one sheaf of "upper millet" (上禾) and one sheaf of "lower millet" (下禾). The procedure uses a method similar to Gaussian elimination to solve the equations.

### Problem Statement:
There are:
1. 3 sheaves of upper millet (上禾) and an additional 6 dou of grain, equivalent to 10 sheaves of lower millet (下禾).
2. 5 sheaves of lower millet (下禾) and an additional 1 dou of grain, equivalent to 2 sheaves of upper millet (上禾).

Question: How much grain does one sheaf of upper millet (上禾) and one sheaf of lower millet (下禾) yield?

### Procedure:
The procedure describes solving the system of equations step by step, using elimination and substitution to find the yield of one sheaf of upper millet and one sheaf of lower millet.

### Solution in Python:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Define the system of equations:
# 1. 3上禾 - 10下禾 = -6
# 2. -2上禾 + 5下禾 = -1

# Coefficients for the equations
上禾1, 下禾1, 常數1 = 3, -10, -6  # First equation
上禾2, 下禾2, 常數2 = -2, 5, -1   # Second equation

# Step 1: Eliminate one variable (下禾) using the equations
# Multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 10 to align 下禾 coefficients
eq1_multiplied = [5 * 上禾1, 5 * 下禾1, 5 * 常數1]  # 15上禾 - 50下禾 = -30
eq2_multiplied = [10 * 上禾2, 10 * 下禾2, 10 * 常數2]  # -20上禾 + 50下禾 = -10

# Add the two equations to eliminate 下禾
eliminated_下禾 = [
    eq1_multiplied[0] + eq2_multiplied[0],  # 上禾 coefficient
    eq1_multiplied[1] + eq2_multiplied[1],  # 下禾 coefficient (should be 0)
    eq1_multiplied[2] + eq2_multiplied[2],  # Constant term
]  # -5上禾 = -40

# Solve for 上禾
上禾實 = Fraction(-eliminated_下禾[2], eliminated_下禾[0])  # 上禾 = 8斗

# Step 2: Substitute 上禾實 back into one of the original equations to solve for 下禾
# Using the first equation: 3上禾 - 10下禾 = -6
下禾實 = Fraction(上禾1 * 上禾實 + 常數1, -下禾1)  # 下禾 = 3斗

# Final results:
a = 1  # One sheaf of upper millet
b = 上禾實  # Yield of one sheaf of upper millet = 8斗
c = 1  # One sheaf of lower millet
d = 下禾實  # Yield of one sheaf of lower millet = 3斗

# Output results
print(f"上禾 {a}(=1)秉 實 {b}(=8)斗")
print(f"下禾 {c}(=1)秉 實 {d}(=3)斗")


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Define the equations**: The problem is represented as two linear equations with two variables (上禾 and 下禾).
2. **Eliminate one variable**: By aligning the coefficients of 下禾, we eliminate it by adding the equations.
3. **Solve for the remaining variable**: After eliminating 下禾, solve for 上禾.
4. **Substitute back**: Substitute the value of 上禾 into one of the original equations to solve for 下禾.
5. **Output the results**: The yields of one sheaf of upper millet and one sheaf of lower millet are calculated.

### Final Answer:
- 上禾 (one sheaf) yields **8斗**.
- 下禾 (one sheaf) yields **3斗**.
