今有白禾二步、青禾三步、黃禾四步、黑禾五步，實各不滿斗。白取青、黃，青取黃、黑，黃取黑、白，黑取白、青，各一步，而實滿斗。問︰白、青、黃、黑禾實一步各幾何？
術曰：如方程，各置所取，以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：白禾 a(=1)步 實 b(=11/37)斗 ，青禾 c(=1)步 實 d(=28/111)斗 ，黃禾 e(=1)步 實 f(=17/111)斗 ，黑禾 g(=1)步 實 h(=10/111)斗 。

Suppose there are white millet (白禾) of 2 bu, green millet (青禾) of 3 bu, yellow millet (黃禾) of 4 bu, and black millet (黑禾) of 5 bu.
Each is not full of a dou. 
The white millet takes from the green and yellow millet, the green millet takes from the yellow and black millet, the yellow millet takes from the black and white millet, and the black millet takes from the white and green millet, each taking 1 bu, and the total fills 1 dou.
Question: how much does each bu of white, green, yellow, and black millet contribute to the dou?

The procedure says: Treat it as a system of equations, and set up the contributions taken by each millet. Use the positive-negative method to solve.

The fangcheng (system of equations) procedure says:
1. Place the coefficients for the top millet (上禾), middle millet (中禾), and bottom millet (下禾) in rows, and place the total (實) on the right side.
2. Arrange the middle and left millet coefficients similarly to the right side.
3. Multiply the top row by the middle row and divide directly.
4. Multiply again by the next row and divide directly.
5. For the middle row, multiply the middle millet coefficients by the left row and divide directly.
6. For the bottom millet, use the top coefficient as the divisor and the bottom coefficient as the dividend. The result is the bottom millet's contribution.
7. To find the middle millet's contribution, multiply the divisor by the middle row's bottom value and divide by the bottom millet's contribution. The remainder corresponds to the middle millet's contribution.
8. To find the top millet's contribution, multiply the divisor by the top row's bottom value and divide by the bottom and middle millet's contributions. The remainder corresponds to the top millet's contribution.
9. Each millet's contribution is determined in this way.

The answer says:
White millet contributes *a*(=1) bu and *b*(=11/37) dou.
Green millet contributes *c*(=1) bu and *d*(=28/111) dou.
Yellow millet contributes *e*(=1) bu and *f*(=17/111) dou.
Black millet contributes *g*(=1) bu and *h*(=10/111) dou.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Matrix Setup**: The system of equations is represented as a matrix where each row corresponds to one millet's equation.
2. **Gaussian Elimination**: The matrix is reduced row by row to eliminate variables and simplify the equations.
3. **Back-Substitution**: Starting from the last variable (black millet), each variable is solved step by step using the simplified equations.
4. **Results**: The contributions of each millet to the dou are calculated and stored in variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`.

### Final Answer:
- White millet contributes `1` bu and `11/37` dou.
- Green millet contributes `1` bu and `28/111` dou.
- Yellow millet contributes `1` bu and `17/111` dou.
- Black millet contributes `1` bu and `10/111` dou.
