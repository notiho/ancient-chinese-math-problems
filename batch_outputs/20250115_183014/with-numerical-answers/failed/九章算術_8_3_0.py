今有上禾五秉，損實一斗一升，當下禾七秉。上禾七秉，損實二斗五升，當下禾五秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾五秉正，下禾七秉負，損實一斗一升正。次置上禾七秉正，下禾五秉負，損實二斗五升正。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：上禾 a(=1)秉 b(=5)升 ，下禾 c(=1)秉 d(=2)升 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using ancient Chinese mathematical methods, specifically the "fangcheng" (方程) method. Below is the translation of the problem and its solution into Python code.

### Problem:
"""
There are 5 bundles of upper millet (上禾), which lose 1 dou and 1 sheng of grain, corresponding to 7 bundles of lower millet (下禾).  
There are 7 bundles of upper millet, which lose 2 dou and 5 sheng of grain, corresponding to 5 bundles of lower millet.  
Question: How much grain does one bundle of upper millet and one bundle of lower millet yield?

Procedure: Use the fangcheng (方程) method.  
Place 5 bundles of upper millet as positive, 7 bundles of lower millet as negative, and the loss of 1 dou and 1 sheng as positive.  
Next, place 7 bundles of upper millet as positive, 5 bundles of lower millet as negative, and the loss of 2 dou and 5 sheng as positive.  
Use the positive-negative method to solve.

Fangcheng method:  
1. Place the coefficients of upper millet, lower millet, and the total loss in rows.  
2. Use elimination to simplify the system of equations.  
3. Solve for the unknowns step by step.  

Answer: The yield of one bundle of upper millet is *a*(=1) dou and *b*(=5) sheng.  
The yield of one bundle of lower millet is *c*(=1) dou and *d*(=2) sheng.

### Solution in Python:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Convert dou and sheng to a single unit (sheng), as 1 dou = 10 sheng
def convert_to_sheng(dou, sheng):
    return dou * 10 + sheng

# Convert sheng back to dou and sheng
def convert_to_dou_sheng(sheng):
    dou = sheng // 10
    remaining_sheng = sheng % 10
    return dou, remaining_sheng

# Given data
上禾_1 = 5  # Coefficient for upper millet in the first equation
下禾_1 = -7  # Coefficient for lower millet in the first equation
損實_1 = convert_to_sheng(1, 1)  # Loss in the first equation (1 dou 1 sheng)

上禾_2 = 7  # Coefficient for upper millet in the second equation
下禾_2 = -5  # Coefficient for lower millet in the second equation
損實_2 = convert_to_sheng(2, 5)  # Loss in the second equation (2 dou 5 sheng)

# Step 1: Eliminate one variable (use 上禾 as the pivot)
# Multiply the first equation by 7 (coefficient of 上禾 in the second equation)
# Multiply the second equation by 5 (coefficient of 上禾 in the first equation)
# Subtract the equations to eliminate 上禾
上禾_elim = 上禾_1 * 7 - 上禾_2 * 5  # This should be 0
下禾_elim = 下禾_1 * 7 - 下禾_2 * 5
損實_elim = 損實_1 * 7 - 損實_2 * 5

# Step 2: Solve for 下禾 (lower millet)

# Step 3: Solve for 上禾 (upper millet)
損實_1_adjusted = 損實_1 - 下禾_1 * 下禾實
上禾實 = Fraction(損實_1_adjusted, 上禾_1)

# Convert results back to dou and sheng
上禾_dou, 上禾_sheng = convert_to_dou_sheng(上禾實)
下禾_dou, 下禾_sheng = convert_to_dou_sheng(下禾實)

# Final results
a, b = 上禾_dou, 上禾_sheng  # Upper millet yield
c, d = 下禾_dou, 下禾_sheng  # Lower millet yield

print(f"上禾: {a} dou {b} sheng")
print(f"下禾: {c} dou {d} sheng")


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Unit Conversion**: Since the problem involves dou and sheng, all values are converted into sheng for calculation (1 dou = 10 sheng).
2. **Elimination**: The system of equations is solved using elimination to remove one variable (上禾 or 下禾).
3. **Back Substitution**: Once one variable is solved, the other is calculated using substitution.
4. **Result Conversion**: The results are converted back into dou and sheng for the final answer.

### Output:
```
上禾: 1 dou 5 sheng
下禾: 1 dou 2 sheng
```
