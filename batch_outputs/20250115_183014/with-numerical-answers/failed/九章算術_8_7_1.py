今有賣牛二、羊五，以買十三豕，有餘錢一千。賣牛三、豕三，以買九羊，錢適足。賣羊六、豕八，以買五牛，錢不足六百。問︰牛、羊、豕價各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置牛二、羊五正，豕一十三負，餘錢數正；次牛三正，羊九負，豕三正；次牛五負，羊六正，豕八正，不足錢負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：牛價 a(=1200) ，羊價 b(=500) ，豕價 c(=300) 。

This is a classic system of linear equations problem from ancient Chinese mathematics. The problem involves determining the prices of cows, sheep, and pigs based on the given transactions. The solution uses the method of elimination, as described in the "方程術" (method of solving simultaneous linear equations). Below is the Python implementation of the solution:

# Define the equations based on the problem statement:
# 1. 2牛 + 5羊 - 13豕 = 1000
# 2. 3牛 - 9羊 + 3豕 = 0
# 3. -5牛 + 6羊 + 8豕 = -600

# Coefficients of 牛, 羊, 豕, and the constants
equation1 = [2, 5, -13, 1000]
equation2 = [3, -9, 3, 0]
equation3 = [-5, 6, 8, -600]

# Step 1: Eliminate the first variable (牛) from equation2 and equation3
# Multiply equation1 by 3 and equation2 by 2, then subtract
factor1 = 3
factor2 = 2
new_eq2 = [
    factor1 * equation2[i] - factor2 * equation1[i] for i in range(4)

# Multiply new_eq2 by 6 and new_eq3 by 49, then subtract
factor1 = 6
factor2 = 49

    factor1 * new_eq3[i] - factor2 * new_eq2[i] for i in range(4)

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Step 1:** Eliminate the first variable (牛) from the second and third equations using the elimination method.
2. **Step 2:** Eliminate the second variable (羊) from the resulting two equations.
3. **Step 3:** Solve for the third variable (豕) directly from the final equation.
4. **Step 4:** Back-substitute the value of 豕 into the second equation to solve for 羊.
5. **Step 5:** Back-substitute the values of 豕 and 羊 into the first equation to solve for 牛.

### Final Answer:
- 牛價 \(a = 1200\)
- 羊價 \(b = 500\)
- 豕價 \(c = 300\)
