今有善田一畝，價三百；惡田七畝，價五百。今并買一頃，價錢一萬。問︰善、惡田各幾何？
術曰：假令善田二十畝，惡田八十畝，多一千七百一十四錢、七分錢之二。令之善田一十畝，惡田九十畝，不足五百七十一錢、七分錢之三。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰：善田 a(=25/2)畝 ，惡田 b(=175/2)畝 。

Suppose there is good land, 1 mu, worth 300 coins; and poor land, 7 mu, worth 500 coins.
Now, buying 1 qing (100 mu) together costs 10,000 coins.
Question: how much good land and poor land are there respectively?

The procedure says: Suppose there are 20 mu of good land and 80 mu of poor land, resulting in an excess of 1714 coins and 2/7 of a coin.
Suppose there are 10 mu of good land and 90 mu of poor land, resulting in a deficit of 571 coins and 3/7 of a coin.

The method of excess and deficit says: Place the rates of what is produced, and place the excess and deficit below each.
Multiply the rates by the respective excess or deficit, and sum them to form the dividend.
Sum the excess and deficit to form the divisor.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the unit amount.
If there are fractions, handle them consistently.
For the good and poor land, place the rates, subtract the smaller from the larger, and simplify the divisor and dividend.
The dividend represents the value of the goods, and the divisor represents the number of people.

Answer: *a*(=25/2) mu of good land, *b*(=175/2) mu of poor land.
