今有地，長一千步，廣五百步，尺有鶉、寸有鷃。問鶉、鷃各幾何？
術曰：置長一千步，以廣五百步乘之，得五十萬；以三十六乘之，得一千八百萬尺，即得鶉數；上十之，即得鷃數。
答曰：鶉 a(=18000000) ，鷃 b(=1000080000000) 。

Suppose there is a piece of land, with a length of 1000 bu and a width of 500 bu. 
Each chi contains quails (鶉), and each cun contains sparrows (鷃).
Question: how many quails and sparrows are there respectively?

The procedure says: Place the length of 1000 bu, and multiply it by the width of 500 bu, obtaining 500,000.
Multiply this by 36, obtaining 18,000,000 chi, which gives the number of quails (鶉).
Multiply this by 10, obtaining the number of sparrows (鷃).

Answer: *a*(=18,000,000) quails, *b*(=1,000,080,000,000) sparrows.
