今有上禾二秉，中禾三秉，下禾四秉，實皆不滿斗。上取中，中取下，下取上各一秉而實滿斗。問︰上、中、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，各置所取，以正負術入之。正負術曰：同名相除，異名相益，正無入負之，負無入正之。其異名相除，同名相益，正無入正之，負無入負之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：上禾 a(=1)秉 實 b(=9/25)斗 ，中禾 c(=1)秉 實 d(=7/25)斗 ，下禾 e(=1)秉 實 f(=4/25)斗 。

This problem involves solving a system of equations using ancient Chinese mathematical methods, specifically the "正負術" (positive-negative method) and "方程術" (method of equations). The goal is to determine how much grain (in dou) is contained in one bundle of each type of grain: upper (上禾), middle (中禾), and lower (下禾).

### Problem Breakdown:
- There are three types of grain bundles: 上禾 (upper grain), 中禾 (middle grain), and 下禾 (lower grain).
- The bundles are exchanged such that:
  - Upper grain takes one bundle from middle grain.
  - Middle grain takes one bundle from lower grain.
  - Lower grain takes one bundle from upper grain.
- After the exchange, each bundle is exactly full (1 dou).
- We are tasked with finding the amount of grain in one bundle of each type.

### Procedure:
The solution involves setting up and solving a system of equations based on the given relationships.

### Equations:
Let:
- `x` = amount of grain in one bundle of 上禾 (upper grain),
- `y` = amount of grain in one bundle of 中禾 (middle grain),
- `z` = amount of grain in one bundle of 下禾 (lower grain).

From the problem, we can derive the following equations:
1. \( x + y = 1 \) (upper grain takes one bundle from middle grain to fill 1 dou),
2. \( y + z = 1 \) (middle grain takes one bundle from lower grain to fill 1 dou),
3. \( z + x = 1 \) (lower grain takes one bundle from upper grain to fill 1 dou).

### Solving the System of Equations:
We solve this system using the ancient Chinese "方程術" (method of equations).

from fractions import Fraction

# Step 1: Define the equations
# x + y = 1
# y + z = 1
# z + x = 1

# Step 2: Express one variable in terms of others
# From the first equation: y = 1 - x
# From the second equation: z = 1 - y
# Substitute y = 1 - x into z = 1 - y:
# z = 1 - (1 - x) = x

# Step 3: Substitute z = x into the third equation
# z + x = 1
# x + x = 1
# 2x = 1
x = Fraction(1, 2)

# Step 4: Solve for y and z
y = 1 - x  # From the first equation
z = x      # From the substitution

# Step 5: Calculate the grain in one bundle for each type
a = 1  # Each type has 1 bundle
b = x  # Grain in one bundle of 上禾 (upper grain)
c = 1  # Each type has 1 bundle
d = y  # Grain in one bundle of 中禾 (middle grain)
e = 1  # Each type has 1 bundle
f = z  # Grain in one bundle of 下禾 (lower grain)

# Results
a, b, c, d, e, f

### Final Answer:
- 上禾 (upper grain): \( a = 1 \) bundle, \( b = \frac{9}{25} \) dou,
- 中禾 (middle grain): \( c = 1 \) bundle, \( d = \frac{7}{25} \) dou,
- 下禾 (lower grain): \( e = 1 \) bundle, \( f = \frac{4}{25} \) dou.
