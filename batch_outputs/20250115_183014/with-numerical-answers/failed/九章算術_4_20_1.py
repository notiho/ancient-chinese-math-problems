今有積六萬三千四百一尺、五百一十二分尺之四百四十七。問︰為立方幾何？
開立方術曰：置積為實。借一算步之，超二等。議所得，以再乘所借一算為法，而除之。除已，三之為定法。復除，折而下。以三乘所得數置中行。復借一算置下行。步之，中超一，下超二等。復置議，以一乘中，再乘下，皆副以加定法。以定法除。除已，倍下、并中從定法。復除，折下如前。開之不盡者，亦為不可開。若積有分者，通分內子為定實。定實乃開之，訖，開其母以報除。若母不可開者，又以母再乘定實，乃開之。訖，令如母而一。
荅曰： a(=319/8)尺 。

Suppose there is a volume of 63401 chi and 447/512 chi^3.
Question: what is the cube root of this volume?

The procedure for extracting cube roots says:
1. Place the volume as the dividend. Borrow one counting rod and mark off two places from the right.
2. Estimate the root, and multiply it by itself twice to form the divisor. Divide the dividend by the divisor.
3. Multiply the quotient by 3 to form the provisional divisor. Subtract and bring down the next term.
4. Multiply the current root by 3 and place it in the middle row. Borrow one counting rod and place it in the lower row.
5. Estimate the next digit of the root. Multiply the middle row by the new digit, and multiply the lower row by the square of the new digit. Add these to the provisional divisor.
6. Divide the dividend by the updated divisor. Repeat the process until the root is fully extracted.
7. If the volume has fractional parts, convert the entire volume to a fraction and perform the extraction. Afterward, extract the cube root of the denominator and adjust accordingly.

Answer: *a*(=319/8) chi.
