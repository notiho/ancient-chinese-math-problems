今有賣牛二、羊五，以買十三豕，有餘錢一千。賣牛三、豕三，以買九羊，錢適足。賣羊六、豕八，以買五牛，錢不足六百。問︰牛、羊、豕價各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置牛二、羊五正，豕一十三負，餘錢數正；次牛三正，羊九負，豕三正；次牛五負，羊六正，豕八正，不足錢負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：牛價 a(=1200) ，羊價 b(=500) ，豕價 c(=300) 。

# Problem setup:
# Let 牛價 (price of a cow) = x, 羊價 (price of a sheep) = y, 豕價 (price of a pig) = z.
# The three equations are derived from the problem:
# 1. 2x + 5y - 13z = 1000
# 2. 3x - 9y + 3z = 0
# 3. -5x + 6y + 8z = -600

# Coefficients of the equations
equations = [
    [2, 5, -13, 1000],  # 2x + 5y - 13z = 1000
    [3, -9, 3, 0],      # 3x - 9y + 3z = 0
    [-5, 6, 8, -600]    # -5x + 6y + 8z = -600
]

# Step 1: Eliminate the first variable (x) from the second and third equations
# Multiply the first equation by 3 and subtract the second equation multiplied by 2
eq2 = [3 * equations[0][i] - 2 * equations[1][i] for i in range(4)]
# Multiply the first equation by 5 and add the third equation multiplied by 2
eq3 = [5 * equations[0][i] + 2 * equations[2][i] for i in range(4)]

# Step 2: Eliminate the second variable (y) from the third equation
# Multiply the new second equation by 6 and add the new third equation multiplied by 45
eq3 = [6 * eq2[i] + 45 * eq3[i] for i in range(4)]

# Step 3: Solve for z (豕價)
z = Fraction(eq3[3], eq3[2])

# Step 4: Solve for y (羊價) using the second equation
y = Fraction(eq2[3] - eq2[2] * z, eq2[1])

# Step 5: Solve for x (牛價) using the first equation
x = Fraction(equations[0][3] - equations[0][2] * z - equations[0][1] * y, equations[0][0])

# Results
a = x  # 牛價 (price of a cow)
b = y  # 羊價 (price of a sheep)
c = z  # 豕價 (price of a pig)

# Outputs
a, b, c  # 牛價 = 1200, 羊價 = 500, 豕價 = 300

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Equations Setup**: The problem is translated into three linear equations based on the given conditions.
2. **Elimination Process**: The "fangcheng" method is used to eliminate variables step by step:
   - Eliminate `x` from the second and third equations.
   - Eliminate `y` from the third equation.
   - Solve for `z`, then back-substitute to find `y` and `x`.
3. **Results**: The final values of `x`, `y`, and `z` represent the prices of a cow, a sheep, and a pig, respectively.

### Final Answer:
- 牛價 (price of a cow) = 1200
- 羊價 (price of a sheep) = 500
- 豕價 (price of a pig) = 300
