今有冥谷上廣二丈，袤七丈，下廣八尺，袤四丈，深六丈五尺。問︰積幾何？
荅曰：五萬二千尺。
荅曰：人到二百一尺、五十分尺之十三。用徒二百五十八人、一萬六十三分人之三千七百四十六。
術曰：以一車積尺乘程行步數為實。置今往來步數，加載輸之間一里，以車六人乘之，為法。除之，所得即一人所到尺。以所到約積尺，即用徒人數。
荅曰：人到 a(=10063/50)尺 。用徒 b(=2600000/10063)人 。

Suppose there is a valley with the following dimensions:
- The upper width is 2 zhang, and the length is 7 zhang.
- The lower width is 8 chi, and the length is 4 zhang.
- The depth is 6 zhang and 5 chi.

Question: What is the total volume of the valley?

Answer: The total volume is 52000 cubic chi.

Additionally:
- How far does one person transport in chi?
- How many workers are needed to transport the total volume?

The procedure says:
- Multiply the volume of one cart (in cubic chi) by the number of steps traveled to get the dividend.
- Add the round-trip steps and the distance between loading and unloading (1 li), and multiply this by 6 (the number of people per cart) to get the divisor.
- Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the distance one person transports in chi.
- Divide the total volume by the distance one person transports to find the number of workers needed.

Answer:
- Each person transports *a*(=10063/50) chi.
- The number of workers needed is *b*(=2600000/10063).
