今有蒲生一日，長三尺。莞生一日，長一尺。蒲生日自半。莞生日自倍。問︰幾何日而長等？
術曰：假令二日，不足一尺五寸。令之三日，有餘一尺七寸半。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰： a(=32/13)日 。各長 b(=63/13)尺 。

Suppose there is a cattail (pu) that grows 3 chi in one day, and a rush (guan) that grows 1 chi in one day.
The cattail starts growing from half its length, and the rush starts growing from double its length.
Question: after how many days will their lengths be equal?

The procedure says: Suppose 2 days, the difference is less than 1 chi 5 cun.
Suppose 3 days, the difference exceeds 1 chi 7 cun and a half.

The "Excess and Deficit" procedure says: Place the rates of growth, with the excess and deficit below each.
Multiply the rates of growth by the respective excess or deficit, and add them to form the dividend.
Add the excess and deficit to form the divisor.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the number of days.
If there is a fraction, simplify it.
If the excess and deficit are associated with the same object, place the rates of growth, subtract the smaller from the larger, and use the remainder to simplify the divisor and dividend.
The dividend becomes the price of the object, and the divisor becomes the number of people.

Answer: *a*(=32/13) days. Each grows to *b*(=63/13) chi.
