今有出錢一萬三千九百七十，買絲一石二鈞二十八斤三兩五銖。欲其貴賤斤率之，問︰各幾何？
其率術曰：各置所買石、鈞、斤、兩以為法，以所率乘錢數為實，實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法賤實貴。
荅曰：其 a(=18013/11520)石 ，斤 b(=67)錢 。其 c(=7897/384)斤 ，斤 d(=68)錢 。

Suppose there is an expenditure of 13,970 qian to buy 1 shi, 2 jun, 28 jin, 3 liang, and 5 zhu of silk.
It is desired to calculate the price per jin (unit rate of price per weight).
Question: what is the price per jin?

The procedure for rates says: Place the quantities of shi, jun, jin, and liang as the divisor.
Multiply the total money spent by the rate to obtain the dividend.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to obtain the unit rate.
If the divisor does not divide evenly, subtract the divisor from the dividend, and the divisor represents the cheaper rate, while the dividend represents the more expensive rate.

Answer: The price per shi is *a*(=18013/11520) qian, and the price per jin is *b*(=67) qian.
The price per jin is also *c*(=7897/384) qian, and the price per jin is *d*(=68) qian.
