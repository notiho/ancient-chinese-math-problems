Multiply the volume of grain by the \"\u659b\u6cd5\" (conversion factor for volume to cubic chi) to get the total cubic chi (\u7a4d\u5c3a).\n2.

Multiply the removed grain volume by the \"\u659b\u6cd5\" and by 3, then multiply by the squared height and divide by the squared difference between the sides to get the \"\u5be6\" (adjusted volume for removed grain).\n2. Multiply the height by the top side and divide by the difference between the sides to get the \"\u5c0f\u9ad8\" (small height adjustment).\n3. Square the small height adjustment, multiply by 3 to get the \"\u65b9\u6cd5\" (method divisor for the cube root).\n4. Multiply the small height adjustment by 3 to get the \"\u5ec9\u6cd5\" (method divisor for the cube root).\n5. Solve for the removed grain height by taking the cube root of the ratio of the adjusted volume to the method divisor.\n6. Subtract the removed grain height from the total height to get the remaining grain depth.\n7.
