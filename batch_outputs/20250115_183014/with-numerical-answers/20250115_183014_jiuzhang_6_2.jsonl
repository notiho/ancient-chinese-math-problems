The bottom 3 nodes hold 4 sheng, and the top 4 nodes hold 3 sheng.\nQuestion: how much should the middle 2 nodes hold to balance the capacity evenly?\n\nThe procedure says: Divide the 4 sheng among the bottom 3 nodes to get the bottom rate, and divide the 3 sheng among the top 4 nodes to get the top rate.\nSubtract the smaller rate from the larger rate, and the remainder is the dividend.\nPlace the 4 nodes and 3 nodes, halve each, and subtract from the 9 nodes. The remainder is the divisor.\nDivide the dividend by the divisor to get 1 sheng, which is the difference between successive nodes.\nThe bottom rate, plus 1 sheng and half a sheng less, gives the capacity of the second node from the bottom.\n\nAnswer: The capacities of the nodes are:\n*a*(=95/66) sheng, *b*(=4/3) sheng, *c*(=27/22) sheng, *d*(=37/33) sheng, *e*(=67/66) sheng, *f*(=10/11) sheng, *g*(=53/66) sheng, *h*(=23/33) sheng, *i*(=13/22) sheng.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# \u4e0b\u4e09\u7bc0\u5bb9\u56db\u5347\n\u4e0b\u7bc0\u6578 = 3\n\u4e0b\u7e3d\u5347 = 4\n\n# \u4e0a\u56db\u7bc0\u5bb9\u4e09\u5347\n\u4e0a\u7bc0\u6578 = 4\n\u4e0a\u7e3d\u5347 = 3\n\n# \u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e09\u7bc0\u5206\u56db\u5347\u70ba\u4e0b\u7387\n\u4e0b\u7387 = Fraction(\u4e0b\u7e3d\u5347, \u4e0b\u7bc0\u6578)\n\n# \u4ee5\u4e0a\u56db\u7bc0\u5206\u4e09\u5347\u70ba\u4e0a\u7387\n\u4e0a\u7387 = Fraction(\u4e0a\u7e3d\u5347, \u4e0a\u7bc0\u6578)\n\n# \u4e0a\u4e0b\u7387\u4ee5\u5c11\u6e1b\u591a\uff0c\u9918\u70ba\u5be6\n\u5be6 = abs(\u4e0b\u7387 - \u4e0a\u7387)\n\n# \u7f6e\u56db\u7bc0\u3001\u4e09\u7bc0\uff0c\u5404\u534a\u4e4b\n\u4e0a\u534a\u7bc0\u6578 = Fraction(\u4e0a\u7bc0\u6578, 2)\n\u4e0b\u534a\u7bc0\u6578 = Fraction(\u4e0b\u7bc0\u6578, 2)\n\n# \u4ee5\u6e1b\u4e5d\u7bc0\uff0c\u9918\u70ba\u6cd5\n\u7e3d\u7bc0\u6578 = 9\n\u6cd5 = \u7e3d\u7bc0\u6578 - (\u4e0a\u534a\u7bc0\u6578 + \u4e0b\u534a\u7bc0\u6578)\n\n# \u5be6\u5982\u6cd5\u5f97\u4e00\u5347\uff0c\u5373\u8870\u76f8\u53bb\u4e5f\n\u4e00\u5347 = Fraction(\u5be6, \u6cd5)\n\n# \u8a08\u7b97\u6bcf\u7bc0\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\n\u7bc0\u5bb9\u91cf = []\nfor i in range(\u7e3d\u7bc0\u6578):\n    if i < \u4e0b\u7bc0\u6578:  # \u4e0b\u4e09\u7bc0\n        \u5bb9\u91cf = \u4e0b\u7387 + i * \u4e00\u5347\n    elif i < \u4e0b\u7bc0\u6578 + 2:  # \u4e2d\u9593\u4e8c\u7bc0\n        \u5bb9\u91cf = \u4e0b\u7387 + \u4e0b\u7bc0\u6578 * \u4e00\u5347 + (i - \u4e0b\u7bc0\u6578) * \u4e00\u5347\n    else:  # \u4e0a\u56db\u7bc0\n        \u5bb9\u91cf = \u4e0a\u7387 + (\u7e3d\u7bc0\u6578 - 1 - i) * \u4e00\u5347\n    \u7bc0\u5bb9\u91cf.append(\u5bb9\u91cf)\n\n# Assigning results to variables\na, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i = \u7bc0\u5bb9\u91cf  # 95/66, 4/3, 27/22, 37/33, 67/66, 10/11, 53/66, 23/33, 13/22", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2136, "completion_tokens": 3542, "total_tokens": 5678, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_60a3f2dc65"}}, "error": null}
