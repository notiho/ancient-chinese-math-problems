Two poles are erected, one to the south and one to the north, with a distance of 9 zhang between them. A rope is stretched across the ground connecting them. \nStanding west of the northern pole, 6 zhang away from it, the observer looks across the ground to the southern bank of the river mouth. The rope enters the northern end by 4 zhang and 2 cun. \nLooking at the northern bank, the rope enters the previous pole by 1 zhang and 2 chi. \nThe observer then steps back further, 13 zhang and 5 chi away from the pole. Looking across the ground to the southern bank of the river mouth, the rope aligns with the southern pole. \nQuestion: how wide is the river mouth?\n\nThe procedure says: Multiply the distance from the second position to the pole by the rope's entry at the northern end. Divide by the distance between the poles. Subtract the first position's distance from the pole from the result, and take the remainder as the divisor. \nThen subtract the second position's distance from the first position's distance, and multiply the result by the rope's entry at the previous pole to get the dividend.
