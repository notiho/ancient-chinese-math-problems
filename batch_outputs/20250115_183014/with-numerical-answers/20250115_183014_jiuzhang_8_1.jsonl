Each horse is tasked with carrying 40 shi (\u77f3) of weight up a slope but cannot do so alone. To solve this, the Wu horse borrows one Zhong horse, the Zhong horse borrows one Xia horse, and the Xia horse borrows one Wu horse. Together, they manage to carry the weight up the slope.\n\nThe question asks: What is the pulling force (\u529b\u5f15) of each type of horse?\n\n### Procedure:\nThe solution uses the method of solving simultaneous equations (\u65b9\u7a0b\u8853). The steps are as follows:\n1. Represent the pulling force of each type of horse as variables: `\u6b66\u99ac\u529b\u5f15 = x`, `\u4e2d\u99ac\u529b\u5f15 = y`, `\u4e0b\u99ac\u529b\u5f15 = z`.\n2. Formulate equations based on the problem:\n   - Equation 1: \\( x + y = 40 \\) (Wu horse and Zhong horse together carry 40 shi).\n   - Equation 2: \\( y + z = 40 \\) (Zhong horse and Xia horse together carry 40 shi).\n   - Equation 3: \\( z + x = 40 \\) (Xia horse and Wu horse together carry 40 shi).\n3.

Use the positive-negative method to solve.\n\nThe fangcheng (system of equations) procedure says:\n1. Place the coefficients for the top millet (\u4e0a\u79be), middle millet (\u4e2d\u79be), and bottom millet (\u4e0b\u79be) in rows, and place the total (\u5be6) on the right side.\n2.
