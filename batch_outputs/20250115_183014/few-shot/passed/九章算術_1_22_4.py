又有田廣七步、四分步之三，從十五步、九分步之五。問：為田幾何？
大廣田術曰：分母各乘其全，分子從之，相乘為實。分母相乘為法。實如法而一。
荅曰： a步 。

Suppose there is a field with a width of 7 bu and 3/4 bu, and a length of 15 bu and 5/9 bu.
Question: how large is the field?

The procedure for large rectangular fields says: Multiply the denominators of the fractions by their respective whole numbers, and carry along the numerators.
Multiply these to obtain the dividend.
Multiply the denominators to obtain the divisor.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to obtain the result.

Answer: *a* bu.

from fractions import Fraction

# 田廣七步、四分步之三
廣 = 7 + Fraction(3, 4)

# 從十五步、九分步之五
從 = 15 + Fraction(5, 9)

# 分母各乘其全，分子從之，相乘為實
實 = 廣 * 從

# 分母相乘為法
# (This step is implicit in the multiplication of fractions in Python)

# 實如法而一
a = 實  # The result is already in the correct form as a Fraction
