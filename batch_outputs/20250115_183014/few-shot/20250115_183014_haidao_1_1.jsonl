Let's translate the problem and procedure into Python code step by step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nThere is a mountain, and a city (\u9091) lies to the south of the mountain. A carpenter's square (\u77e9) is used to measure the city's dimensions from the mountain. The following measurements are given:\n1. The height of the vertical leg (\u53e5\u9ad8) of the carpenter's square is 3 chi 5 cun (3.5 chi).\n2. From the endpoint of the vertical leg, looking toward the northeast corner of the city, the lower leg (\u4e0b\u80a1) is entered by 1 zhang 2 chi (12 chi).\n3. A horizontal leg (\u6a6b\u53e5) is placed at the intersection of the lower leg, and from the endpoint of the vertical leg, looking toward the northwest corner of the city, the horizontal leg is entered by 5 chi.\n4. Looking toward the southeast corner of the city, the lower leg is entered by 1 zhang 8 chi (18 chi).\n5. A second carpenter's square is set up above the first, with the distance between the two squares being 4 zhang (40 chi).\n6. From the endpoint of the vertical leg of the upper square, looking toward the southeast corner of the city, the upper leg (\u4e0a\u80a1) is entered by 1 zhang 7 chi 5 cun (17.5 chi).\n\nThe task is to calculate the city's north-south length and east-west width.\n\n### Procedure:\n1. To calculate the north-south length:\n   - Multiply the vertical leg height (\u53e5\u9ad8) by the southeast corner's lower leg entry (\u6771\u5357\u9685\u5165\u4e0b\u80a1).\n   - Divide the result by the upper leg entry (\u4e0a\u80a1), then subtract the vertical leg height (\u53e5\u9ad8).

Multiply the result by the distance between the two carpenter's squares (\u77e9\u9593). This is the dividend (\u5be6).\n   - Divide the dividend by the divisor to get the city's north-south length.\n\n2.
