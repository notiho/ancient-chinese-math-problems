place 81 people at the top, 72 people in the middle, and 63 people at the bottom.\nMultiply the top position by 2, obtaining 162.\nMultiply the middle position by 3, obtaining 216.\nMultiply the bottom position by 4, obtaining 252.\nAdd these three results together, obtaining 630 as the divisor.\n\nNext, place the 6930 coins as the total.\nMultiply the total by 162 for the top position, obtaining 1122660.\nMultiply the total by 216 for the middle position, obtaining 1496880.\nMultiply the total by 252 for the bottom position, obtaining 1746360.\nEach of these results is divided by the divisor, 630, to obtain the total coins for each group.\nFinally, divide the total coins for each group by the number of people in that group to find the coins per person.\n\nAnswer: The group receiving 2 parts gets *a* coins, the group receiving 3 parts gets *b* coins, and the group receiving 4 parts gets *c* coins.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Total coins\n\u7e3d\u9322 = 6930\n\n# Group
