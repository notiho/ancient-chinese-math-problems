Multiply 14 by the **hu** (volume unit) and then multiply by the total grain volume. Divide by 89 to get the \"real volume.\"\n2. Double the \"more\" value (5 **chi**) and add the \"less\" value (1 **zhang**) to get the \"less multiplier.\" Multiply this by the \"less\" value, then multiply by 33 and divide by 89.
