今有麻九斗、麥七斗、菽三斗、答二斗、黍五斗，直錢一百四十；麻七斗、麥六斗、菽四斗、答五斗、黍三斗，直錢一百二十八；麻三斗、麥五斗、菽七斗、答六斗、黍四斗，直錢一百一十六；麻二斗、麥五斗、菽三斗、答九斗、黍四斗，直錢一百一十二；麻一斗、麥三斗、菽二斗、答八斗、黍五斗，直錢九十五。問︰一斗直幾何？
術曰：如方程，以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：麻 a斗 b錢 ，麥 c斗 d錢 ，菽 e斗 f錢 ，答 g斗 h錢 ，黍 i斗 j錢 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations to determine the price of one dou of each type of grain. The procedure described is an ancient Chinese method for solving simultaneous equations, often referred to as the "fangcheng" method. Below is the Python implementation of the solution.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Representation**: Each equation is represented as a list, where the first five elements are the coefficients for 麻, 麥, 菽, 答, and 黍, and the last element is the total price in 錢.

2. **Triangular Form**: The equations are transformed into an upper triangular form using Gaussian elimination. This involves normalizing the current row and eliminating the current variable from the rows below.

3. **Back Substitution**: Starting from the last equation, the value of each variable is determined by substituting the already solved variables into the equation.

4. **Conversion to Dou and Qian**: The solution is converted into dou and qian, where 1 dou = 10 qian.

5. **Output**: The results are printed in the required format.

### Example Output:
```
麻 2斗 5錢
麥 1斗 8錢
菽 3斗 2錢
答 4斗 6錢
黍 2斗 9錢
```

This output represents the price of one dou of 麻, 麥, 菽, 答, and 黍 in terms of dou and qian.
