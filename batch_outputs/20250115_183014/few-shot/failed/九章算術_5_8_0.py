Suppose there is a trench with the following dimensions:
- Top width: 1 zhang 6 chi 3 cun
- Bottom width: 1 zhang
- Depth: 6 chi 3 cun
- Length: 13 zhang 2 chi 1 cun

Question: What is the volume of the trench?

Answer: 10943 chi 8 cun.

Additionally:
- A worker's capacity is 871 chi.
- Adding the effort for removing soil (1/5 of the total), and accounting for sand, gravel, water, and stones (which take up more than half of the effort), the effective capacity is reduced to 232 chi and 4/15 chi.

Question: How many workers are required?

The procedure says:
- Place the worker's capacity, subtract the effort for removing soil (1/5 of the total), and subtract half the effort for sand, gravel, water, and stones. The remainder is the divisor.
- Use the trench volume as the dividend.
- Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the number of workers.

Answer: *a* workers.
