今有漆三得油四，油四和漆五。今有漆三斗，欲令分以易油，還自和餘漆。問︰出漆、得油、和漆各幾何？
術曰：假令出漆九升，不足六升。令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰：出漆 a斗 ，得油 b斗 ，和漆 c斗 ， d升 。

This problem involves a complex proportional exchange of lacquer and oil, followed by a reconciliation of the remaining lacquer. Let's break it down step by step and encode the procedure into Python.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Ratios**:
   - 3 dou of lacquer yields 4 dou of oil.
   - 4 dou of oil mixes with 5 dou of lacquer.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Start with 3 dou of lacquer.
   - Determine how much lacquer is exchanged for oil, how much oil is obtained, and how much lacquer remains for mixing.

3. **Procedure**:
   - Use the "盈不足術" (Surplus and Deficit Method) to calculate the exchange and reconciliation.

### Python Code Implementation:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 漆三得油四 (3 dou of lacquer yields 4 dou of oil)
漆出率 = 3
油得率 = 4

# 油四和漆五 (4 dou of oil mixes with 5 dou of lacquer)
油和率 = 4
漆和率 = 5

# 今有漆三斗 (Start with 3 dou of lacquer)
漆初始 = 3

# 盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下
盈 = 漆出率
不足 = 油得率

# 令維乘所出率，并以為實
實 = 漆初始 * 油得率

# 并盈、不足為法
法 = 盈 + 不足

# 實如法而一 (Divide 实 by 法 to find the lacquer exchanged for oil)
出漆 = Fraction(實, 法)

# 得油 (Calculate the oil obtained from the lacquer exchanged)
得油 = 出漆 * Fraction(油得率, 漆出率)

# 和漆 (Calculate the lacquer remaining for mixing)
和漆 = 漆初始 - 出漆

# 和漆與油混合 (Mix the remaining lacquer with oil)
混合油 = 和漆 * Fraction(油和率, 漆和率)

# Convert results to dou and sheng (1 dou = 10 sheng)
a = 出漆.numerator // 出漆.denominator  # 出漆 in dou
出漆_升 = (出漆 - a) * 10  # Remaining in sheng

b = 得油.numerator // 得油.denominator  # 得油 in dou
得油_升 = (得油 - b) * 10  # Remaining in sheng

c = 和漆.numerator // 和漆.denominator  # 和漆 in dou
和漆_升 = (和漆 - c) * 10  # Remaining in sheng

# Output results
print(f"出漆 {a}斗 {出漆_升}升")
print(f"得油 {b}斗 {得油_升}升")
print(f"和漆 {c}斗 {和漆_升}升")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Exchange Calculation**:
   - The lacquer exchanged for oil is calculated using the surplus and deficit method (`盈不足術`).
   - The oil obtained is proportional to the lacquer exchanged.

2. **Remaining Lacquer**:
   - The lacquer remaining after the exchange is used for mixing with oil.

3. **Mixing**:
   - The remaining lacquer is mixed with oil in the given ratio (4 dou of oil mixes with 5 dou of lacquer).

4. **Conversion**:
   - Results are converted into dou and sheng for proper representation.

---

### Final Answer:
The output will provide the following:
- `a斗` and `d升`: The lacquer exchanged for oil.
- `b斗` and `d升`: The oil obtained.
- `c斗` and `d升`: The lacquer remaining for mixing.
