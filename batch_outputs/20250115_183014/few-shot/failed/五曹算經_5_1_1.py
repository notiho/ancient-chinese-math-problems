今有五百六十五户，共責絲八石五斤三两八銖。問：户出絲㡬何？
術曰：列絲八石五斤三两八銖，以四乘八石得三十二鈞；以三十斤乘之、納五斤，得九百六十五斤；以十六两乘之、納三两，得一萬五千四百四十三两；以二十四銖乘之、納八銖，得三十七萬六百四十銖。以五百六十五户除之，得一户六百五十六銖；以二十四銖除之，得二十七两奇八銖；以十六除之即得。

Suppose there are 565 households, and together they owe 8 shi, 5 jin, 3 liang, and 8 zhu of silk.
Question: how much silk does each household owe?

The procedure says: 
List the silk as 8 shi, 5 jin, 3 liang, and 8 zhu.
Multiply the 8 shi by 4 to get 32 jun.
Multiply this by 30 jin and add 5 jin, obtaining 965 jin.
Multiply this by 16 liang and add 3 liang, obtaining 15,443 liang.
Multiply this by 24 zhu and add 8 zhu, obtaining 370,640 zhu.
Divide this by 565 households, obtaining 656 zhu per household.
Divide this by 24 zhu, obtaining 27 liang and 8 zhu remaining.
Divide this by 16 liang to obtain the final result.

The answer says: *a* jin, *b* liang, *c* zhu.
