今有上禾五秉，損實一斗一升，當下禾七秉。上禾七秉，損實二斗五升，當下禾五秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾五秉正，下禾七秉負，損實一斗一升正。次置上禾七秉正，下禾五秉負，損實二斗五升正。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：上禾 a秉 b升 ，下禾 c秉 d升 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using ancient Chinese methods, which resemble modern elimination techniques. Let's translate the problem and solution into Python code step by step.

### Problem Explanation:
We are given two conditions:
1. 5 bundles of upper millet (上禾) and 7 bundles of lower millet (下禾) result in a loss of 1 dou and 1 sheng (1斗1升).
2. 7 bundles of upper millet (上禾) and 5 bundles of lower millet (下禾) result in a loss of 2 dou and 5 sheng (2斗5升).

We need to find the actual content of one bundle of upper millet (上禾) and one bundle of lower millet (下禾).

### Procedure:
The procedure involves setting up two equations and solving them using elimination:
1. Represent the problem as a system of equations.
2. Use elimination to solve for the values of one bundle of upper millet and one bundle of lower millet.

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Convert dou and sheng to a single unit (sheng)
def convert_to_sheng(dou, sheng):
    return dou * 10 + sheng

# Problem setup
# First condition: 5上禾 - 7下禾 = 1斗1升
上禾1 = 5
下禾1 = -7
損實1 = convert_to_sheng(1, 1)  # 1斗1升 = 11升

# Second condition: 7上禾 - 5下禾 = 2斗5升
上禾2 = 7
下禾2 = -5
損實2 = convert_to_sheng(2, 5)  # 2斗5升 = 25升

# Elimination process
# Multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 5 to align coefficients of 上禾
eq1_multiplied = (上禾1 * 7, 下禾1 * 7, 損實1 * 7)
eq2_multiplied = (上禾2 * 5, 下禾2 * 5, 損實2 * 5)

# Subtract the two equations to eliminate 上禾
下禾_coeff = eq1_multiplied[1] - eq2_multiplied[1]
損實_diff = eq1_multiplied[2] - eq2_multiplied[2]

# Solve for 下禾 (one bundle of lower millet)
下禾實 = Fraction(損實_diff, 下禾_coeff)

# Substitute 下禾實 back into the first equation to solve for 上禾
上禾實 = Fraction(損實1 - (下禾1 * 下禾實), 上禾1)

# Convert results back to dou and sheng
def convert_to_dou_sheng(value):
    dou = value // 10
    sheng = value % 10
    return int(dou), int(sheng)

a_dou, a_sheng = convert_to_dou_sheng(上禾實)
c_dou, c_sheng = convert_to_dou_sheng(下禾實)

# Final answer
print(f"上禾 {a_dou}斗 {a_sheng}升 ，下禾 {c_dou}斗 {c_sheng}升 。")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Conversion to Sheng**: The problem uses two units, dou (斗) and sheng (升). Since 1 dou = 10 sheng, we convert everything to sheng for easier calculations.
2. **System of Equations**: The two conditions are represented as linear equations:
   - \( 5x - 7y = 11 \)
   - \( 7x - 5y = 25 \)
3. **Elimination**: We eliminate one variable (上禾 or 下禾) by aligning coefficients and subtracting the equations.
4. **Solve for Variables**: After elimination, we solve for one variable and substitute it back to find the other.
5. **Convert Back to Dou and Sheng**: The results are converted back to dou and sheng for the final answer.

---

### Final Output:
The program will output the content of one bundle of upper millet (上禾) and one bundle of lower millet (下禾) in dou and sheng.
