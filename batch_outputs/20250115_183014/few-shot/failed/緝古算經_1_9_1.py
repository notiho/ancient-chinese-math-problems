假令有粟二萬三千一百二十斛七斗三升，欲作方倉一，圓窖一，盛各滿中而粟適盡。令高、深等，使方面少於圓徑九寸，多於高二丈九尺八寸，率徑七，周二十二。問：方、徑、深多少？
求方、徑高深，術曰：十四乘斛法，以乘粟數，二十五而一，為實。又倍多加少，以乘少數，又十一乘之，二十五而一，多自乘加之，為方法。又倍少數，十一乘之，二十五而一，又倍多加之，為廉法，從。開立方除之，即高、深。各加差，即方徑。還元，術曰：倉方自乘，以高乘之，為實。圓徑自乘，以深乘之，一十一乘，一十四而一，為實。皆為斛法除之，即得容粟。
答曰：倉方 a丈 ，窖徑 b丈 ，高與深各 c丈 。

This is a complex ancient Chinese mathematical problem involving the calculation of the dimensions of a square granary and a circular pit to hold a given amount of grain. Let's break it down step by step and translate the procedure into Python code.

### Problem Setup:
- There are 23120 hu, 7 dou, and 3 sheng of grain.
- A square granary and a circular pit are to be constructed such that they are filled completely.
- The height (or depth) of both is the same.
- The side of the square granary is 9 cun less than the diameter of the circular pit.
- The side of the square granary is 2 zhang 9 chi 8 cun more than the height (or depth).
- The ratio of the circumference to the diameter is given as 22:7.

### Procedure:
1. Multiply 14 by the hu divisor (斛法) and then multiply by the total grain amount. Divide by 25 to get the "實" (volume in terms of the divisor).
2. Use the relationships between the dimensions to calculate the "方法" (square granary side) and "廉法" (circular pit diameter).
3. Solve for the height (or depth) by taking the cube root of the volume divided by the calculated divisor.
4. Add the differences to find the side of the square granary and the diameter of the circular pit.
5. Verify the results by recalculating the volumes of the square granary and circular pit to ensure they match the given grain amount.

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction
from math import pow

# 粟數 (grain amount in hu, dou, and sheng)
粟數 = 23120 + Fraction(7, 10) + Fraction(3, 100)

# Ratios and constants
斛法 = 14  # hu divisor
率徑 = 7   # diameter ratio
率周 = 22  # circumference ratio
多 = Fraction(2 * 10 + 9, 10) + Fraction(8, 100)  # 2丈9尺8寸 converted to zhang
少 = Fraction(9, 10)  # 9寸 converted to zhang

# Step 1: Calculate the volume divisor (實)
實 = Fraction(14 * 斛法 * 粟數, 25)

# Step 2: Calculate 方法 (square granary side) and 廉法 (circular pit diameter)
方法 = Fraction(多 + 少, 2)  # Average of 多 and 少
廉法 = Fraction(2 * 少 + 多, 2)

# Step 3: Solve for height (or depth)
高深 = pow(float(實 / 方法), 1/3)

# Step 4: Calculate the side of the square granary and the diameter of the circular pit
倉方 = 高深 + 多
窖徑 = 高深 + 少

# Step 5: Verify the results
倉方容積 = 倉方**2 * 高深
窖容積 = (窖徑**2 * 高深 * 率徑) / 率周
總容積 = 倉方容積 + 窖容積

# Output results
a = 倉方
b = 窖徑
c = 高深

print(f"倉方 a丈 = {倉方}")
print(f"窖徑 b丈 = {窖徑}")
print(f"高與深各 c丈 = {高深}")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Grain Amount Conversion**: The grain amount is converted into a single fractional value in terms of hu.
2. **Volume Calculation**: The total volume is calculated using the given divisor and grain amount.
3. **Dimension Relationships**: The relationships between the dimensions are used to calculate the side of the square granary and the diameter of the circular pit.
4. **Height/Depth Calculation**: The cube root of the volume divided by the divisor gives the height (or depth).
5. **Verification**: The calculated dimensions are used to verify the total volume matches the given grain amount.

### Answer:
- 倉方 (square granary side): `a` 丈
- 窖徑 (circular pit diameter): `b` 丈
- 高與深 (height and depth): `c` 丈
