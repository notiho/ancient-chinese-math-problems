今有甲禾二秉、乙禾三秉、丙禾四秉，重皆過於石。甲二重如乙一，乙三重如丙一，丙四重如甲一。問︰甲、乙、丙禾一秉各重幾何？
術曰：如方程，置重過於石之物為負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：甲禾 a秉 重 b石 ，乙禾 c秉 重 d石 ，丙禾 e秉 重 f石 。

This problem involves solving a system of equations using ancient Chinese "fangcheng" (方程) methods, which is equivalent to solving simultaneous linear equations. Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.

### Problem Setup:
- There are three types of grain: A (甲禾), B (乙禾), and C (丙禾).
- Their respective quantities are:
  - A: 2秉
  - B: 3秉
  - C: 4秉
- The relationships between their weights are:
  - 2 weights of A = 1 weight of B
  - 3 weights of B = 1 weight of C
  - 4 weights of C = 1 weight of A
- The total weight of all grains exceeds 1石 (10斗).

We aim to find the weight of 1秉 of each type of grain.

---

### Procedure:
The ancient "fangcheng" method is described as follows:
1. Set up the equations based on the relationships.
2. Use elimination and substitution to solve for the unknowns.
3. Normalize the results to find the weight of 1秉 for each type of grain.

### Python Code Implementation:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Step 1: Define the relationships and quantities
甲禾_秉 = 2  # A has 2 bundles
乙禾_秉 = 3  # B has 3 bundles
丙禾_秉 = 4  # C has 4 bundles

# Step 2: Define the weight relationships
# 2 weights of A = 1 weight of B -> 2A = B -> A = B / 2
# 3 weights of B = 1 weight of C -> 3B = C -> B = C / 3
# 4 weights of C = 1 weight of A -> 4C = A -> C = A / 4

# Step 3: Express all weights in terms of one variable (e.g., A)
# From the relationships:
# B = 2A
# C = 3B = 3(2A) = 6A

# Step 4: Total weight equation
# Total weight = 甲禾_秉 * A + 乙禾_秉 * B + 丙禾_秉 * C
# Total weight = 2A + 3(2A) + 4(6A) = 2A + 6A + 24A = 32A

# Step 5: Solve for A
# Total weight exceeds 1石 (10斗), so:
total_weight = 10  # 1石 = 10斗
A = Fraction(total_weight, 32)  # A = total_weight / 32

# Step 6: Calculate weights of B and C
B = 2 * A
C = 6 * A

# Step 7: Calculate the total weight of each type of grain
甲禾_重 = 甲禾_秉 * A
乙禾_重 = 乙禾_秉 * B
丙禾_重 = 丙禾_秉 * C

# Final Results
a = 甲禾_秉
b = 甲禾_重
c = 乙禾_秉
d = 乙禾_重
e = 丙禾_秉
f = 丙禾_重

print(f"甲禾 {a}秉 重 {b}石")
print(f"乙禾 {c}秉 重 {d}石")
print(f"丙禾 {e}秉 重 {f}石")


"""

### Explanation of Results:
- `a`, `b`: The number of bundles and total weight of A (甲禾).
- `c`, `d`: The number of bundles and total weight of B (乙禾).
- `e`, `f`: The number of bundles and total weight of C (丙禾).

This code calculates the weight of 1秉 for each type of grain and the total weight for the given quantities.
