Suppose there is a trench with the following dimensions:
- Top width: 1 zhang 6 chi 3 cun
- Bottom width: 1 zhang
- Depth: 6 chi 3 cun
- Length: 13 zhang 2 chi 1 cun

Question: What is the volume of the trench?

Answer: 10,943 chi 8 cun.

Additionally:
- The standard work capacity of one person is 871 chi.
- Including the effort for removing earth, add 1/5 of the work.
- For sand, gravel, water, and stone, the effort is increased by more than half.
- The adjusted work capacity is 232 chi and 4/15 chi.

Question: How many workers are required?

The procedure says: Place the standard work capacity of one person, subtract the 1/5 effort for removing earth, and subtract half the effort for sand, gravel, water, and stone. The remainder is the divisor.
Take the trench volume in chi as the dividend.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the number of workers required.

Answer: *a* workers.
