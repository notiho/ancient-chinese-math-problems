假令有句弦相乘冪一千三百三十七二十分之一，弦多股一、十分之一。問：股多少？
術曰：冪自乘，倍多而一，為立冪。又多再自乘，半之，減立冪，余為實。又多數自乘，倍之，為方法。又置多數，五之，二而一，為廉法，從。開立方除之，即股。案：此術脫簡既多，法亦煩擾，宜雲冪自乘，多數而一，所得四之，為實。多為廉法，從。立方開之，得減差，半之，即股。
答曰： a 。

This problem involves solving for the "leg" (股) of a right triangle given the hypotenuse (弦), the difference between the hypotenuse and the leg (多), and the square of the hypotenuse (冪). The problem is complex and involves cubic roots and simplifications. Let's translate the procedure into Python code step by step.

### Problem Restatement:
Suppose the product of the hypotenuse and the leg (冪) is \(1337 \frac{1}{20}\). The hypotenuse exceeds the leg by \(1 \frac{1}{10}\). Question: what is the leg (股)?

### Procedure:
The procedure involves several steps, but the simplified version is used here:
1. Multiply the square of the hypotenuse (冪) by the difference (多數) and divide by 4 to get the "實".
2. Use the difference (多數) as the "廉法".
3. Take the cube root of the result and halve it to find the leg (股).

### Code Implementation:


"""


from fractions import Fraction
from math import pow

# 冪一千三百三十七二十分之一
冪 = Fraction(1337, 1) + Fraction(1, 20)

# 弦多股一、十分之一
多數 = Fraction(1, 1) + Fraction(1, 10)

# 冪自乘，多數而一，所得四之，為實
實 = (冪 * 多數) / 4

# 多為廉法
廉法 = 多數

# 開立方除之，即股
股 = Fraction(pow(實, 1/3), 2)

# Answer
a = 股


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **冪 and 多數**: These are given as fractions, so we use the `Fraction` class to represent them accurately.
2. **實 Calculation**: Multiply the square of the hypotenuse (冪) by the difference (多數) and divide by 4.
3. **廉法**: The difference (多數) is used as the divisor for the cube root.
4. **Cube Root and Halving**: Take the cube root of `實` and halve it to find the leg (股).

### Final Answer:
The variable `a` contains the value of the leg (股).
