今有上禾三秉，益實六斗，當下禾十秉。下禾五秉，益實一斗，當上禾二秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾三秉正，下禾一十秉負，益實六斗負。次置上禾二秉負，下禾五秉正，益實一斗負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：上禾 a秉 實 b斗 ，下禾 c秉 實 d斗 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using ancient Chinese methods, which is essentially equivalent to solving simultaneous equations. Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.

### Problem Setup:
We are given two relationships:
1. 3 bundles of upper millet (上禾) plus 6 dou of grain equals 10 bundles of lower millet (下禾).
2. 5 bundles of lower millet plus 1 dou of grain equals 2 bundles of upper millet.

We need to find the amount of grain (实) in one bundle of upper millet and one bundle of lower millet.

### Procedure:
The ancient Chinese method for solving this is equivalent to Gaussian elimination. Here's the step-by-step translation into Python:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Define the coefficients of the equations
# Equation 1: 3上禾 - 10下禾 - 6 = 0
上禾1 = 3
下禾1 = -10
常數1 = -6

# Equation 2: -2上禾 + 5下禾 - 1 = 0
上禾2 = -2
下禾2 = 5
常數2 = -1

# Step 1: Eliminate one variable (e.g., 上禾) using the equations
# Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to align 上禾 coefficients
上禾消去1 = 2 * 上禾1
下禾消去1 = 2 * 下禾1
常數消去1 = 2 * 常數1

上禾消去2 = 3 * 上禾2
下禾消去2 = 3 * 下禾2
常數消去2 = 3 * 常數2

# Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate 上禾
下禾係數 = 下禾消去1 - 下禾消去2
常數係數 = 常數消去1 - 常數消去2

# Step 2: Solve for 下禾 (grain in one bundle of lower millet)
下禾實 = Fraction(-常數係數, 下禾係數)

# Step 3: Substitute 下禾實 back into one of the original equations to solve for 上禾
# Using the first equation: 3上禾 - 10下禾 - 6 = 0
上禾實 = Fraction(-(下禾1 * 下禾實 + 常數1), 上禾1)

# Results
a = 1  # One bundle of upper millet
b = 上禾實  # Grain in one bundle of upper millet
c = 1  # One bundle of lower millet
d = 下禾實  # Grain in one bundle of lower millet

print(f"上禾 {a}秉 实 {b}斗 ，下禾 {c}秉 实 {d}斗 。")


"""


### Explanation:
1. The equations are set up based on the problem statement.
2. Gaussian elimination is used to eliminate one variable (上禾) and solve for the other (下禾).
3. The solution for 下禾 is substituted back into one of the original equations to solve for 上禾.
4. The results are expressed as fractions to maintain precision.

### Answer:
The output will provide the amount of grain (实) in one bundle of upper millet (上禾) and one bundle of lower millet (下禾).
