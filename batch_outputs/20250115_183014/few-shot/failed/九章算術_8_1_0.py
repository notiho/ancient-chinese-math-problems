今有上禾七秉，損實一斗，益之下禾二秉，而實一十斗。下禾八秉，益實一斗與上禾二秉，而實一十斗。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程。損之曰益，益之曰損。損實一斗者，其實過一十斗也。益實一斗者，其實不滿一十斗也。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：上禾 a秉 實 b斗 ，下禾 c秉 實 d斗 。

This problem involves solving a system of equations to determine the yield of one sheaf of upper and lower millet. Let's break it down step by step and encode the solution in Python.

### Problem Explanation:
We are given two scenarios:
1. Seven sheaves of upper millet lose one dou of grain, and when combined with two sheaves of lower millet, the total yield is 10 dou.
2. Eight sheaves of lower millet gain one dou of grain, and when combined with two sheaves of upper millet, the total yield is 10 dou.

We need to determine the yield of one sheaf of upper millet (`a`) and one sheaf of lower millet (`b`).

### Procedure:
The procedure involves setting up equations based on the given conditions and solving them step by step using elimination and substitution.

#### Equations:
1. \( 7a - 1 + 2b = 10 \) (from the first condition)
2. \( 8b + 1 + 2a = 10 \) (from the second condition)

Simplify these:
1. \( 7a + 2b = 11 \)
2. \( 2a + 8b = 9 \)

We solve this system of linear equations to find \( a \) (yield of one sheaf of upper millet) and \( b \) (yield of one sheaf of lower millet).

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Coefficients of the equations
# Equation 1: 7a + 2b = 11
# Equation 2: 2a + 8b = 9

# Step 1: Eliminate `a` by multiplying equations to align coefficients of `a`
# Multiply Equation 1 by 2 and Equation 2 by 7
eq1_a = 7 * 2  # Coefficient of `a` in Equation 1 after scaling
eq1_b = 2 * 2  # Coefficient of `b` in Equation 1 after scaling
eq1_c = 11 * 2  # Constant term in Equation 1 after scaling

eq2_a = 2 * 7  # Coefficient of `a` in Equation 2 after scaling
eq2_b = 8 * 7  # Coefficient of `b` in Equation 2 after scaling
eq2_c = 9 * 7  # Constant term in Equation 2 after scaling

# Subtract scaled Equation 2 from scaled Equation 1 to eliminate `a`
b_coefficient = eq1_b - eq2_b
b_constant = eq1_c - eq2_c

# Solve for `b`
b = Fraction(b_constant, b_coefficient)

# Step 2: Substitute `b` back into one of the original equations to solve for `a`
# Using Equation 1: 7a + 2b = 11
a_coefficient = 7
a_constant = 11 - (2 * b)

# Solve for `a`
a = Fraction(a_constant, a_coefficient)

# Results
c = 1  # Each sheaf is 1 unit
d = b  # Yield of one sheaf of lower millet

print(f"上禾 {c}秉 實 {a}斗 ，下禾 {c}秉 實 {d}斗 。")


"""


---

### Explanation of the Code:
1. The equations are scaled to align the coefficients of \( a \), allowing elimination of \( a \) to solve for \( b \).
2. Once \( b \) is found, it is substituted back into one of the original equations to solve for \( a \).
3. The results are expressed in terms of \( a \) (yield of one sheaf of upper millet) and \( b \) (yield of one sheaf of lower millet).

### Answer:
The output will provide the yield of one sheaf of upper millet (`a`) and one sheaf of lower millet (`b`) in dou.
