今有漆三得油四，油四和漆五。今有漆三斗，欲令分以易油，還自和餘漆。問︰出漆、得油、和漆各幾何？
術曰：假令出漆九升，不足六升。令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰：出漆 a斗 ，得油 b斗 ，和漆 c斗 ， d升 。

This problem involves a complex exchange and reconciliation of lacquer (漆) and oil (油). Let's carefully translate the procedure into Python code step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given**:
   - 3 dou of lacquer yields 4 dou of oil.
   - 4 dou of oil mixes with 5 dou of lacquer.
   - Start with 3 dou of lacquer.

2. **Question**:
   - How much lacquer is exchanged for oil?
   - How much oil is obtained?
   - How much lacquer remains after mixing?

3. **Procedure**:
   - Use the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method) to calculate the exchange and reconciliation.

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 漆三得油四 (3 dou of lacquer yields 4 dou of oil)
漆出率 = Fraction(3)  # Lacquer output rate
油得率 = Fraction(4)  # Oil yield rate

# 油四和漆五 (4 dou of oil mixes with 5 dou of lacquer)
油和率 = Fraction(4)  # Oil mixing rate
漆和率 = Fraction(5)  # Lacquer mixing rate

# 今有漆三斗 (Start with 3 dou of lacquer)
漆初始 = Fraction(3)

# Step 1: Calculate how much lacquer is exchanged for oil
# 假令出漆九升，不足六升 (Assume 9 sheng of lacquer is exchanged, leaving a deficiency of 6 sheng)
假出漆 = Fraction(9, 10)  # 9 sheng = 9/10 dou
不足 = Fraction(6, 10)    # 6 sheng = 6/10 dou

# 盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下
盈 = 漆出率
不足 = 不足

# 令維乘所出率，并以為實
實 = 假出漆 * 漆出率

# 并盈、不足為法
法 = 盈 + 不足

# 實如法而一
出漆 = 實 / 法

# Step 2: Calculate how much oil is obtained
# 得油 = 出漆 * (油得率 / 漆出率)
得油 = 出漆 * (油得率 / 漆出率)

# Step 3: Calculate how much lacquer remains after mixing
# 和漆 = 漆初始 - 出漆 + (得油 * (漆和率 / 油和率))
和漆 = 漆初始 - 出漆 + (得油 * (漆和率 / 油和率))

# Convert 和漆 into dou and sheng
和漆斗 = int(和漆)  # Whole dou
和漆升 = (和漆 - 和漆斗) * 10  # Remaining sheng

# Final Results
a = 出漆  # Lacquer exchanged
b = 得油  # Oil obtained
c = 和漆斗  # Remaining lacquer in dou
d = 和漆升  # Remaining lacquer in sheng

# Output results
a, b, c, d

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Exchange Calculation**:
   - Use the given rates (漆出率 and 油得率) to calculate how much lacquer is exchanged for oil.
   - Apply the "盈不足術" method to adjust for any excess or deficiency.

2. **Oil Obtained**:
   - Use the ratio of lacquer to oil (漆出率 to 油得率) to determine how much oil is obtained from the exchanged lacquer.

3. **Remaining Lacquer**:
   - Subtract the lacquer exchanged from the initial amount.
   - Add back the lacquer that mixes with the obtained oil (using the mixing ratio, 漆和率 to 油和率).

4. **Output**:
   - The results are presented in dou (斗) and sheng (升), as required.

### Final Answer:
- `a` = Lacquer exchanged (in dou).
- `b` = Oil obtained (in dou).
- `c` = Remaining lacquer (in dou).
- `d` = Remaining lacquer (in sheng).
