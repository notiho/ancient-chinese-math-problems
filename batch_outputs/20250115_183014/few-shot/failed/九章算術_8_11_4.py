今有武馬一匹，中馬二匹，下馬三匹，皆載四十石至阪，皆不能上。武馬借中馬一匹，中馬借下馬一匹，下馬借武馬一匹，乃皆上。問︰武、中、下馬一匹各力引幾何？
術曰：如方程各置所借，以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：武馬 a匹 力引 b石 ，中馬 c匹 力引 d石 ，下馬 e匹 力引 f石 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using ancient Chinese methods, which resemble Gaussian elimination. Let's break it down step by step and implement the solution in Python.

### Problem Description
We have three types of horses: Wu horse (武馬), Zhong horse (中馬), and Xia horse (下馬). Each horse type has a specific pulling strength, but initially, none of them can pull a load of 40 shi (石) up a slope. By borrowing horses from each other, they manage to pull the load. The task is to determine the pulling strength of each type of horse.

### Procedure
The procedure involves setting up equations based on the borrowing and solving them using elimination techniques. Here's the step-by-step implementation:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Step 1: Define the borrowing relationships and initial equations
# 武馬借中馬一匹，中馬借下馬一匹，下馬借武馬一匹
# Let x = 武馬 pulling strength, y = 中馬 pulling strength, z = 下馬 pulling strength
# Equations based on the problem:
# 武馬 + 中馬 = 40
# 中馬 + 下馬 = 40
# 下馬 + 武馬 = 40

# Step 2: Represent the equations in matrix form
# Coefficients of the equations:
# x + y + 0z = 40
# 0x + y + z = 40
# x + 0y + z = 40

# Matrix representation:
# | 1   1   0 |   | x |   =   | 40 |
# | 0   1   1 |   | y |   =   | 40 |
# | 1   0   1 |   | z |   =   | 40 |

# Step 3: Solve the system of equations using elimination
# Initialize the coefficients and constants
A = [
    [1, 1, 0],  # Coefficients of the first equation
    [0, 1, 1],  # Coefficients of the second equation
    [1, 0, 1]   # Coefficients of the third equation
]
B = [40, 40, 40]  # Constants on the right-hand side

# Elimination process
# Normalize the first row
A[0] = [Fraction(A[0][i], A[0][0]) for i in range(3)]
B[0] = Fraction(B[0], A[0][0])

# Eliminate x from the second and third rows
for i in range(1, 3):
    factor = A[i][0]
    A[i] = [A[i][j] - factor * A[0][j] for j in range(3)]
    B[i] = B[i] - factor * B[0]

# Normalize the second row
A[1] = [Fraction(A[1][i], A[1][1]) for i in range(3)]
B[1] = Fraction(B[1], A[1][1])

# Eliminate y from the third row
factor = A[2][1]
A[2] = [A[2][j] - factor * A[1][j] for j in range(3)]
B[2] = B[2] - factor * B[1]

# Normalize the third row
A[2] = [Fraction(A[2][i], A[2][2]) for i in range(3)]
B[2] = Fraction(B[2], A[2][2])

# Back-substitution to find x, y, z
z = B[2]
y = B[1] - A[1][2] * z
x = B[0] - A[0][1] * y - A[0][2] * z

# Step 4: Output the results
a, b = 1, x  # 武馬: 1匹, pulling strength b石
c, d = 1, y  # 中馬: 1匹, pulling strength d石
e, f = 1, z  # 下馬: 1匹, pulling strength f石

print(f"武馬 {a}匹 力引 {b}石")
print(f"中馬 {c}匹 力引 {d}石")
print(f"下馬 {e}匹 力引 {f}石")

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Matrix Representation**: The problem is translated into a system of linear equations, which is represented in matrix form.
2. **Gaussian Elimination**: The system is solved step by step using elimination, normalizing rows and eliminating variables to isolate each unknown.
3. **Back-Substitution**: After isolating the variables, their values are calculated using back-substitution.
4. **Output**: The pulling strength of each type of horse is displayed.

### Answer
The output will be:
```
武馬 1匹 力引 20石
中馬 1匹 力引 20石
下馬 1匹 力引 20石
```
