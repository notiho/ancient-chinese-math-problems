今有甲禾二秉、乙禾三秉、丙禾四秉，重皆過於石。甲二重如乙一，乙三重如丙一，丙四重如甲一。問︰甲、乙、丙禾一秉各重幾何？
術曰：如方程，置重過於石之物為負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：甲禾 a秉 重 b石 ，乙禾 c秉 重 d石 ，丙禾 e秉 重 f石 。

This problem involves solving a system of equations to determine the weight of one bundle of each type of grain (甲禾, 乙禾, 丙禾). The problem is described using ancient Chinese "方程術" (method of solving equations), which is essentially a method for solving linear equations.

Here is the solution step-by-step, translated into Python code:

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
甲禾_秉數 = 2  # 甲禾 has 2 bundles
乙禾_秉數 = 3  # 乙禾 has 3 bundles
丙禾_秉數 = 4  # 丙禾 has 4 bundles

# Relationships between weights
# 甲禾 2重如乙禾 1重
甲禾_重比 = Fraction(1, 2)  # Weight of one 甲禾 bundle is half of one 乙禾 bundle
# 乙禾 3重如丙禾 1重
乙禾_重比 = Fraction(1, 3)  # Weight of one 乙禾 bundle is one-third of one 丙禾 bundle
# 丙禾 4重如甲禾 1重
丙禾_重比 = Fraction(1, 4)  # Weight of one 丙禾 bundle is one-fourth of one 甲禾 bundle

# Total weight exceeds 1 石 (10 斗)
總重 = 39  # Total weight in dou (1 石 = 10 斗)

# Step 1: Express weights of each type of grain in terms of one variable
# Let 丙禾_重 (weight of one 丙禾 bundle) = x
丙禾_重 = Fraction(1)  # Assume 丙禾_重 = x

# Weight of one 乙禾 bundle
乙禾_重 = 丙禾_重 * 丙禾_重比  # 丙禾_重比 = 1/4
乙禾_重 = 丙禾_重 * Fraction(1, 4)

# Weight of one 甲禾 bundle
甲禾_重 = 乙禾_重 * 乙禾_重比  # 乙禾_重比 = 1/3
甲禾_重 = 乙禾_重 * Fraction(1, 3)

# Step 2: Calculate total weight
# Total weight = (甲禾_秉數 * 甲禾_重) + (乙禾_秉數 * 乙禾_重) + (丙禾_秉數 * 丙禾_重)
總重_計算 = (甲禾_秉數 * 甲禾_重) + (乙禾_秉數 * 乙禾_重) + (丙禾_秉數 * 丙禾_重)

# Step 3: Solve for 丙禾_重
# Set 總重_計算 = 總重
丙禾_重 = Fraction(總重, 總重_計算.denominator)  # Solve for 丙禾_重

# Step 4: Calculate weights of 甲禾 and 乙禾
甲禾_重 = 丙禾_重 * 丙禾_重比 * 乙禾_重比  # Weight of one 甲禾 bundle
乙禾_重 = 丙禾_重 * 丙禾_重比  # Weight of one 乙禾 bundle

# Step 5: Calculate total weights for each type of grain
甲禾_總重 = 甲禾_秉數 * 甲禾_重
乙禾_總重 = 乙禾_秉數 * 乙禾_重
丙禾_總重 = 丙禾_秉數 * 丙禾_重

# Final results
a = 甲禾_秉數
b = 甲禾_總重
c = 乙禾_秉數
d = 乙禾_總重
e = 丙禾_秉數
f = 丙禾_總重

print(f"甲禾 {a}秉 重 {b}石")
print(f"乙禾 {c}秉 重 {d}石")
print(f"丙禾 {e}秉 重 {f}石")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Relationships Between Weights**: The problem provides ratios between the weights of the grains. These are converted into fractions for precise calculations.
2. **Expressing Weights**: The weight of each type of grain is expressed in terms of one variable (`丙禾_重`).
3. **Total Weight Equation**: The total weight is calculated as the sum of the weights of all bundles.
4. **Solving for the Variable**: The variable `丙禾_重` is solved using the total weight equation.
5. **Calculating Individual Weights**: Once `丙禾_重` is known, the weights of `甲禾` and `乙禾` are calculated using the given ratios.
6. **Final Results**: The total weights for each type of grain are calculated and displayed.

### Output:
The output will display the number of bundles and total weight (in 石) for each type of grain.
