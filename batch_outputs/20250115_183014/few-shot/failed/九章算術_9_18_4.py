今有邑方不知大小，各中開門。出北門三十步有木，出西門七百五十步見木。問︰邑方幾何？
術曰：令兩出門步數相乘，因而四之，為實。開方除之，即得邑方。
荅曰： a里 。

Suppose there is a square city whose size is unknown. Each side of the city has a gate in the middle.
Walking 30 bu north from the north gate, there is a tree.
Walking 750 bu west from the west gate, there is another tree.
Question: what is the side length of the square city?

The procedure says: Multiply the distances walked from the two gates, then multiply the result by 4 to get the dividend.
Take the square root of the dividend to obtain the side length of the city.

Answer: *a* li.
