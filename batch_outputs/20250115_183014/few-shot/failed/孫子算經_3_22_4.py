The problem and procedure provided are somewhat ambiguous and seem to involve a specific ancient Chinese algorithm for calculating the total number of items in a bundle based on its external circumference. The exact interpretation of the procedure ("術") is unclear without additional context or clarification. However, I will attempt to interpret and encode the procedure as best as possible based on the description.

---

### Problem Interpretation:
Suppose there is a square bundle of items, with its external circumference given. Each side of the square contains 32 items. The question asks for the total number of items in the bundle.

The procedure describes an algorithm involving subtraction, addition, and positional manipulation, but the exact meaning of "重置二位左位減八餘加右位" is unclear. I will attempt to interpret it step by step.

---

### Attempted Python Code:


"""


# 方物一束外周，一市有三十二枚
外周 = 32  # Each side of the square has 32 items

# Initialize variables
積 = 0  # Total number of items
位 = 外周  # Start with the given circumference

# 術曰：重置二位左位減八餘加右位，至盡虛加一，即得
while 位 > 0:
    # Left position minus 8
    左位 = 位 - 8
    
    # Add the right position (assume "right position" means the remainder after subtraction)
    右位 = 位 % 10  # Assuming "right position" refers to the last digit
    積 += 左位 + 右位
    
    # Update 位 for the next iteration
    位 = 左位 // 10  # Move to the next "position"

# 至盡虛加一
積 += 1  # Add 1 when the process ends

# Answer
a = 積


"""


---

### Explanation of the Code:
1. The procedure seems to involve repeatedly subtracting 8 from the "left position" of the given number (interpreted as the external circumference or a related value).
2. The "right position" is interpreted as the remainder after subtraction or the last digit of the current value.
3. The process continues until the value is reduced to 0, at which point 1 is added to the total.
4. The total (`積`) is the answer.

---

### Note:
The exact meaning of the procedure is unclear, and this is an attempt to interpret it based on the provided description. If you have additional context or clarification, I can refine the solution further.
