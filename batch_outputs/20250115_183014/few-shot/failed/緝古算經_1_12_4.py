假令有粟五千一百四十石，欲作方窖、圓窖各一，令口小底大，方面於圓徑等，兩深亦同，其深少於下方七尺，多於上方一丈四尺，盛各滿中而粟適盡。問：方、徑、深各多少？
術曰：以四十二乘斛法，以乘粟，七十五而一，為方亭積。令方差自乘，三而一，為隅陽冪，以截多乘之，減積，余為實。以多乘差，加冪，為方法。多加差，為廉法，從。開立方除之，即上方。加差，即合所問。
答曰：上方徑各 a尺 ，下方徑各 b丈 ，深各 c丈 。

This problem is quite complex and involves advanced ancient Chinese mathematical techniques for solving cubic equations. The procedure describes a method for determining the dimensions of a square-based and circular-based granary, given specific conditions about their dimensions and volume. Let's translate this into Python code step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given**:
   - Total millet: 5140 石.
   - Two granaries: one square-based and one circular-based.
   - The base of the square granary and the diameter of the circular granary are equal.
   - The depth of both granaries is the same.
   - The depth is 7 尺 less than the lower base and 1 丈 4 尺 more than the upper base.
   - Both granaries are filled to capacity, and the millet is exactly used up.

2. **Procedure**:
   - Use the formula for volume to calculate the dimensions of the granaries.
   - Solve a cubic equation to find the dimensions.

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction
from math import pow

# Given data
粟 = 5140  # Total millet in 石
斛法 = 42  # Conversion factor for 石 to cubic 尺
七十五 = 75  # Factor for converting to 方亭積
深差 = Fraction(7, 10)  # Depth difference in 丈 (7 尺 = 7/10 丈)
多差 = Fraction(14, 10)  # Depth difference in 丈 (1 丈 4 尺 = 14/10 丈)

# Step 1: Calculate 方亭積 (volume in cubic 尺)
方亭積 = Fraction(斛法 * 粟, 七十五)

# Step 2: Define the cubic equation components
# 方差自乘，三而一，為隅陽冪
隅陽冪 = Fraction(1, 3)

# Step 3: Calculate the cubic equation
# Using the procedure to find the dimensions
實 = 方亭積 - 隅陽冪 * 多差
方法 = 多差 * 隅陽冪 + 隅陽冪
廉法 = 多差 + 隅陽冪

# Step 4: Solve the cubic equation
上方 = pow(float(實 / 方法), 1/3)  # Approximation for cube root
上方 = Fraction(int(上方 * 10), 10)  # Convert to Fraction for precision

# Step 5: Calculate the other dimensions
下方 = 上方 + 多差
深 = 上方 + 深差

# Final answers
a = 上方  # Upper base (diameter of circular granary or side of square granary) in 丈
b = 下方  # Lower base in 丈
c = 深    # Depth in 丈

# Output the results
print(f"上方徑各 {a} 丈，下方徑各 {b} 丈，深各 {c} 丈。")


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Conversion Factors**:
   - The problem uses ancient Chinese units of measurement, so we convert everything into consistent units (丈 and 尺).
   - 1 丈 = 10 尺.

2. **Volume Calculation**:
   - The volume of the granaries is calculated using the given millet and conversion factors.

3. **Cubic Equation**:
   - The procedure involves solving a cubic equation to find the dimensions of the granaries. This is done step by step, following the ancient method.

4. **Final Dimensions**:
   - Once the cubic equation is solved, the dimensions of the granaries are calculated.

### Note:
This problem involves approximations for solving the cubic equation, as the exact method described in the ancient text is not fully detailed. The code provides a reasonable approximation based on the procedure.
