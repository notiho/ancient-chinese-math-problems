今有漆三得油四，油四和漆五。今有漆三斗，欲令分以易油，還自和餘漆。問︰出漆、得油、和漆各幾何？
術曰：假令出漆九升，不足六升。令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰：出漆 a斗 ，得油 b斗 ，和漆 c斗 ， d升 。

This problem involves a more complex proportional reasoning system, often referred to as the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method). Let's carefully translate the procedure into Python code step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given**:
   - 3 dou of lacquer (漆三斗) yields 4 dou of oil (得油四斗).
   - 4 dou of oil (油四斗) mixes with 5 dou of lacquer (漆五斗).
   - Now, there are 3 dou of lacquer (漆三斗), and we want to:
     - Exchange lacquer for oil.
     - Mix the remaining lacquer with the obtained oil.

2. **Question**:
   - How much lacquer is exchanged (出漆)?
   - How much oil is obtained (得油)?
   - How much lacquer and oil are mixed together (和漆)?

3. **Procedure**:
   - Use the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method) to calculate the amounts.

### Python Code Implementation:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 漆三得油四 (3 dou of lacquer yields 4 dou of oil)
漆率 = 3  # Rate of lacquer
油率 = 4  # Rate of oil

# 油四和漆五 (4 dou of oil mixes with 5 dou of lacquer)
油和率 = 4  # Rate of oil for mixing
漆和率 = 5  # Rate of lacquer for mixing

# 今有漆三斗 (Given 3 dou of lacquer)
總漆 = 3  # Total lacquer available

# Step 1: Calculate how much lacquer is exchanged (出漆)
# 盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。
所出率 = 漆率  # Rate of lacquer for exchange
盈 = 油率  # Excess (rate of oil obtained)
不足 = 漆率  # Deficiency (rate of lacquer given)

# 令維乘所出率，并以為實。
實 = 盈 * 不足

# 并盈、不足為法。
法 = 盈 + 不足

# 實如法而一。
出漆 = Fraction(實, 法)  # Amount of lacquer exchanged

# Step 2: Calculate how much oil is obtained (得油)
得油 = Fraction(油率, 漆率) * 出漆  # Oil obtained based on exchange rate

# Step 3: Calculate how much lacquer and oil are mixed together (和漆)
# Remaining lacquer after exchange
餘漆 = 總漆 - 出漆

# Total mixture of lacquer and oil
和漆 = 餘漆 + 得油

# Convert 和漆 into dou and sheng
和漆斗 = int(和漆)  # Whole dou
和漆升 = (和漆 - 和漆斗) * 10  # Remaining sheng (1 dou = 10 sheng)

# Final Results
a = 出漆  # Amount of lacquer exchanged (in dou)
b = 得油  # Amount of oil obtained (in dou)
c = 和漆斗  # Whole dou of the mixture
d = 和漆升  # Remaining sheng of the mixture

# Output results
a, b, c, d

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Step 1**: The "盈不足術" is applied to calculate how much lacquer is exchanged (`出漆`). This involves setting up the rates of lacquer and oil, and using the formula for "盈不足" to find the exchanged amount.
2. **Step 2**: The amount of oil obtained (`得油`) is calculated based on the exchange rate.
3. **Step 3**: The remaining lacquer after exchange is mixed with the obtained oil to calculate the total mixture (`和漆`), which is then converted into dou and sheng.

---

### Final Answer:
- `a`: Amount of lacquer exchanged (in dou).
- `b`: Amount of oil obtained (in dou).
- `c`: Whole dou of the mixture.
- `d`: Remaining sheng of the mixture.
