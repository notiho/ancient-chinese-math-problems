Suppose there are 565 households, and together they owe 8 shi, 5 jin, 3 liang, and 8 zhu of silk.
Question: how much silk does each household owe?

The procedure says:
List the silk amount as 8 shi, 5 jin, 3 liang, and 8 zhu.
Multiply the 8 shi by 4, obtaining 32 jun.
Multiply this by 30 jin, and add 5 jin, obtaining 965 jin.
Multiply this by 16 liang, and add 3 liang, obtaining 15,443 liang.
Multiply this by 24 zhu, and add 8 zhu, obtaining 370,640 zhu.
Divide this by 565 households, obtaining 656 zhu per household.
Divide this by 24 zhu, obtaining 27 liang and 8 zhu remaining.
Divide this by 16 liang, obtaining the final result.

Answer: *a* jin, *b* liang, *c* zhu.
