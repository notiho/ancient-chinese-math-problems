今有漆三得油四，油四和漆五。今有漆三斗，欲令分以易油，還自和餘漆。問︰出漆、得油、和漆各幾何？
術曰：假令出漆九升，不足六升。令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰：出漆 a斗 ，得油 b斗 ，和漆 c斗 ， d升 。

This problem involves a complex exchange and reconciliation of lacquer and oil based on given ratios. Let's break it down step by step and encode the solution in Python.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Ratios**:
   - 3 dou of lacquer can be exchanged for 4 dou of oil.
   - 4 dou of oil can be mixed with 5 dou of lacquer to form a mixture.

2. **Task**:
   - Start with 3 dou of lacquer.
   - Exchange some lacquer for oil.
   - Mix the obtained oil with the remaining lacquer.
   - Determine how much lacquer is exchanged, how much oil is obtained, and the final mixture of lacquer and oil.

3. **Procedure**:
   - Use the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method) to calculate the exchange and reconciliation.
   - Follow the rules for proportional exchange and reconciliation.

### Python Code Implementation:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 漆三得油四 (3 dou of lacquer gets 4 dou of oil)
漆_to_油_ratio = Fraction(4, 3)

# 油四和漆五 (4 dou of oil mixes with 5 dou of lacquer)
油_to_漆_ratio = Fraction(5, 4)

# 今有漆三斗 (Start with 3 dou of lacquer)
initial_漆 = 3

# Step 1: 假令出漆九升，不足六升 (Assume 9 sheng of lacquer is exchanged, leaving 6 sheng short)
# Convert dou to sheng (1 dou = 10 sheng)
假出漆 = 9 / 10  # 9 sheng = 0.9 dou
不足 = 6 / 10  # 6 sheng = 0.6 dou

# Step 2: 令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升 (Adjust to exchange 1 dou and 2 sheng, leaving 2 sheng extra)
adjusted_出漆 = 1 + Fraction(2, 10)  # 1 dou and 2 sheng = 1.2 dou
餘漆 = Fraction(2, 10)  # 2 sheng = 0.2 dou

# Step 3: Calculate 得油 (obtained oil) based on 漆_to_油_ratio
得油 = adjusted_出漆 * 漆_to_油_ratio

# Step 4: Calculate 和漆 (remaining lacquer after mixing with obtained oil)
和漆 = initial_漆 - adjusted_出漆 + 得油 * 油_to_漆_ratio

# Convert results to dou and sheng
出漆_dou = int(adjusted_出漆)
出漆_sheng = int((adjusted_出漆 - 出漆_dou) * 10)

得油_dou = int(得油)
得油_sheng = int((得油 - 得油_dou) * 10)

和漆_dou = int(和漆)
和漆_sheng = int((和漆 - 和漆_dou) * 10)

# Final Answer
a = 出漆_dou + Fraction(出漆_sheng, 10)  # 出漆 in dou
b = 得油_dou + Fraction(得油_sheng, 10)  # 得油 in dou
c = 和漆_dou  # 和漆 in dou
d = 和漆_sheng  # 和漆 in sheng

# Output results
print(f"出漆: {a}斗")
print(f"得油: {b}斗")
print(f"和漆: {c}斗 {d}升")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Ratios**:
   - The ratios for exchanging lacquer for oil and mixing oil with lacquer are represented as fractions for precise calculations.

2. **Assumptions**:
   - The problem assumes an initial hypothetical exchange (9 sheng of lacquer) and adjusts it to a more realistic scenario (1 dou and 2 sheng).

3. **Calculations**:
   - The amount of oil obtained (`得油`) is calculated based on the exchange ratio.
   - The remaining lacquer after mixing (`和漆`) is calculated by adding the obtained oil (converted to lacquer equivalent) to the leftover lacquer.

4. **Conversion**:
   - Results are converted from fractional dou to dou and sheng for clarity.

---

### Final Answer:
- 出漆: `a` dou
- 得油: `b` dou
- 和漆: `c` dou `d` sheng
