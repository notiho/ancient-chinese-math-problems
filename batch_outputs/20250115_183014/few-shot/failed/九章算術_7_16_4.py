今有善田一畝，價三百；惡田七畝，價五百。今并買一頃，價錢一萬。問︰善、惡田各幾何？
術曰：假令善田二十畝，惡田八十畝，多一千七百一十四錢、七分錢之二。令之善田一十畝，惡田九十畝，不足五百七十一錢、七分錢之三。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰：善田 a畝 ，惡田 b畝 。

This is a classic "excess and deficiency" (盈不足) problem. Let's translate the problem and solve it step by step in Python.

"""
Suppose there is good land (善田) of 1 mu, priced at 300 coins, and poor land (惡田) of 7 mu, priced at 500 coins.
Now, buying 1 qing (100 mu) together costs 10,000 coins.
Question: how many mu of good land and poor land are there?

The procedure says:
Assume 20 mu of good land and 80 mu of poor land. This exceeds the price by 1714 coins and 2/7 of a coin.
Assume 10 mu of good land and 90 mu of poor land. This falls short of the price by 571 coins and 3/7 of a coin.

The "excess and deficiency" procedure says:
Place the rates of output (所出率), with the excess (盈) and deficiency (不足) below them.
Multiply the rates of output by the assumed values, and add them to form the dividend (實).
Add the excess and deficiency to form the divisor (法).
Divide the dividend by the divisor to obtain 1 unit. If there are fractions, handle them.
For the excess and deficiency that correspond to the same purchased object, place the rates of output.
Subtract the smaller from the larger, and simplify the divisor and dividend.
The dividend becomes the price of the object, and the divisor becomes the number of people.

Answer: *a* mu of good land, *b* mu of poor land.
