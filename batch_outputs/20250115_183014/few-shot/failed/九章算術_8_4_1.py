今有上禾六秉，損實一斗八升，當下禾一十秉。下禾十五秉，損實五升，當上禾五秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾六秉正，下禾一十秉負，損實一斗八升正。次置上禾五秉負，下禾一十五秉正，損實五升正。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：上禾 a秉 實 b升 ，下禾 c秉 實 d升 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using the ancient Chinese method of elimination, as described in the "方程術" (method of solving simultaneous equations). Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.

### Problem Setup:
We are given:
1. 6 bundles of upper millet (上禾) lose 1 dou 8 sheng of grain, equivalent to 18 sheng, when compared to 10 bundles of lower millet (下禾).
2. 15 bundles of lower millet lose 5 sheng of grain when compared to 5 bundles of upper millet.

We are tasked to find the grain content of 1 bundle of upper millet and 1 bundle of lower millet.

### Procedure:
The method involves setting up two equations and solving them using elimination:
1. \( 6x - 10y = 18 \)
2. \( -5x + 15y = 5 \)

Where:
- \( x \) is the grain content of 1 bundle of upper millet (上禾).
- \( y \) is the grain content of 1 bundle of lower millet (下禾).

The solution involves eliminating variables step by step to find \( x \) and \( y \).

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Coefficients for the first equation: 6x - 10y = 18
上禾1 = 6
下禾1 = -10
實1 = 18

# Coefficients for the second equation: -5x + 15y = 5
上禾2 = -5
下禾2 = 15
實2 = 5

# Step 1: Eliminate 上禾 (x) by multiplying equations to align coefficients
# Multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 6
上禾1 *= 5
下禾1 *= 5
實1 *= 5

上禾2 *= 6
下禾2 *= 6
實2 *= 6

# Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate 上禾 (x)
下禾 = 下禾1 - 下禾2
實 = 實1 - 實2

# Solve for 下禾 (y)
y = Fraction(實, 下禾)

# Step 2: Substitute y back into one of the original equations to solve for 上禾 (x)
# Using the first equation: 6x - 10y = 18
實1 = 18  # Reset original values
x = Fraction(實1 - (-10 * y), 6)

# Results
a = 1  # 1 bundle of upper millet
b = x  # Grain content of 1 bundle of upper millet in sheng
c = 1  # 1 bundle of lower millet
d = y  # Grain content of 1 bundle of lower millet in sheng

# Output the results
a, b, c, d

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Equation Setup**: The two equations are set up based on the problem statement.
2. **Elimination**: The coefficients of \( x \) (上禾) are aligned by multiplying the equations, and then \( x \) is eliminated by subtraction.
3. **Solve for \( y \)**: After eliminating \( x \), the value of \( y \) (grain content of 1 bundle of lower millet) is calculated.
4. **Substitute Back**: The value of \( y \) is substituted back into one of the original equations to solve for \( x \) (grain content of 1 bundle of upper millet).
5. **Output**: The results are presented as \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \), where \( b \) and \( d \) are the grain contents of 1 bundle of upper and lower millet, respectively.

---

### Final Answer:
- \( a = 1 \) bundle of upper millet contains \( b \) sheng of grain.
- \( c = 1 \) bundle of lower millet contains \( d \) sheng of grain.
