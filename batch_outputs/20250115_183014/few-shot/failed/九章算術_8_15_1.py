This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using the ancient Chinese method of elimination, which is similar to Gaussian elimination. Let's break it down and solve step by step.

### Problem Restatement:
We are tasked with determining how many chickens are consumed by a single "令" (official), "吏" (clerk), and "從者" (attendant), based on the following conditions:

1. 1 official, 5 clerks, and 10 attendants eat 10 chickens.
2. 10 officials, 1 clerk, and 5 attendants eat 8 chickens.
3. 5 officials, 10 clerks, and 1 attendant eat 6 chickens.

We will solve this using the ancient Chinese elimination method ("方程術").

---

### Step 1: Represent the equations
Let:
- \( x \): the number of chickens eaten by one official (令),
- \( y \): the number of chickens eaten by one clerk (吏),
- \( z \): the number of chickens eaten by one attendant (從者).

The equations are:
1. \( x + 5y + 10z = 10 \)
2. \( 10x + y + 5z = 8 \)
3. \( 5x + 10y + z = 6 \)

---

### Step 2: Solve using elimination
We will follow the ancient method of elimination, which involves systematically eliminating variables.

#### Step 2.1: Eliminate \( x \) from the second and third equations
Multiply the first equation by 10 (to match the coefficient of \( x \) in the second equation):
\[
10(x + 5y + 10z) = 10 \cdot 10
\]
\[
10x + 50y + 100z = 100
\]

Now subtract the second equation (\( 10x + y + 5z = 8 \)) from this:
\[
(10x + 50y + 100z) - (10x + y + 5z) = 100 - 8
\]
\[
49y + 95z = 92 \tag{4}
\]

Next, multiply the first equation by 5 (to match the coefficient of \( x \) in the third equation):
\[
5(x + 5y + 10z) = 5 \cdot 10
\]
\[
5x + 25y + 50z = 50
\]

Now subtract the third equation (\( 5x + 10y + z = 6 \)) from this:
\[
(5x + 25y + 50z) - (5x + 10y + z) = 50 - 6
\]
\[
15y + 49z = 44 \tag{5}
\]

---

#### Step 2.2: Eliminate \( y \) from the two new equations
We now have two equations:
1. \( 49y + 95z = 92 \) (Equation 4)
2. \( 15y + 49z = 44 \) (Equation 5)

To eliminate \( y \), multiply Equation 5 by 49 and Equation 4 by 15:
\[
49(15y + 49z) = 49 \cdot 44
\]
\[
735y + 2401z = 2156 \tag{6}
\]

\[
15(49y + 95z) = 15 \cdot 92
\]
\[
735y + 1425z = 1380 \tag{7}
\]

Now subtract Equation 7 from Equation 6:
\[
(735y + 2401z) - (735y + 1425z) = 2156 - 1380
\]
\[
976z = 776
\]
\[
z = \frac{776}{976} = \frac{194}{244} = \frac{97}{122} \tag{8}
\]

---

#### Step 2.3: Solve for \( y \)
Substitute \( z = \frac{97}{122} \) into Equation 5 (\( 15y + 49z = 44 \)):
\[
15y + 49\left(\frac{97}{122}\right) = 44
\]
\[
15y + \frac{49 \cdot 97}{122} = 44
\]
\[
15y + \frac{4753}{122} = 44
\]
\[
15y = 44 - \frac{4753}{122}
\]
\[
15y = \frac{5368}{122} - \frac{4753}{122}
\]
\[
15y = \frac{615}{122}
\]
\[
y = \frac{615}{122 \cdot 15} = \frac{615}{1830} = \frac{41}{122} \tag{9}
\]

---

#### Step 2.4: Solve for \( x \)
Substitute \( y = \frac{41}{122} \) and \( z = \frac{97}{122} \) into the first equation (\( x + 5y + 10z = 10 \)):
\[
x + 5\left(\frac{41}{122}\right) + 10\left(\frac{97}{122}\right) = 10
\]
\[
x + \frac{205}{122} + \frac{970}{122} = 10
\]
\[
x + \frac{1175}{122} = 10
\]
\[
x = 10 - \frac{1175}{122}
\]
\[
x = \frac{1220}{122} - \frac{1175}{122}
\]
\[
x = \frac{45}{122} \tag{10}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
- \( x = \frac{45}{122} \): Each official eats \( \frac{45}{122} \) chickens.
- \( y = \frac{41}{122} \): Each clerk eats \( \frac{41}{122} \) chickens.
- \( z = \frac{97}{122} \): Each attendant eats \( \frac{97}{122} \) chickens.

Thus:
- \( a = \frac{45}{122} \), \( b = \frac{45}{122} \),
- \( c = \frac{41}{122} \), \( d = \frac{41}{122} \),
- \( e = \frac{97}{122} \), \( f = \frac{97}{122} \).
