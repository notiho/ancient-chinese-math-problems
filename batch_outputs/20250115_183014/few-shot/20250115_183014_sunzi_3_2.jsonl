Each side of the square contains 32 items. The question asks for the total number of items in the bundle.\n\nThe procedure describes an algorithm involving subtraction, addition, and positional manipulation, but the exact meaning of \"\u91cd\u7f6e\u4e8c\u4f4d\u5de6\u4f4d\u6e1b\u516b\u9918\u52a0\u53f3\u4f4d\" is unclear.

The procedure seems to involve repeatedly subtracting 8 from the \"left position\" of the given number (interpreted as the external circumference or a related value).\n2. The \"right position\" is interpreted as the remainder after subtraction or the last digit of the current value.\n3. The process continues until the value is reduced to 0, at which point 1 is added to the total.\n4. The total (`\u7a4d`) is the answer.\n\n---\n\n### Note:\nThe exact meaning of the procedure is unclear, and this is an attempt to interpret it based on the provided description.
