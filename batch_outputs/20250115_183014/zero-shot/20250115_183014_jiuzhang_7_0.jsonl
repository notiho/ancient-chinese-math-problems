The problem states that the total weight of 9 pieces of gold equals the total weight of 11 pieces of silver. This gives the equation `9a = 11b`.\n2.

By substituting `a = (11/9)b` from the first equation into the second equation, we solve for `b` (weight of one piece of silver).\n4.

The problem states that the total weight of 9 pieces of gold equals the total weight of 11 pieces of silver. This gives the equation `9a = 11b`.\n2. Additional conditions involve reducing or increasing the weight of gold by specific amounts and observing the resulting imbalance. These conditions are consistent with the first equation and do not provide new information.\n3.
