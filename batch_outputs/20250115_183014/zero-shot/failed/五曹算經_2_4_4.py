今有兵三千一百四十八人，人給布一丈二尺三寸。問：計㡬何？
術曰：列兵三千一百四十八人，以布一十二尺三寸乘之，得三萬八千七百二十尺四寸，以五十尺除之即得。
答曰： a端 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of cloth required for 3,148 soldiers, where each soldier is given 1丈2尺3寸 of cloth. In ancient Chinese units, 1丈 = 10尺, and 1尺 = 10寸. The total cloth is then divided by 50尺 to determine the number of units of 50尺.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Conversion of 1丈2尺3寸 to 尺
cloth_per_person = 1 * 10 + 2 + Fraction(3, 10)  # 1丈 = 10尺, 2尺, 3寸 = 3/10尺

# Total number of soldiers
soldiers = 3148

# Total cloth required in 尺
total_cloth = soldiers * cloth_per_person

# Divide total cloth by 50尺 to find the number of units
a = total_cloth / 50

# Result
a


"""


The variable `a` will hold the solution in terms of the number of units of 50尺 required.

"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 9675051/12500, Actual: 96801/125"""
