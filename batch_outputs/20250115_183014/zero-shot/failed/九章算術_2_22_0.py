"""
今有御米十四斗，欲為粟。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以御米求粟，五十之，二十一而一。
荅曰：為粟 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to convert "御米" (imperial rice) into "粟" (millet). The problem states that the conversion ratio is 50 to 21. This means 50 units of imperial rice are equivalent to 21 units of millet.

The given amount of imperial rice is 14斗 (14 "dou"). Let's calculate the equivalent amount of millet.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
imperial_rice = 14  # in dou
conversion_ratio = Fraction(21, 50)  # 21 millet per 50 imperial rice

# Calculation
a = imperial_rice * conversion_ratio  # millet in dou

# Result
a  # in dou


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of millet in "斗" (dou).
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 100/3, Actual: 147/25"""
