今有東南望波口，立兩表南、北相去九丈，以索薄地連之。當北表之西卻行去表六丈，薄地遙望波口南岸，入索北端四丈二寸。以望北岸，入前所望表里一丈二尺。又卻後行去表一十三丈五尺。薄地遙望波口南岸，與南表參合。問波口廣幾何？
術曰：以後去表乘入索，如表相去而一。所得，以前去表減之，餘以為法；復以前去表減後去表，餘以乘入所望表里為實，實如法而一，得波口廣。
答曰： a里 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the width of a river mouth ("波口廣") using the given measurements and relationships.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
north_south_distance = Fraction(9)  # Distance between the north and south poles (9丈)
first_north_offset = Fraction(6)  # Distance west from the north pole for the first observation (6丈)
first_south_entry = Fraction(4, 10)  # Rope entry at the south end for the first observation (4丈2寸 = 4丈 + 2/10丈)
first_north_entry = Fraction(12, 10)  # Rope entry at the north end for the first observation (1丈2尺 = 1丈 + 2/10丈)
second_north_offset = Fraction(135, 10)  # Distance west from the north pole for the second observation (13丈5尺 = 13丈 + 5/10丈)

# Step 1: Calculate the denominator (法)
denominator = (second_north_offset * first_south_entry) - (first_north_offset * north_south_distance)

# Step 2: Calculate the numerator (實)
numerator = (first_north_offset - second_north_offset) * first_north_entry

# Step 3: Calculate the width of the river mouth (波口廣)
a = numerator / denominator

# Output the result
a  # The width of the river mouth in 丈

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Given Data**: The problem provides distances in 丈 (zhang), 尺 (chi), and 寸 (cun). These are converted into fractions for precise calculations.
   - 1 丈 = 10 尺, 1 尺 = 10 寸.
   - For example, "4丈2寸" is converted to `4 + 2/10 = Fraction(42, 10)`.

2. **Denominator (法)**: The formula for the denominator is derived from the problem's instructions:
   \[
   \text{法} = (\text{後去表} \times \text{入索}) - (\text{前去表} \times \text{表相去})
   \]

3. **Numerator (實)**: The formula for the numerator is:
   \[
   \text{實} = (\text{前去表} - \text{後去表}) \times \text{入所望表里}
   \]

4. **Final Calculation**: The width of the river mouth is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{波口廣} = \frac{\text{實}}{\text{法}}
   \]

This code calculates the width of the river mouth (`a`) in 丈 as a fraction.
