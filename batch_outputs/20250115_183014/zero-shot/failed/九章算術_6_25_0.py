今有池，五渠注之。其一渠開之，少半日一滿；次，一日一滿；次，二日半一滿；次，三日一滿；次，五日一滿。今皆決之，問︰幾何日滿池？
術曰：各置渠一日滿池之數，并以為法。以一日為實。實如法得一日。
荅曰： a日 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many days it will take for the pool to fill up when all five channels are opened simultaneously. Each channel fills the pool at a different rate. Let's represent the rates as fractions of the pool filled per day.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Rates of each channel filling the pool per day
rate1 = Fraction(2, 1)  # Half a day to fill the pool -> 2 pools per day
rate2 = Fraction(1, 1)  # One day to fill the pool -> 1 pool per day
rate3 = Fraction(2, 5)  # Two and a half days to fill the pool -> 2/5 pools per day
rate4 = Fraction(1, 3)  # Three days to fill the pool -> 1/3 pools per day
rate5 = Fraction(1, 5)  # Five days to fill the pool -> 1/5 pools per day

# Total rate when all channels are opened
total_rate = rate1 + rate2 + rate3 + rate4 + rate5

# Time to fill the pool (1 pool divided by total rate)
a = Fraction(1, total_rate)

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'
a


"""


The variable `a` will contain the number of days it takes to fill the pool when all five channels are opened.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 15/74, Actual: 15/59"""
