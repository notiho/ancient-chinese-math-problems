假令有股弦相乘冪七百二十六，句七、十分之七。問：股多少？
術曰：冪自乘，為實。句自乘，為方法，從。開方除之，所得又開方，即股
答曰：股 a 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the value of "股" (denoted as "a") given the following:

- The product of 股 (a) and 弦 (hypotenuse) is the "冪" (area), which is 726.
- The "句" (base) is given as 7 and 7/10 (7.7 in decimal or 77/10 as a fraction).

The solution involves the following steps:
1. Square the "冪" (area) to get the "實".
2. Square the "句" (base) to get the "方法".
3. Divide "實" by "方法".
4. Take the square root of the result to find "股" (a).

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
冪 = 726
句 = Fraction(77, 10)  # 7 and 7/10 as a fraction

# Step 1: Square the "冪" to get "實"
實 = 冪 ** 2

# Step 2: Square the "句" to get "方法"
方法 = 句 ** 2

# Step 3: Divide "實" by "方法"
result = 實 / 方法

# Step 4: Take the square root of the result to find "股" (a)
a = result ** Fraction(1, 2)

# The value of "股" (a) is now stored in the variable "a"
a


"""


The variable `a` will contain the solution for "股".

"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 132/5, Actual: 94.28571428571428"""
