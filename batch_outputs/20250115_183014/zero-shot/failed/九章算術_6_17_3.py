今有五人分五錢，令上二人所得與下三人等。問︰各得幾何？
術曰：置錢錐行衰，并上二人為九，并下三人為六。六少於九，三。以三均加焉，副并為法。以所分錢乘未并者各自為實。實如法得一錢。
荅曰：甲得 a錢 ，乙得 b錢 ，丙得 c錢 ，丁得 d錢 ，戊得 e錢 。

To solve the problem, we need to distribute 5 units of money among 5 people (甲, 乙, 丙, 丁, 戊) such that the sum of the amounts received by the first two people (甲 and 乙) equals the sum of the amounts received by the last three people (丙, 丁, 戊). 

We will translate this into Python code and compute the values of the unknowns.


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total money to be distributed
total_money = 5

# Let the amounts received by 甲, 乙, 丙, 丁, 戊 be a, b, c, d, e respectively.
# We know:
# 1. a + b + c + d + e = total_money
# 2. a + b = c + d + e

# From equation (2), we can substitute c + d + e with a + b in equation (1):
# a + b + (a + b) = total_money
# 2a + 2b = total_money
# a + b = total_money / 2

# Now, distribute the money equally among the five people:
a = Fraction(1, 1)  # 1 unit of money
b = Fraction(1, 1)  # 1 unit of money
c = Fraction(1, 1)  # 1 unit of money
d = Fraction(1, 1)  # 1 unit of money
e = Fraction(1, 1)  # 1 unit of money

# Verify the conditions:
# 1. a + b + c + d + e == total_money
assert a + b + c + d + e == total_money
# 2. a + b == c + d + e
assert a + b == c + d + e

# The solution:
# 甲得 a錢, 乙得 b錢, 丙得 c錢, 丁得 d錢, 戊得 e錢.

### Solution:
- 甲 (a) 得 1 錢
- 乙 (b) 得 1 錢
- 丙 (c) 得 1 錢
- 丁 (d) 得 1 錢
- 戊 (e) 得 1 錢
