今有甲禾二秉、乙禾三秉、丙禾四秉，重皆過於石。甲二重如乙一，乙三重如丙一，丙四重如甲一。問︰甲、乙、丙禾一秉各重幾何？
術曰：如方程，置重過於石之物為負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：甲禾 a秉 重 b石 ，乙禾 c秉 重 d石 ，丙禾 e秉 重 f石 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves determining the weights of different types of grain (甲, 乙, 丙) based on their relationships. Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Relationships:
# 甲二重如乙一 -> 2 * weight_甲 = 1 * weight_乙
# 乙三重如丙一 -> 3 * weight_乙 = 1 * weight_丙
# 丙四重如甲一 -> 4 * weight_丙 = 1 * weight_甲

# Solve for weights in terms of one variable
# Let weight_甲 = a
a = Fraction(1)  # Assume weight_甲 = 1 unit for simplicity
b = Fraction(2) * a  # weight_乙 = 2 * weight_甲
c = Fraction(3) * b  # weight_丙 = 3 * weight_乙

# Assign the results to variables
weight_甲 = a
weight_乙 = b
weight_丙 = c

# Output the results
print(f"甲禾一秉重: {weight_甲} 石")
print(f"乙禾一秉重: {weight_乙} 石")
print(f"丙禾一秉重: {weight_丙} 石")


"""


### Explanation:
1. The relationships between the weights are given:
   - 甲's weight is twice that of 乙.
   - 乙's weight is three times that of 丙.
   - 丙's weight is four times that of 甲.
2. We solve for the weights using these relationships, starting with an assumption for one variable (e.g., `weight_甲 = 1`).
3. Using the relationships, we calculate the weights of 乙 and 丙 in terms of 甲.
4. The results are stored in variables `weight_甲`, `weight_乙`, and `weight_丙`.

### Output:
The code will output the weights of 甲, 乙, and 丙 in terms of "石" (a unit of weight).
