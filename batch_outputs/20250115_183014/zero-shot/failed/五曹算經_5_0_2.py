今有五百六十五户，户責絲一斤十一两八銖。問：計絲㡬何？
術曰：列一斤通作十六两，納十一两得二十七两；以二十四銖乘之、納八銖，得六百五十六銖；以乘户五百六十五，得三十七萬六百四十銖；以二十四銖除之，得一萬五千四百四十三两奇八銖；又以十六两除之，得九百六十五斤奇三两；以三十斤除之，得三十二鈞奇五斤；又以四鈞除之即得。
答曰： a石 b 两 c銖 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code step by step. The problem involves converting units and performing arithmetic operations to calculate the total amount of silk required. Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
households = 565  # Number of households
silk_per_household_jin = 1  # Silk per household in jin
silk_per_household_liang = 11  # Silk per household in liang
silk_per_household_zhu = 8  # Silk per household in zhu

# Conversion factors
liang_per_jin = 16  # 1 jin = 16 liang
zhu_per_liang = 24  # 1 liang = 24 zhu

# Step 1: Convert silk per household to zhu
silk_per_household_total_liang = silk_per_household_jin * liang_per_jin + silk_per_household_liang
silk_per_household_total_zhu = silk_per_household_total_liang * zhu_per_liang + silk_per_household_zhu

# Step 2: Calculate total silk in zhu for all households
total_silk_zhu = silk_per_household_total_zhu * households

# Step 3: Convert total silk from zhu to liang
total_silk_liang = total_silk_zhu // zhu_per_liang
remaining_zhu = total_silk_zhu % zhu_per_liang

# Step 4: Convert total silk from liang to jin
total_silk_jin = total_silk_liang // liang_per_jin
remaining_liang = total_silk_liang % liang_per_jin

# Step 5: Convert total silk from jin to shi (1 shi = 30 jin)
shi_per_jin = 30
total_silk_shi = total_silk_jin // shi_per_jin
remaining_jin = total_silk_jin % shi_per_jin

# Final answer
a = total_silk_shi
b = remaining_jin
c = remaining_liang + Fraction(remaining_zhu, zhu_per_liang)

# Output the results
a, b, c


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Data**: The number of households and the amount of silk required per household in jin, liang, and zhu are given.
2. **Unit Conversion**: Convert all units to the smallest unit (zhu) for easier calculations.
3. **Total Silk Calculation**: Multiply the silk required per household (in zhu) by the number of households.
4. **Back Conversion**: Convert the total silk from zhu to liang, then to jin, and finally to shi (30 jin = 1 shi).
5. **Answer**: The final result is expressed in shi, jin, and a fractional liang.

### Output:
The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` represent the total silk in shi, jin, and fractional liang, respectively.
