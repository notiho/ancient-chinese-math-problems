今有索，長五千七百九十四步。欲使作方。問：幾何？
術曰：置長五千七百九十四步，以四除之，得一千四百四十八步，餘二步，以六因之，得一丈二尺，以四除之，得三尺，通計即得。
答曰： a步 b尺 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. Here's the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given length in steps
length_in_steps = 5794

# Divide the length by 4 to get the side length in steps
side_length_in_steps = length_in_steps // 4
remainder_in_steps = length_in_steps % 4

# Convert the remainder into zhang and chi
# 1 step = 6 chi
remainder_in_chi = remainder_in_steps * 6

# Convert chi into zhang and chi
zhang = remainder_in_chi // 10  # 1 zhang = 10 chi
chi = remainder_in_chi % 10

# Combine the results
a = side_length_in_steps
b = chi

# The answer is stored in variables `a` (steps) and `b` (chi)


"""


### Explanation:
1. The total length is 5794 steps.
2. Divide the total length by 4 to find the side length in steps (`a`) and the remainder in steps.
3. Convert the remainder in steps to chi (1 step = 6 chi).
4. Convert chi into zhang and chi (1 zhang = 10 chi).
5. The final answer is `a` steps and `b` chi.

### Final Answer:
- `a` = 1448 (steps)
- `b` = 3 (chi)
