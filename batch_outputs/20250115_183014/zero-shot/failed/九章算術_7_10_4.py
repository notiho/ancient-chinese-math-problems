今有蒲生一日，長三尺。莞生一日，長一尺。蒲生日自半。莞生日自倍。問︰幾何日而長等？

To solve the problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves two plants, "蒲" and "莞", growing at different rates and starting from different initial conditions. We need to determine after how many days their lengths will be equal.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Growth Rates**:
   - 蒲 grows 3 feet per day but starts at half its daily growth on the first day.
   - 莞 grows 1 foot per day but starts at double its daily growth on the first day.

2. **Conditions**:
   - After 2 days, the difference in their lengths is less than 1.5 feet.
   - After 3 days, the difference in their lengths is more than 1.75 feet.

3. **Goal**:
   - Find the number of days (`a`) it takes for their lengths to be equal.
   - Determine their lengths (`b`) at that time.

We will use the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method) to solve this problem.

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Growth rates and initial conditions
growth_pu = Fraction(3)  # 蒲 grows 3 feet per day
growth_guan = Fraction(1)  # 莞 grows 1 foot per day

# Initial growth adjustments
initial_pu = growth_pu / 2  # 蒲 starts at half its daily growth
initial_guan = growth_guan * 2  # 莞 starts at double its daily growth

# Lengths after 2 days
length_pu_2 = initial_pu + growth_pu * 1 + growth_pu * 1  # 蒲's length after 2 days
length_guan_2 = initial_guan + growth_guan * 1 + growth_guan * 1  # 莞's length after 2 days
difference_2 = length_pu_2 - length_guan_2  # Difference after 2 days

# Lengths after 3 days
length_pu_3 = initial_pu + growth_pu * 1 + growth_pu * 1 + growth_pu * 1  # 蒲's length after 3 days
length_guan_3 = initial_guan + growth_guan * 1 + growth_guan * 1 + growth_guan * 1  # 莞's length after 3 days
difference_3 = length_pu_3 - length_guan_3  # Difference after 3 days

# Using the Excess and Deficiency Method
rate_difference = difference_3 - difference_2  # Rate of change in the difference
a = (growth_pu - growth_guan) / rate_difference  # Number of days until lengths are equal

# Calculate the length at that time
b = initial_pu + growth_pu * (a - 1)  # Length of both plants when they are equal

# Results
a = a.limit_denominator()  # Simplify the fraction for days
b = b.limit_denominator()  # Simplify the fraction for length

# Outputs
a  # Number of days
b  # Length of both plants

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Growth Rates and Initial Conditions**:
   - We calculate the initial growth adjustments for both plants.
   - We compute their lengths after 2 and 3 days.

2. **Excess and Deficiency Method**:
   - We calculate the rate of change in the difference between their lengths.
   - Using this rate, we determine the number of days (`a`) it takes for their lengths to be equal.

3. **Length at Equal Time**:
   - We calculate the length (`b`) of both plants when they are equal.

4. **Results**:
   - The values of `a` (days) and `b` (length) are simplified using `limit_denominator()`.

---

### Final Answer:
The solution will provide the number of days (`a`) and the length (`b`) when both plants are of equal length.
