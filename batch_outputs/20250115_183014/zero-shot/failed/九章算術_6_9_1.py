今有絡絲一斤為練絲一十二兩，練絲一斤為青絲一斤十二銖。今有青絲一斤，問︰本絡絲幾何？
術曰：以練絲十二兩乘青絲一斤一十二銖為法。以青絲一斤銖數乘練絲一斤兩數，又以絡絲一斤乘之，為實。實如法得一斤。
荅曰： a斤 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves converting between different units of silk: 絡絲 (raw silk), 練絲 (refined silk), and 青絲 (dyed silk). Here's the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
練絲_per_絡絲 = Fraction(12, 16)  # 12兩 (liang) per 1斤 (jin), converted to fraction of a jin
青絲_per_練絲 = Fraction(1, 1) + Fraction(12, 16 * 16)  # 1斤 12銖 (zhu), converted to fraction of a jin

# 青絲 is given as 1斤
青絲 = Fraction(1, 1)

# Calculate the amount of 絡絲 (raw silk) needed
a = 青絲 / (練絲_per_絡絲 * 青絲_per_練絲)

# Output the result
a  # This is the amount of 絡絲 in jin


"""


### Explanation:
1. **練絲_per_絡絲**: Each 1斤 of raw silk (絡絲) produces 12兩 of refined silk (練絲). Since 1斤 = 16兩, this is represented as `12/16` in terms of jin.
2. **青絲_per_練絲**: Each 1斤 of refined silk (練絲) produces 1斤 12銖 of dyed silk (青絲). Since 1斤 = 16兩 and 1兩 = 16銖, 12銖 is `12/(16*16)` jin. Thus, the total is `1 + 12/(16*16)` jin.
3. **青絲**: The problem states we have 1斤 of 青絲.
4. **a**: Using the formula provided in the problem, we calculate the amount of 絡絲 needed.

### Result:
The variable `a` will contain the amount of 絡絲 in jin as a `Fraction`.
