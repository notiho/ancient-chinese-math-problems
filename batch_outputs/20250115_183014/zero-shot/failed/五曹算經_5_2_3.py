今有七百三十八户，共請絲二十七斤五两。問：户得㡬何？
術曰：列絲二十七斤，以十六两乘之、納五两，得四百三十七两；又以二十四銖乘之，得一萬四百八十八銖；以七百三十八户除之即得。
答曰： a銖 b 絫 c黍 奇 d銖 e黍 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much silk each household gets. Here's how we can translate the problem into Python code:

1. Convert the total silk into smaller units:
   - 1斤 = 16两
   - 1两 = 24銖
   - 1銖 = 10黍

2. Distribute the total silk among the households.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total silk in jin and liang
total_jin = 27
total_liang = 5

# Convert total silk to liangs
total_liang = total_jin * 16 + total_liang  # 1 jin = 16 liang

# Convert total silk to zhu (銖)
total_zhu = total_liang * 24  # 1 liang = 24 zhu

# Convert total silk to shu (黍)
total_shu = total_zhu * 10  # 1 zhu = 10 shu

# Total households
households = 738

# Silk per household in shu
silk_per_household_shu = Fraction(total_shu, households)

# Convert back to jin, liang, zhu, and shu
a = silk_per_household_shu // (16 * 24 * 10)  # jin
remaining_shu = silk_per_household_shu % (16 * 24 * 10)

b = remaining_shu // (24 * 10)  # liang
remaining_shu %= (24 * 10)

c = remaining_shu // 10  # zhu
d = remaining_shu % 10  # shu

# Results
a = int(a)  # jin
b = int(b)  # liang
c = int(c)  # zhu
d = int(d)  # shu


"""


The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will contain the solution in terms of jin, liang, zhu, and shu respectively.
