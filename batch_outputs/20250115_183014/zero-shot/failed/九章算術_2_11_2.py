"""
今有粟四斗一升、太半升，欲為答。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求菽、答、麻、麥，皆九之，十而一。
荅曰：為答 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to compute the value of "a" based on the given information.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The total amount of 粟 (grain) is given as 4斗1升 and 太半升.
   - 1斗 = 10升, so 4斗1升 = 41升.
   - 太半升 = 0.5升 (half a 升).
   - Total 粟 = 41升 + 0.5升 = 41.5升.

2. The rule states that to convert 粟 into 答, we multiply the total 粟 by 9 and then divide by 10.

### Python Code:

"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total 粟 in 升
粟 = Fraction(41.5)  # 41升 + 0.5升

# Conversion rule: multiply by 9, divide by 10
a = 粟 * Fraction(9, 10)

# Result in 斗
a = a / 10  # Convert 升 to 斗 (1斗 = 10升)

# Output the result
a


"""


### Explanation:
- We first calculate the total 粟 in 升.
- Then, we apply the conversion rule (multiply by 9 and divide by 10).
- Finally, we convert the result from 升 to 斗 by dividing by 10.

### Final Answer:
The value of "a" is stored in the variable `a` as a Fraction.

Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 15/4, Actual: 747/200"""
