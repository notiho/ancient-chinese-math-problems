今有糲米十五斗五升、五分升之二，欲為粟。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以糲米求粟，五之，三而一。
荅曰：為粟 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem states that we have a certain amount of 糲米 (coarse rice) and want to convert it into 粟 (millet). The rule for conversion is: multiply the amount of 糲米 by 5, then divide by 3.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given 糲米 (coarse rice) amount in units of 斗 (dou), 升 (sheng), and 分升 (fraction of a sheng)
liangmi = Fraction(15) + Fraction(5, 10) + Fraction(2, 10 * 10)  # 15斗5升2分升

# Conversion rule: multiply by 5, then divide by 3
a = liangmi * 5 / 3  # 粟 (millet) in 斗

# Result
a  # 粟 in 斗


"""


### Explanation:
1. The amount of 糲米 is given as 15斗5升2分升. We convert this into a single fraction:
   - 1斗 = 10升, so 5升 = 5/10斗.
   - 1升 = 10分升, so 2分升 = 2/(10*10)斗.
   - Total = 15斗 + 5/10斗 + 2/(10*10)斗 = `Fraction(15) + Fraction(5, 10) + Fraction(2, 100)`.

2. The conversion rule is to multiply the amount of 糲米 by 5, then divide by 3.

3. The result is stored in the variable `a`, which represents the amount of 粟 in 斗.

### Final Answer:
The variable `a` contains the amount of 粟 in 斗 as a fraction.

Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 259/10, Actual: 388/15"""
