今有粟，三十六萬九千九百八十斛七斗，在倉九年，年斛耗三升。問：一年、九年各耗幾何？
術曰：置三十六萬九千九百八十斛七斗，以三升乘之，得一年之耗，又以九乘之，即九年之耗。
答曰： a年 耗 b斛 ， c年 耗 d斛 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of grain lost in one year and nine years. The total amount of grain is given as 369,980斛7斗, and the annual loss is 3升 per 斛. 

In ancient Chinese measurements:
1 斛 = 10 斗  
1 斗 = 10 升  

We will convert the total grain into 升, calculate the annual loss, and then compute the loss for one year and nine years.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total grain in 升
total_grain_in_sheng = (369980 * 10 + 7) * 10  # Convert 369,980斛7斗 to 升

# Annual loss in 升
annual_loss_in_sheng = total_grain_in_sheng * Fraction(3, 10)  # 3升 per 斛

# Loss for one year
a = annual_loss_in_sheng

# Loss for nine years
b = annual_loss_in_sheng * 9

# Convert results back to 斛 for clarity
a_in_hu = a / 100  # Convert 升 to 斛 (1斛 = 100升)
b_in_hu = b / 100  # Convert 升 to 斛 (1斛 = 100升)

# Final answers
a = a_in_hu
b = b_in_hu


"""


After running this code, the variables `a` and `b` will contain the annual loss and nine-year loss in 斛, respectively.
