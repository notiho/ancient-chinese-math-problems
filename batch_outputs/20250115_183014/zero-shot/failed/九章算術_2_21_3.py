今有鑿米三斗、少半升，欲為粟。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以鑿米求粟，二十五之，十三而一。
荅曰：為粟 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem states that we have 3斗 (dǒu) and 0.5升 (shēng) of "鑿米" (záo mǐ), and we want to convert it into "粟" (sù). The conversion rule is given as: for every 25 units of "鑿米," we get 13 units of "粟."

Let's compute the value of "a" (the amount of 粟 in 斗):


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
záo_mǐ_dǒu = 3  # 鑿米 in 斗
záo_mǐ_shēng = Fraction(1, 2)  # 鑿米 in 升

# Conversion factor: 1斗 = 10升
záo_mǐ_total_shēng = záo_mǐ_dǒu * 10 + záo_mǐ_shēng  # Total 鑿米 in 升

# Conversion rule: 25 units of 鑿米 -> 13 units of 粟
粟_per_鑿米 = Fraction(13, 25)

# Calculate 粟 in 升
sù_total_shēng = záo_mǐ_total_shēng * 粟_per_鑿米

# Convert 粟 from 升 to 斗 (1斗 = 10升)
a = sù_total_shēng / 10  # 粟 in 斗

# Result
a


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 粟 in 斗 as a `Fraction`.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 455/72, Actual: 793/500"""
