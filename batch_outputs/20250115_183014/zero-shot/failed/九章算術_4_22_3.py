今有積四千五百尺。問︰為立圓徑幾何？
開立圓術曰：置積尺數，以十六乘之，九而一，所得開立方除之，即丸徑。
荅曰： a尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical procedure into Python code. The problem involves finding the diameter of a sphere (立圓徑) given its volume (積). The formula provided in the text can be interpreted as follows:

1. Multiply the volume by 16.
2. Divide the result by 9.
3. Take the cube root of the result.
4. The result is the diameter of the sphere.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given volume of the sphere in cubic feet
volume = 4500  # in cubic feet

# Step 1: Multiply the volume by 16
step1 = volume * 16

# Step 2: Divide the result by 9
step2 = Fraction(step1, 9)

# Step 3: Take the cube root of the result
a = step2 ** Fraction(1, 3)  # Diameter of the sphere in feet

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'


"""


The variable `a` now contains the diameter of the sphere in feet, represented as a `Fraction`.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 20, Actual: 19.999999999999996"""
