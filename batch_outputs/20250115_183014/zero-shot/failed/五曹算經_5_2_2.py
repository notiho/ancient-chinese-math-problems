今有七百三十八户，共請絲二十七斤五两。問：户得㡬何？
術曰：列絲二十七斤，以十六两乘之、納五两，得四百三十七两；又以二十四銖乘之，得一萬四百八十八銖；以七百三十八户除之即得。
答曰： a銖 b 絫 c黍 奇 d銖 e黍 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much silk each household gets. The total silk is given as 27斤5两, and there are 738 households. The units are as follows:

1 斤 = 16 两  
1 两 = 24 銖  
1 銖 = 10 黍  

The problem asks us to compute the amount of silk each household gets in terms of 銖, 絫, 黍, and 奇 (奇 represents the remainder in 銖 and 黍).

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total silk in 两
total_silk_liang = 27 * 16 + 5  # Convert 27斤5两 to 两
# Total silk in 銖
total_silk_zhu = total_silk_liang * 24  # Convert 两 to 銖

# Number of households
households = 738

# Silk per household in 銖
silk_per_household_zhu = Fraction(total_silk_zhu, households)

# Convert 銖 to 絫 and 黍
a = silk_per_household_zhu.numerator // silk_per_household_zhu.denominator  # 銖
remainder_zhu = silk_per_household_zhu - a  # Remaining 銖 as a fraction

b = remainder_zhu.numerator * 10 // remainder_zhu.denominator  # 黍
remainder_dshu =
