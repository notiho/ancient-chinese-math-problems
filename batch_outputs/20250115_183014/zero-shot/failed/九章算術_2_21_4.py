"""
今有鑿米三斗、少半升，欲為粟。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以鑿米求粟，二十五之，十三而一。
荅曰：為粟 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to convert "鑿米" (polished rice) into "粟" (unpolished rice) using the given ratio: 25 units of polished rice yield 13 units of unpolished rice.

The given amount of polished rice is 3斗 (dou) and 0.5升 (sheng). Since 1斗 = 10升, this is equivalent to \(3斗 + 0.5升 = 30.5升\).

The conversion ratio is \(25 : 13\), meaning 25 units of polished rice yield 13 units of unpolished rice. To find the amount of unpolished rice, we multiply the given amount of polished rice by \(\frac{13}{25}\).

Here is the Python code to compute the answer:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given amount of polished rice
polished_rice = Fraction(30, 1) + Fraction(1, 2)  # 3斗 + 0.5升 = 30.5升

# Conversion ratio
conversion_ratio = Fraction(13, 25)

# Calculate the amount of unpolished rice
a = polished_rice * conversion_ratio  # Result in 升

# Convert the result to 斗 (1斗 = 10升)
a = a / 10  # Result in 斗

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of unpolished rice in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 455/72, Actual: 793/500"""
