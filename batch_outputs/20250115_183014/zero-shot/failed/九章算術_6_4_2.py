今有粟七斗，三人分舂之，一人為糲米，一人為粺米，一人為鑿米，令米數等。問︰取粟為米各幾何？
術曰：列置糲米三十，粺米二十七，鑿米二十四，而反衰之，副并為法。以七斗乘未并者，各自為取粟實。實如法得一斗。若求米等者，以本率各乘定所取粟為實，以粟率五十為法，實如法得一斗。
荅曰：糲米取粟 a斗 。粺米取粟 b斗 。鑿米取粟 c斗 。為米各 d斗 。

To solve the problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. Here's the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_grain = 7  # in dou
grain_rates = [30, 27, 24]  # rates for 糲米, 粺米, 鑿米
grain_sum_rate = sum(grain_rates)  # sum of rates

# Calculate the amount of grain each person takes
a = Fraction(total_grain * grain_rates[0], grain_sum_rate)  # 糲米取粟
b = Fraction(total_grain * grain_rates[1], grain_sum_rate)  # 粺米取粟
c = Fraction(total_grain * grain_rates[2], grain_sum_rate)  # 鑿米取粟

# Calculate the amount of 米 each person produces
total_rate = 50  # total rate for 米
d = Fraction(total_grain, total_rate)  # 米 produced by each person

# Results
a, b, c, d


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Grain Distribution**:
   - The total grain is divided among three people based on their respective rates (30, 27, 24).
   - The proportion of grain each person takes is calculated using the formula:  
     \( \text{grain taken} = \frac{\text{total grain} \times \text{rate}}{\text{sum of rates}} \).

2. **米 Production**:
   - Each person produces 米 in equal amounts.
   - The 米 production rate is given as 50, so the 米 produced by each person is calculated using the formula:  
     \( \text{米 produced} = \frac{\text{total grain}}{\text{total rate}} \).

3. **Results**:
   - The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` represent the amount of grain taken by each person and the 米 produced, respectively.

### Output:
The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will contain the respective values in terms of fractions.
