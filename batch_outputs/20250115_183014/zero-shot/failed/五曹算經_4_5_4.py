今有方窖從一丈三尺廣六尺深一丈。問：受粟㡬何？
術曰：列從一丈三尺以廣六尺乘之得七十八尺以深一丈乘之得七百八十尺以斛法除之即得。
答曰： a斛 奇 b寸 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of a rectangular pit and convert it into a traditional Chinese unit of measurement for grain, which is "斛" (hú). The dimensions of the pit are given in Chinese units: 長 (length) = 1丈3尺, 廣 (width) = 6尺, and 深 (depth) = 1丈. 

1丈 = 10尺, so we first convert all dimensions into 尺 (feet).  
The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is:  
Volume = 長 × 廣 × 深.

Finally, we divide the volume by the conversion factor to determine how many "斛" and "寸" the pit can hold. The problem doesn't specify the conversion factor, but traditionally, 1斛 = 10 cubic 尺.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Dimensions of the pit
length = 1 * 10 + 3  # 1丈3尺 = 13尺
width = 6  # 6尺
depth = 1 * 10  # 1丈 = 10尺

# Calculate the volume in cubic 尺
volume = length * width * depth  # Volume in cubic 尺

# Conversion factor: 1斛 = 10 cubic 尺
hu_conversion = 10

# Calculate the number of 斛 and remaining cubic 尺 (寸)
a = volume // hu_conversion  # Number of 斛
b = volume % hu_conversion  # Remaining cubic 尺 (寸)

# Results
a = Fraction(a)  # Number of 斛
b = Fraction(b)  # Remaining cubic 尺 (寸)


"""


After running this code, the variables `a` and `b` will contain the number of "斛" and "寸" respectively.
