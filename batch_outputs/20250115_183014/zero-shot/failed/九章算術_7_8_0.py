今有米在十斗桶中，不知其數。滿中添粟而舂之，得米七斗。問︰故米幾何？
術曰：以盈不足術求之，假令故米二斗，不足二升。令之三斗，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰： a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will use the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method). The problem involves determining the amount of rice ("a", in units of "斗") originally in the bucket.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. Assume the original amount of rice is "a" (斗).
2. When 10斗 of the bucket is filled with millet and then milled, the resulting rice is 7斗.
3. Two test cases are given:
   - If the original rice is assumed to be 2斗, the result is short by 2升 (不足 2升).
   - If the original rice is assumed to be 3斗, the result exceeds by 2升 (有餘 2升).

Note: 1斗 = 10升, so 2升 = 2/10斗 = 1/5斗.

Using the "盈不足術" method:
- Let the deficiency (不足) be \( b = 2升 = \frac{1}{5}斗 \).
- Let the excess (盈) be \( c = 2升 = \frac{1}{5}斗 \).
- Let the difference between the two assumptions (2斗 and 3斗) be \( d = 3 - 2 = 1斗 \).

The formula for the unknown \( a \) (original rice) is:
\[
a = \frac{d \cdot b}{b + c}
\]

### Python Code:

"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
b = Fraction(1, 5)  # Deficiency (不足) in 斗
c = Fraction(1, 5)  # Excess (盈) in 斗
d = Fraction(1)     # Difference between assumptions in 斗

# Compute the original amount of rice (a)
a = d * b / (b + c)

# Output the result
a


"""


### Solution:
The value of \( a \) (original rice) is stored in the variable `a`.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 5/2, Actual: 1/2"""
