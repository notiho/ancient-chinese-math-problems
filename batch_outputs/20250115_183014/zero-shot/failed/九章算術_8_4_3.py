今有上禾六秉，損實一斗八升，當下禾一十秉。下禾十五秉，損實五升，當上禾五秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾六秉正，下禾一十秉負，損實一斗八升正。次置上禾五秉負，下禾一十五秉正，損實五升正。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：上禾 a秉 實 b升 ，下禾 c秉 實 d升 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves solving a system of linear equations to find the values of the unknowns. Here's the Python code:



### Final Answer:

"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Define the equations based on the problem description
# Let:
# a = the amount of 上禾 (upper grain) in one 秉 (sheaf)
# b = the amount of 下禾 (lower grain) in one 秉 (sheaf)

# Equation 1: 6a - 10b = 1斗8升
# Equation 2: -5a + 15b = 5升

# Convert the units into consistent terms (斗 and 升)
# 1斗 = 10升
# Equation 1 becomes: 6a - 10b = 18升
# Equation 2 becomes: -5a + 15b = 5升

# Solve the system of equations
# Multiply Equation 1 by 5 and Equation 2 by 6 to eliminate 'a'
# 30a - 50b = 90
# -30a + 90b = 30

# Add the two equations:
# 40b = 120
b = Fraction(120, 40)  # b = 3升

# Substitute b = 3升 into Equation 1 to solve for 'a'
# 6a - 10(3) = 18
# 6a - 30 = 18
# 6a = 48
a = Fraction(48, 6)  # a = 8升

# The solution is:
# 上禾 (a) = 8升 per 秉
# 下禾 (b) = 3升 per 秉

a = Fraction(8)  # 上禾實一秉 = 8升
b = Fraction(3)  # 下禾實一秉 = 3升

This Python code computes the values of the unknowns `a` and `b` using the system of equations derived from the problem. The units are consistent, and the solution is expressed in terms of `升`.
