今有丁二萬三千六百九十二人，責兵五千九百二十三人。問：㡬何丁出一兵？
術曰：列二萬三千六百九十二人，以五千九百二十三除之即得。
答曰： a 丁出 b 兵。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 丁 (people) are required to provide one 兵 (soldier). The problem states that there are 23,692 丁 and 5,923 兵. The calculation involves dividing the total number of 丁 by the total number of 兵.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_ding = 23692  # Total 丁
total_bing = 5923   # Total 兵

# Calculate how many 丁 are required to provide one 兵
a = Fraction(total_ding, total_bing)

# Output the result
a  # This represents how many 丁 are required to provide one 兵


"""


The variable `a` will store the result as a fraction, representing the number of 丁 required to provide one 兵.
"""


"""
Missing variable in output: 'b'"""
