今有外角聚粟下周四十八尺高六尺。問：粟㡬何？
術曰：列下周四十八尺，自相乘得二千三百四尺；以高六尺乘之得一萬三千八百二十四尺，以二十七除之得五百一十二尺。以斛法一尺六寸二分除之即得。
答曰： a斛 奇 b分 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the volume of a cone-shaped pile of grain, given its base circumference and height. The formula for the volume of a cone is:

\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
\]

However, in ancient Chinese mathematics, they used an approximation for the volume of a cone-like shape, which is:

\[
V = \frac{\text{base circumference}^2 \times \text{height}}{27}
\]

The result is then converted into units of "斛" (a unit of volume) and "分" (a fractional part of a "斛"). The conversion factor is given as \(1 \text{斛} = 1.62 \text{尺}^3\).

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
base_circumference = 48  # in 尺
height = 6  # in 尺
conversion_factor = Fraction(162, 100)  # 1.62 in fractional form

# Step 1: Compute the volume in cubic 尺
volume_cubic_chi = Fraction(base_circumference**2 * height, 27)

# Step 2: Convert the volume to 斛 and 分
a = volume_cubic_chi // conversion_factor  # Integer part (斛)
remainder = volume_cubic_chi % conversion_factor  # Remainder in cubic 尺
b = Fraction(remainder, conversion_factor) * 100  # Convert remainder to 分

# Final result
a = int(a)  # Convert to integer
b = int(b)  # Convert to integer


"""


After running this code, the variables `a` and `b` will contain the solution in terms of "斛" and "分".

Variable 'b' has wrong value. Expected: 8, Actual: 4"""
