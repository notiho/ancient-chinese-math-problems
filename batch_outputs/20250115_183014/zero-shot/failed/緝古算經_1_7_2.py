假令芻甍上袤三丈，下袤九丈，廣六丈，高一十二丈。有甲縣六百三十二人，乙縣二百四十三人。夏程人功當積三十六尺，限八日役。自穿築，二縣共造。今甲縣先到。問：自下給高、廣、袤、各多少？
求甲縣均給積尺受廣、袤，術曰：以程功乘乙縣人數，又以限日乘之，為積尺。以六因之，又高冪乘之，又袤差乘廣而一，所得又半之，為實。高乘上袤，袤差而一，為上袤之高。三因上袤之高，半之，為廉法，從。開立方除之，得乙高。以減甍高，余即甲高。求廣、袤，依率求之。
答曰：高 a丈 ，上廣 b丈 ，袤 c丈 。

To solve the problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the dimensions of a roof and distributing the workload between two counties. Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
upper_length = Fraction(3)  # 上袤 (upper length) in 丈
lower_length = Fraction(9)  # 下袤 (lower length) in 丈
width = Fraction(6)         # 廣 (width) in 丈
height = Fraction(12)       # 高 (height) in 丈
people_count_A = Fraction(632)  # 甲縣人數
people_count_B = Fraction(243)  # 乙縣人數
work_per_person = Fraction(36)  # 夏程人功當積 (work per person) in cubic 尺
days = Fraction(8)              # 限日 (days)

# Step 1: Calculate the total work for county B
total_work_B = work_per_person * people_count_B * days  # Total work in cubic 尺

# Step 2: Calculate the volume of the roof
volume = Fraction(1, 2) * width * height * (upper_length + lower_length)  # Volume in cubic 丈

# Step 3: Calculate the height contributed by county B
upper_height = height * upper_length / (upper_length + lower_length)  # 上袤之高 (upper height) in 丈
lower_height = height - upper_height  # 下袤之高 (lower height) in 丈
slope_length = Fraction(1, 2) * 3 * upper_height  # 廉法 (slope length) in 丈

# Convert total work to cubic 丈 (1 丈³ = 1000 尺³)
total_work_B_in_zhang = total_work_B / 1000

# Solve for the height contributed by county B
height_B = (total_work_B_in_zhang / slope_length) ** Fraction(1, 3)  # 乙高 (height for county B) in 丈
height_A = height - height_B  # 甲高 (height for county A) in 丈

# Step 4: Calculate the width and length contributed by county A
width_A = width  # 廣 (width) is the same for both counties
length_A = upper_length + lower_length - (upper_length * height_B / height)  # 袤 (length) for county A

# Assign the results to variables
a = height_A  # 高 (height) for county A in 丈
b = width_A   # 上廣 (upper width) in 丈
c = length_A  # 袤 (length) for county A in 丈

# Print the results
