今有蒲生一日，長三尺。莞生一日，長一尺。蒲生日自半。莞生日自倍。問︰幾何日而長等？
術曰：假令二日，不足一尺五寸。令之三日，有餘一尺七寸半。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰： a日 。各長 b尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the number of days (`a`) it takes for two plants, "蒲" and "莞," to grow to the same length, and the length (`b`) they reach when they are equal.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. "蒲" grows 3 feet per day but starts at half its daily growth on the first day.
2. "莞" grows 1 foot per day but starts at double its daily growth on the first day.
3. We are tasked to find the number of days (`a`) it takes for their lengths to be equal and the length (`b`) they reach.

### Python Code:

"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Growth rates and initial conditions
growth_pu = Fraction(3)  # 蒲 grows 3 feet per day
growth_guan = Fraction(1)  # 莞 grows 1 foot per day

# Initial growth adjustments
initial_pu = growth_pu / 2  # 蒲 starts at half its daily growth
initial_guan = growth_guan * 2  # 莞 starts at double its daily growth

# Total growth after `a` days
# Length of 蒲 after `a` days: initial_pu + (a - 1) * growth_pu
# Length of 莞 after `a` days: initial_guan + (a - 1) * growth_guan

# Set the lengths equal to solve for `a`
# initial_pu + (a - 1) * growth_pu = initial_guan + (a - 1) * growth_guan

a = (initial_guan - initial_pu) / (growth_pu - growth_guan) + 1

# Compute the length `b` when they are equal
b = initial_pu + (a - 1) * growth_pu

# Results
a = Fraction(a)  # Number of days
b = Fraction(b)  # Length in feet

# Outputs
a, b


"""


### Explanation:
1. We calculate the total length of each plant after `a` days.
2. We set the lengths equal to each other and solve for `a`.
3. Once `a` is determined, we substitute it back into the length formula to find `b`.

### Solution:
The variables `a` and `b` will contain the number of days and the length in feet, respectively.
