又有圭田廣五步、二分步之一，從八步、三分步之二。問：為田幾何？
術曰：半廣以乘正從。
荅曰： a步 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem describes a rectangular field (圭田) with a width (廣) of \( 5 + \frac{1}{2} \) steps and a length (正) of \( 8 + \frac{2}{3} \) steps. The area of the field is calculated as the product of the width and the length.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Define the width (廣) and length (正) in steps
width = Fraction(5) + Fraction(1, 2)  # 5 + 1/2
length = Fraction(8) + Fraction(2, 3)  # 8 + 2/3

# Calculate the area (田)
a = width * length  # 半廣以乘正從

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'
a  # Area in steps^2


"""


The variable `a` will contain the area of the field in steps².
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 143/6, Actual: 143/3"""
