今有東南望波口，立兩表南、北相去九丈，以索薄地連之。當北表之西卻行去表六丈，薄地遙望波口南岸，入索北端四丈二寸。以望北岸，入前所望表里一丈二尺。又卻後行去表一十三丈五尺。薄地遙望波口南岸，與南表參合。問波口廣幾何？
術曰：以後去表乘入索，如表相去而一。所得，以前去表減之，餘以為法；復以前去表減後去表，餘以乘入所望表里為實，實如法而一，得波口廣。
答曰： a里 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the width of a river mouth ("波口廣"), which is represented by the variable `a`. The calculations involve distances and proportions based on the given measurements.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
north_south_distance = Fraction(9)  # 南北相去九丈
first_north_distance = Fraction(6)  # 北表之西卻行去表六丈
first_south_rope = Fraction(4, 10)  # 入索北端四丈二寸 (4丈2寸 = 4.2丈 = 4 + 2/10)
first_north_rope = Fraction(12, 10)  # 入前所望表里一丈二尺 (1丈2尺 = 1.2丈 = 1 + 2/10)
second_north_distance = Fraction(135, 10)  # 卻後行去表一十三丈五尺 (13丈5尺 = 13.5丈 = 13 + 5/10)

# Step 1: Calculate the denominator (法)
denominator = (second_north_distance * first_south_rope) - (first_north_distance * north_south_distance)

# Step 2: Calculate the numerator (實)
numerator = (first_north_distance - second_north_distance) * first_north_rope

# Step 3: Calculate the width of the river mouth (波口廣)
a = numerator / denominator

# Result
a  # 波口廣 in 丈

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Data**: The problem provides distances in 丈 (zhang), 尺 (chi), and 寸 (cun). These are converted into fractions for precise calculations. Note that 1 丈 = 10 尺 and 1 尺 = 10 寸.
2. **Denominator (法)**: This is calculated as the product of the second distance from the north table and the first south rope, minus the product of the first north distance and the north-south distance.
3. **Numerator (實)**: This is calculated as the difference between the first and second north distances, multiplied by the first north rope.
4. **Result**: The width of the river mouth (`a`) is the numerator divided by the denominator.

The variable `a` will contain the width of the river mouth in 丈 as a `Fraction`.

Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 5/3, Actual: 5/27"""
