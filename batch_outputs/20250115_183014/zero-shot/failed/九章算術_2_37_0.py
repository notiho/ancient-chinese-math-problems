This problem involves dividing a total amount of money (576) among 78 bamboo items in such a way that there are two types of bamboo items: one type costs more per item, and the other type costs less per item. The problem is to determine how many of each type of bamboo items there are and their respective costs.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total money and total bamboo items
total_money = 576
total_items = 78

# Let the cost of the cheaper bamboo item be a and the cost of the more expensive bamboo item be b.
# Let the number of cheaper bamboo items be c and the number of more expensive bamboo items be d.

# Assume the cheaper bamboo item costs 7 money per item and the more expensive bamboo item costs 8 money per item.
a = 7  # cost of cheaper bamboo item
b = 8  # cost of more expensive bamboo item

# Solve for the number of each type of bamboo item
# 7c + 8d = 576 (total money)
# c + d = 78 (total items)

# Express d in terms of c using the second equation
# d = 78 - c

# Substitute d into the first equation
# 7c + 8(78 - c) = 576
# 7c + 624 - 8c = 576
# -c + 624 = 576
# -c = 576 - 624
# c = 48

c = 48  # number of cheaper bamboo items
d = total_items - c  # number of more expensive bamboo items
d = 30

# Verify the solution
# Total cost = 7c + 8d
assert 7 * c + 8 * d == total_money
# Total items = c + d
assert c + d == total_items

# Output the results
a = Fraction(7)  # cost of cheaper bamboo item
b = Fraction(8)  # cost of more expensive bamboo item
c = Fraction(c)  # number of cheaper bamboo items
d = Fraction(d)  # number of more expensive bamboo items


"""


The solution is:
- `a = 7` (cost of cheaper bamboo item in money per item)
- `b = 8` (cost of more expensive bamboo item in money per item)
- `c = 48` (number of cheaper bamboo items)
- `d = 30` (number of more expensive bamboo items)
