今有粟三斗少半升，欲為菽。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求菽、答、麻、麥，皆九之，十而一。
荅曰：為菽 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much "菽" (beans) can be obtained from "粟" (millet) given the conversion rate. The conversion rate is described as "九之，十而一," which means multiplying by 9 and dividing by 10.

The given amount of millet is "三斗少半升" (3斗 - 0.5升). Let's compute the result in Python:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given amount of 粟 (millet)
粟 = Fraction(3) - Fraction(1, 20)  # 1斗 = 10升, so 半升 = 1/20斗

# Conversion rate: multiply by 9 and divide by 10
a = 粟 * Fraction(9, 10)

# The result is in 斗 (dou)
a


"""


The variable `a` will hold the amount of "菽" (beans) in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 273/100, Actual: 531/200"""
