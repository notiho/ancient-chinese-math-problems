今有粟一十二萬八千九百四十斛九斗三合，出與人買絹一匹，直粟三斛五斗七升。問：絹幾何？
術曰：置粟一十二萬八千九百四十斛九斗三合為實，以三斛五斗七升為法，除之，得匹餘四十之所得，又以法除之，即得。
答曰： a匹 b丈 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many pieces of silk ("絹") can be bought with the given amount of grain ("粟"). The total amount of grain is 128,940斛9斗3合, and the price of one piece of silk is 3斛5斗7升. We will compute the number of silk pieces (a) and the remaining grain in terms of 丈 (b).

### Steps:
1. Convert all units of grain into a common unit (升).
   - 1斛 = 10斗
   - 1斗 = 10升
   - 1升 = 10合
2. Perform the division to find the number of silk pieces (a) and the remainder.
3. Convert the remainder back into 丈.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Convert all units to 升
total_grain = (128940 * 10 * 10) + (9 * 10) + 3  # Convert 128,940斛9斗3合 to 升
price_per_silk = (3 * 10 * 10) + (5 * 10) + 7    # Convert 3斛5斗7升 to 升

# Calculate the number of silk pieces (a) and the remainder
a = total_grain // price_per_silk  # Integer division to find the number of silk pieces
remainder = total_grain % price_per_silk  # Remainder in 升

# Convert the remainder back to 丈 (1丈 = 10升)
b = Fraction(remainder, 10)  # Convert 升 to 丈

# Results
a  # Number of silk pieces
b  # Remaining grain in 丈


"""


### Explanation of Variables:
- `a`: The number of silk pieces that can be bought.
- `b`: The remaining grain in 丈 after buying `a` pieces of silk.

You can run the code to compute the exact values of `a` and `b`.

Variable 'b' has wrong value. Expected: 18/5, Actual: 162/5"""
