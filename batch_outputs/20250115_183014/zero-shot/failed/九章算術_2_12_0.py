"""
今有粟五斗、太半升，欲為麻。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求菽、答、麻、麥，皆九之，十而一。
荅曰：為麻 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to compute how much 麻 (hemp) can be obtained from 粟 (millet). The rule states that to convert 粟 into 麻, we multiply by 9 and then divide by 10.

The given amount of 粟 is 5斗 and 太半升. 太半升 means "greater half of a 升," which is equivalent to 6/10 of a 升. Since 1斗 = 10升, the total amount of 粟 in terms of 升 is:

5斗 = 50升  
太半升 = 6/10升  

Thus, the total 粟 is:

50 + 6/10 升 = 50.6 升.

Now, we apply the conversion rule to find 麻:

麻 = (粟 × 9) / 10.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 粟 in terms of 升
粟 = Fraction(50) + Fraction(6, 10)

# Conversion to 麻
a = (粟 * 9) / 10

# Result
a  # 麻 in terms of 斗


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 麻 in terms of 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 114/25, Actual: 2277/50"""
