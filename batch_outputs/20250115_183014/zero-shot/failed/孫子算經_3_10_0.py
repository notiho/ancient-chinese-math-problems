今有粟，二千三百七十四斛，斛加三升。問：共粟幾何？
術曰：置粟二千三百七十四斛，以一斛三升乘之，即得。
答曰： a斛 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we will calculate the total amount of grain when each "斛" is increased by 3 "升". The total number of "斛" is 2374. Using the formula provided, we multiply the total number of "斛" by the amount of grain in each "斛" (1斛 + 3升). Since 1斛 = 10升, this means each "斛" is now 10升 + 3升 = 13升.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_hu = 2374  # Total number of "斛"
hu_to_sheng = 10  # 1斛 = 10升
additional_sheng = 3  # Additional 3升 per 斛

# Total grain calculation
a = total_hu * (hu_to_sheng + additional_sheng)  # Total grain in 升


"""


The solution is stored in the variable `a`, which represents the total amount of grain in "升".
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 122261/50, Actual: 30862"""
