今有人當稟粟二斛。倉無粟，欲與米一、菽二，以當所稟粟。問︰各幾何？
術曰：置米一、菽二求為粟之數。并之得三、九分之八，以為法。亦置米一、菽二，而以粟二斛乘之，各自為實。實如法得一斛。
荅曰：米 a斗 。菽 b斛 。

To solve this problem, we need to translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the values of "a" (米, rice in dou) and "b" (菽, beans in hu) such that they are equivalent to 2 hu of grain. Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
grain_equivalent = Fraction(2)  # 粟 2斛
rice_equivalent = Fraction(1)  # 米 1斗
beans_equivalent = Fraction(2)  # 菽 2斛

# Combine rice and beans into a single equivalent unit
combined_equivalent = rice_equivalent + beans_equivalent  # 米1 + 菽2
combined_equivalent = combined_equivalent / Fraction(3)  # Divide by 3 (as per the problem)

# Calculate the actual amount of rice and beans
a = grain_equivalent * rice_equivalent / combined_equivalent  # 米 a斗
b = grain_equivalent * beans_equivalent / combined_equivalent  # 菽 b斛

# Results
a  # 米 a斗
b  # 菽 b斛


"""


This code calculates the values of `a` (米, rice in dou) and `b` (菽, beans in hu) using the method described in the problem. The results are stored in the variables `a` and `b`.

Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 36/7, Actual: 2
Variable 'b' has wrong value. Expected: 36/35, Actual: 4"""
