今有米在十斗桶中，不知其數。滿中添粟而舂之，得米七斗。問︰故米幾何？
術曰：以盈不足術求之，假令故米二斗，不足二升。令之三斗，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰： a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we will use the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method). Here's the Python code to compute the value of the unknown "a" (the amount of rice in the bucket initially):


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data:
# Hypothesis 1: If the initial rice is 2斗, it is 2升 short.
# Hypothesis 2: If the initial rice is 3斗, it is 2升 excess.

# Convert all measurements to a consistent unit (升, where 1斗 = 10升):
# Hypothesis 1: 2斗 = 20升, short by 2升 -> total = 20升 + 2升 = 22升
# Hypothesis 2: 3斗 = 30升, excess by 2升 -> total = 30升 - 2升 = 28升

# Using the Excess and Deficiency Method:
# Excess = 2升, Deficiency = 2升
# Difference in assumed amounts = 3斗 - 2斗 = 1斗 = 10升
# Difference in results = 28升 - 22升 = 6升

# Compute the initial amount of rice:
a = Fraction(10, 6)  # 10升 difference in assumed amounts / 6升 difference in results
a = a * 2  # Multiply by the deficiency (or excess), which is 2升
a = a.limit_denominator()  # Simplify the fraction

# Convert back to 斗 (1斗 = 10升):
a = a / 10

# Result:
a  # The initial amount of rice in 斗


"""


The solution is stored in the variable `a`, which represents the initial amount of rice in the bucket in units of 斗.

"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 5/2, Actual: 1/3"""
