今有菽二斗，欲為豉。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以菽求豉，七之，五而一。
荅曰：為豉 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to compute the amount of 豉 (fermented beans) obtained from 2 斗 of 菽 (beans). The method described in the problem states: "七之，五而一," which means for every 7 parts of beans, 5 parts are lost, and 2 parts remain as 豉.

Here is the Python code to compute the value of "a" (the amount of 豉):


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
beans = 2  # in 斗

# Calculation
a = beans * Fraction(2, 7)  # For every 7 parts of beans, 2 parts remain as 豉

# Output the result
a  # a represents the amount of 豉 in 斗


"""


The value of `a` will be the amount of 豉 obtained, represented as a fraction of 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 14/5, Actual: 4/7"""
