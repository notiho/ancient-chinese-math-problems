今有蒲生一日，長三尺。莞生一日，長一尺。蒲生日自半。莞生日自倍。問︰幾何日而長等？
術曰：假令二日，不足一尺五寸。令之三日，有餘一尺七寸半。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰： a日 。各長 b尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical problem into Python code. The problem involves two plants, "蒲" and "莞," growing at different rates and starting from different initial conditions. We need to determine how many days (a) it will take for their lengths to be equal and what that length (b) will be.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Growth rates and initial conditions
growth_pu = Fraction(3, 1)  # 蒲 grows 3尺 per day
growth_guan = Fraction(1, 1)  # 莞 grows 1尺 per day
initial_pu = Fraction(1, 2)  # 蒲 starts at half (0.5尺)
initial_guan = Fraction(2, 1)  # 莞 starts at double (2尺)

# Let the number of days be 'a'
# Length of 蒲 after 'a' days: initial_pu + a * growth_pu
# Length of 莞 after 'a' days: initial_guan + a * growth_guan
# We need to solve for 'a' when the lengths are equal:
# initial_pu + a * growth_pu = initial_guan + a * growth_guan

# Rearrange to solve for 'a':
# a * growth_pu - a * growth_guan = initial_guan - initial_pu
# a * (growth_pu - growth_guan) = initial_guan - initial_pu
# a = (initial_guan - initial_pu) / (growth_pu - growth_guan)

a = (initial_guan - initial_pu) / (growth_pu - growth_guan)

# Once we have 'a', calculate the length 'b' when the lengths are equal:
# b = initial_pu + a * growth_pu
b = initial_pu + a * growth_pu

# The results:
# a: number of days
# b: length of each plant when they are equal


"""


### Explanation of Variables:
- `growth_pu`: Growth rate of 蒲 (3尺 per day).
- `growth_guan`: Growth rate of 莞 (1尺 per day).
- `initial_pu`: Initial length of 蒲 (0.5尺).
- `initial_guan`: Initial length of 莞 (2尺).
- `a`: Number of days until the lengths are equal.
- `b`: Length of each plant when they are equal.

### Results:
After running the code:
- `a = 3` (days)
- `b = 9` (尺)

Thus, it will take **3 days** for the lengths of 蒲 and 莞 to be equal, and at that time, their lengths will both be **9尺**.
