今有蒲生一日，長三尺。莞生一日，長一尺。蒲生日自半。莞生日自倍。問︰幾何日而長等？

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves determining the number of days (`a`) it takes for the lengths of two plants (蒲 and 莞) to become equal, and their respective lengths (`b`) at that time.

Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data:
# 蒲 grows 3尺 per day, starting at half its length
# 莞 grows 1尺 per day, starting at double its length
# We are solving for the number of days (a) when their lengths are equal, and the length (b) at that time.

# Using the 盈不足術 (Excess and Deficiency Method):
# Assume 2 days: 蒲 = 3尺/day * 2 days + 1/2尺 = 6尺 + 1/2尺 = 6.5尺
#                 莞 = 1尺/day * 2 days + 2尺 = 2尺 + 2尺 = 4尺
# Difference = 6.5尺 - 4尺 = 2.5尺 = 2尺5寸 (不足 1尺5寸)
# Assume 3 days: 蒲 = 3尺/day * 3 days + 1/2尺 = 9尺 + 1/2尺 = 9.5尺
#                 莞 = 1尺/day * 3 days + 2尺 = 3尺 + 2尺 = 5尺
# Difference = 9.5尺 - 5尺 = 4.5尺 = 4尺5寸 (有餘 1尺7寸半)

# 盈不足術 formula:
# a = (盈 * 不足) / (盈 - 不足)
盈 = Fraction(17, 10)  # 1尺7寸半 = 1 + 7/10 = 17/10
不足 = Fraction(15, 10)  # 1尺5寸 = 1 + 5/10 = 15/10
a = (盈 * 不足) / (盈 - 不足)

# Length at that time:
b = 3 * a + Fraction(1, 2)  # 蒲's length (same as 莞's length at that time)

# Results:
a = a  # Number of days
b = b  # Length in 尺

# Output the results
a, b

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - 蒲 grows 3尺 per day, starting at half its length (0.5尺).
   - 莞 grows 1尺 per day, starting at double its length (2尺).
   - We need to find the number of days (`a`) when their lengths are equal, and their respective lengths (`b`) at that time.

2. **Using the 盈不足術 (Excess and Deficiency Method)**:
   - We calculate the difference in lengths for assumed days (2 days and 3 days).
   - Using these differences (盈 and 不足), we apply the formula to find `a`.

3. **Calculating the Length (`b`)**:
   - Once `a` is determined, we use the growth formula for 蒲 (or 莞, since their lengths are equal at that time) to calculate `b`.

4. **Output**:
   - The results are stored in variables `a` (number of days) and `b` (length in 尺).

### Results:
The code will compute the values of `a` and `b` using the given data and method.
