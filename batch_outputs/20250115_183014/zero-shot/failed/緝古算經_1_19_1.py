假令有股十六二分之一，句弦相乘冪一百六十四二十五分之十四。問：句多少？
術曰：冪自乘，為實。股自乘，為方法，從。開方除之，所得又開方，即句。
答曰：句 a 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical problem into Python code. Here's the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction
import math

# Given values
g = Fraction(16, 1) + Fraction(1, 2)  # 股 (g) = 16 1/2
m = Fraction(164, 1) + Fraction(14, 25)  # 冪 (m) = 164 14/25

# Calculations
g_squared = g * g  # 股自乘 (g^2)
m_squared = m * m  # 冪自乘 (m^2)

# Divide m^2 by g^2
result = m_squared / g_squared

# Take the square root of the result to find 句 (a)
a = math.sqrt(result)

# Convert to Fraction for exact representation
a = Fraction(a).limit_denominator()

# The value of 句 (a) is now stored in the variable `a`


"""


The variable `a` will contain the solution for 句. Note that the square root operation is approximated in Python, so the result is converted back to a `Fraction` for exact representation.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 44/5, Actual: 748/75"""
