今有稟粟五斛，五人分之，欲令三人得三，二人得二。問︰各幾何？
術曰：置三人，人三；二人，人二，為列衰。副并為法。以五斛乘未并者，各自為實。實如法得一斛。
荅曰： a人 ，人得 b斛 。 c人 ，人得 d斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, let's translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. Here's the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total grain in hu (斛)
total_grain = 5  # in hu

# Number of people
three_people = 3
two_people = 2

# Total people
total_people = three_people + two_people

# Total grain divided by total people
grain_per_person = Fraction(total_grain, total_people)

# Grain for three people
a = three_people
b = grain_per_person * three_people  # in hu

# Grain for two people
c = two_people
d = grain_per_person * two_people * 10  # convert hu to dou (1 hu = 10 dou)

# Results
a, b, c, d


"""


The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` represent the solution:

- `a`: Number of people in the first group (3 people).
- `b`: Grain each person in the first group gets (in hu).
- `c`: Number of people in the second group (2 people).
- `d`: Grain each person in the second group gets (in dou).

Variable 'b' has wrong value. Expected: 15/13, Actual: 3
Variable 'd' has wrong value. Expected: 100/13, Actual: 20"""
