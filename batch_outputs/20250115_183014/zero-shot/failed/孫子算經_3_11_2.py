今有粟，三十六萬九千九百八十斛七斗，在倉九年，年斛耗三升。問：一年、九年各耗幾何？
術曰：置三十六萬九千九百八十斛七斗，以三升乘之，得一年之耗，又以九乘之，即九年之耗。
答曰： a年 耗 b斛 ， c年 耗 d斛 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will calculate the amount of grain lost in one year and nine years. The total amount of grain is given as 369,980斛7斗, and the annual loss is 3升 per斛. First, we need to convert the total amount into a consistent unit (升), perform the calculations, and then convert the results back into appropriate units (斛 and斗).

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Conversion factors
斛_to_斗 = 10  # 1斛 = 10斗
斗_to_升 = 10  # 1斗 = 10升

# Total grain in 斛 and 斗
total_grain_斛 = 369980
total_grain_斗 = 7

# Convert total grain to 升
total_grain_升 = total_grain_斛 * 斛_to_斗 * 斗_to_升 + total_grain_斗 * 斗_to_升

# Annual loss per 斛 in 升
annual_loss_per_斛_升 = 3

# Calculate total annual loss in 升
a = total_grain_斛 * annual_loss_per_斛_升

# Calculate total nine-year loss in 升
b = a * 9

# Convert losses back to 斛 and 斗
a_斛 = a // (斛_to_斗 * 斗_to_升)
a_斗 = (a % (斛_to_斗 * 斗_to_升)) // 斗_to_升
a_升 = a % 斗_to_升

b_斛 = b // (斛_to_斗 * 斗_to_升)
b_斗 = (b % (斛_to_斗 * 斗_to_升)) // 斗_to_升
b_升 = b % 斗_to_升

# Final answers
a = (a_斛, a_斗, a_升)  # One-year loss in (斛, 斗, 升)
b = (b_斛, b_斗, b_升)  # Nine-year loss in (斛, 斗, 升)

# Results
a, b


"""


This code calculates the one-year and nine-year losses in terms of 斛, 斗, and 升. The results are stored in variables `a` and `b`, where each is a tuple representing the loss in (斛, 斗, 升).
