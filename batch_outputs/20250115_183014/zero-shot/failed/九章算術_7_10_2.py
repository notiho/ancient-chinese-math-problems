今有蒲生一日，長三尺。莞生一日，長一尺。蒲生日自半。莞生日自倍。問︰幾何日而長等？
術曰：假令二日，不足一尺五寸。令之三日，有餘一尺七寸半。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰： a日 。各長 b尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves two plants, "蒲" and "莞", growing at different rates and starting from different initial conditions. We need to determine how many days it takes for their lengths to become equal and what that length is.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Growth rates and initial conditions
growth_rate_pu = Fraction(3, 1)  # 蒲 grows 3尺 per day
growth_rate_guan = Fraction(1, 1)  # 莞 grows 1尺 per day
initial_length_pu = Fraction(1, 2)  # 蒲 starts at 0.5尺
initial_length_guan = Fraction(2, 1)  # 莞 starts at 2尺

# Let the number of days be 'a'
# Length of 蒲 after 'a' days: initial_length_pu + a * growth_rate_pu
# Length of 莞 after 'a' days: initial_length_guan + a * growth_rate_guan
# We solve for when their lengths are equal:
# initial_length_pu + a * growth_rate_pu = initial_length_guan + a * growth_rate_guan

# Rearrange to solve for 'a':
# a * (growth_rate_pu - growth_rate_guan) = initial_length_guan - initial_length_pu
a = (initial_length_guan - initial_length_pu) / (growth_rate_pu - growth_rate_guan)

# Calculate the common length 'b' when their lengths are equal:
b = initial_length_pu + a * growth_rate_pu

# Results
a  # Number of days
b  # Common length in 尺


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. We use the `Fraction` class to handle fractional values precisely.
2. The growth rates and initial lengths of "蒲" and "莞" are defined.
3. We set up the equation for when their lengths are equal and solve for the number of days (`a`).
4. Once `a` is determined, we calculate the common length (`b`) using the growth formula for either plant.

### Solution:
- `a` is the number of days it takes for the lengths to become equal.
- `b` is the common length in 尺 when their lengths are equal.
