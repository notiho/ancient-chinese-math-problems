又有圭田廣五步、二分步之一，從八步、三分步之二。問：為田幾何？
術曰：半廣以乘正從。
荅曰： a步 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the area of a rectangular field (圭田). The width (廣) is given as \(5\) steps plus \( \frac{1}{2} \) step, and the length (正) is \(8\) steps plus \( \frac{2}{3} \) step. The formula to calculate the area is:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length}
\]

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Width (廣)
width = 5 + Fraction(1, 2)  # 5 steps + 1/2 step

# Length (正)
length = 8 + Fraction(2, 3)  # 8 steps + 2/3 step

# Area (田)
a = width * length  # Area = Width * Length

# The result is stored in the variable 'a'


"""


The variable `a` will contain the area of the field in steps squared.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 143/6, Actual: 143/3"""
