今有出錢二千三百七十，買布九匹二丈七尺。欲匹率之，問︰匹幾何？
經術術曰：以所求率乘錢數為實，以所買率為法，實如法得一。
荅曰：一匹， a錢

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of one匹 (one bolt of cloth). The given data is:

- Total money spent: 2370錢
- Total cloth purchased: 9匹 and 2丈7尺

We first need to convert the total cloth into a single unit (丈 or 尺). Assuming 1匹 = 10丈 and 1丈 = 10尺, the total cloth in 尺 is:

\[
\text{Total cloth in 尺} = (9 \times 10 \times 10) + (2 \times 10) + 7 = 9000 + 20 + 7 = 9027 \text{尺}.
\]

Now, the cost per匹 can be calculated by dividing the total money by the total cloth in匹. Since 1匹 = 10丈 = 100尺, the total cloth in匹 is:

\[
\text{Total cloth in 匹} = \frac{9027}{100} = 90.27 \text{匹}.
\]

The cost per匹 is:

\[
\text{Cost per 匹} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Total cloth in 匹}} = \frac{2370}{90.27}.
\]

Here is the Python code to compute the value of \( a \) (cost per匹):


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_money = 2370  # in 錢
total_cloth_in_chi = (9 * 10 * 10) + (2 * 10) + 7  # in 尺
total_cloth_in_pi = Fraction(total_cloth_in_chi, 100)  # Convert 尺 to 匹

# Calculate cost per 匹
a = Fraction(total_money, total_cloth_in_pi)

# Result
a  # Cost per 匹 in 錢


"""


The value of \( a \) will be the cost per匹 in錢.
