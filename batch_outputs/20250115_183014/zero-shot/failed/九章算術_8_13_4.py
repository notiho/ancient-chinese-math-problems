今有白禾二步、青禾三步、黃禾四步、黑禾五步，實各不滿斗。白取青、黃，青取黃、黑，黃取黑、白，黑取白、青，各一步，而實滿斗。問︰白、青、黃、黑禾實一步各幾何？
術曰：如方程，各置所取，以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：白禾 a步 實 b斗 ，青禾 c步 實 d斗 ，黃禾 e步 實 f斗 ，黑禾 g步 實 h斗 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical problem into Python code. The problem involves determining the actual quantities of grains (in "斗") for each type of grain (白禾, 青禾, 黃禾, 黑禾) based on the given steps and constraints.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Define the steps for each type of grain
white_steps = 2
green_steps = 3
yellow_steps = 4
black_steps = 5

# Define the equations based on the problem
# Each grain takes one step from two other grains to fill one "斗"
# Let a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h represent the unknowns
# a = white_steps, b = white斗
# c = green_steps, d = green斗
# e = yellow_steps, f = yellow斗
# g = black_steps, h = black斗

# The system of equations is:
# b + d + f = 1 (white takes from green and yellow)
# d + f + h = 1 (green takes from yellow and black)
# f + h + b = 1 (yellow takes from black and white)
# h + b + d = 1 (black takes from white and green)

# Solve the system of equations
# Using substitution or elimination method
# From the equations:
# b + d + f = 1
# d + f + h = 1
# f + h + b = 1
# h + b + d = 1

# Express each variable in terms of others
b = Fraction(1, 4)  # white斗
d = Fraction(1, 4)  # green斗
f = Fraction(1, 4)  # yellow斗
h = Fraction(1, 4)  # black斗

# Assign the steps to the variables
a = white_steps
c = green_steps
e = yellow_steps
g = black_steps

# Print the results
print("白禾 a步 實 b斗:", a, "步", b, "斗")
print("青禾 c步 實 d斗:", c, "步", d, "斗")
print("黃禾 e步 實 f斗:", e, "步", f, "斗")
print("黑禾 g步 實 h斗:", g, "步", h, "斗")


"""


### Explanation:
1. The problem is represented as a system of linear equations where each grain contributes to the total of 1 "斗" by taking from two other grains.
2. Using the symmetry of the equations, we deduce that each grain contributes equally, resulting in \( \frac{1}{4} \) "斗" for each grain.
3. The steps for each grain are given in the problem, and the solution is computed accordingly.

### Output:
```
白禾 a步 實 b斗: 2 步 1/4 斗
青禾 c步 實 d斗: 3 步 1/4 斗
黃禾 e步 實 f斗: 4 步 1/4 斗
黑禾 g步 實 h斗: 5 步 1/4 斗
```
