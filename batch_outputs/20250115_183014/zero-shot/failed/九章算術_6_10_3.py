今有惡粟二十斗，舂之，得糲米九斗。今欲求粺米十斗，問︰惡粟幾何？
術曰：置糲米九斗，以九乘之，為法。亦置粺米十斗，以十乘之，又以惡粟二十斗乘之，為實。實如法得一斗。
荅曰： a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the amount of "惡粟" (a type of grain) required to produce 10斗 of "粺米" (refined rice), given that 20斗 of "惡粟" produces 9斗 of "糲米" (coarse rice).

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
糲米 = 9  # 9斗 of coarse rice
粺米 = 10  # 10斗 of refined rice
惡粟 = 20  # 20斗 of grain produces 9斗 of coarse rice

# Calculation
a = Fraction(惡粟 * 粺米, 糲米)

# The result
a斗 = a  # Amount of grain required to produce 10斗 of refined rice


"""


The solution is stored in the variable `a斗`.

"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 2000/81, Actual: 200/9"""
