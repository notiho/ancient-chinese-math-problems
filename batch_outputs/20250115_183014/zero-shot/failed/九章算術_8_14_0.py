今有甲禾二秉、乙禾三秉、丙禾四秉，重皆過於石。甲二重如乙一，乙三重如丙一，丙四重如甲一。問︰甲、乙、丙禾一秉各重幾何？
術曰：如方程，置重過於石之物為負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：甲禾 a秉 重 b石 ，乙禾 c秉 重 d石 ，丙禾 e秉 重 f石 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves determining the weights of three types of grain (甲, 乙, 丙) in terms of "石" (a unit of weight). The relationships between their weights are given, and we will solve for the unknowns.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Relationships between the weights:
# 甲二重如乙一: 2 * weight_甲 = 1 * weight_乙
# 乙三重如丙一: 3 * weight_乙 = 1 * weight_丙
# 丙四重如甲一: 4 * weight_丙 = 1 * weight_甲

# Let the weights of 甲, 乙, 丙 be a, b, c respectively.
# Solve the equations step by step.

# Step 1: Express weights in terms of one variable.
# From 2 * a = b, we get b = 2 * a.
# From 3 * b = c, we get c = 3 * b = 3 * (2 * a) = 6 * a.
# From 4 * c = a, we get a = 4 * c = 4 * (6 * a).

# Step 2: Solve for a.
# Substitute c = 6 * a into 4 * c = a:
# 4 * (6 * a) = a
# 24 * a = a
# a = 1 (weight of 甲 in 石)

# Step 3: Solve for b and c using a = 1.
a = Fraction(1)  # weight of 甲 in 石
b = 2 * a        # weight of 乙 in 石
c = 6 * a        # weight of 丙 in 石

# Assign the results to the variables.
甲 = a
乙 = b
丙 = c

# Print the results.
print(f"甲禾一秉重 {甲} 石")
print(f"乙禾一秉重 {乙} 石")
print(f"丙禾一秉重 {丙} 石")


"""


### Explanation of the Solution:
1. The problem provides proportional relationships between the weights of the grains:
   - 2 times the weight of 甲 equals the weight of 乙.
   - 3 times the weight of 乙 equals the weight of 丙.
   - 4 times the weight of 丙 equals the weight of 甲.
2. By substituting these relationships, we express all weights in terms of one variable (a).
3. Solving the equations step by step, we find the weight of 甲 (a), and then calculate the weights of 乙 (b) and 丙 (c).
4. The results are stored in variables `甲`, `乙`, and `丙`.

### Output:
```
甲禾一秉重 1 石
乙禾一秉重 2 石
丙禾一秉重 6 石
```
