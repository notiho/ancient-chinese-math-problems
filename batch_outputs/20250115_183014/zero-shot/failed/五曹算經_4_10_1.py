今有半壁聚粟下周三十六尺高四尺五寸。問：粟㡬何？
術曰：列下周三十六尺自相乘得一千二百九十六尺以高四尺五寸乘之得五千八百三十二尺以十八除之得三百二十四尺以斛法一尺六寸二分除之即得。
答曰： a斛 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the volume of a half-spherical pile of grain and converting it into a unit called "斛". Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
diameter = 36  # 下周 (circumference of the base) in 尺
height = Fraction(4, 1) + Fraction(5, 10)  # 高 (height) in 尺 (4尺5寸 = 4 + 5/10 尺)
conversion_factor = Fraction(16, 10) + Fraction(2, 100)  # 1斛 = 1尺6寸2分 = 1 + 6/10 + 2/100 尺³

# Step 1: Calculate the radius of the base
radius = diameter / 2  # 半径 (radius) in 尺

# Step 2: Calculate the volume of the half-sphere
# Volume of a sphere = (4/3) * π * r³
# Volume of a half-sphere = (1/2) * (4/3) * π * r³
# Using the approximation π = 3 (as was common in ancient Chinese mathematics)
volume_half_sphere = Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(4, 3) * 3 * radius**2 * height  # in 尺³

# Step 3: Convert the volume into 斛
a = volume_half_sphere / conversion_factor  # in 斛

# Output the result
a


"""


The variable `a` will contain the answer in terms of "斛".

"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 200, Actual: 1799.9999999999998"""
