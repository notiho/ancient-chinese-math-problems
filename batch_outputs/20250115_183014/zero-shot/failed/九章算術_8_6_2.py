今有牛五、羊二，直金十兩。牛二、羊五直金八兩。問︰牛羊各直金幾何？
術曰：如方程。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：牛 a ，直金 b兩 ，羊 c ，直金 d兩 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves solving a system of linear equations to determine the value of the unknowns. Here's how we can compute it:

The problem can be represented as:
1. \( 5a + 2c = 10 \)
2. \( 2a + 5c = 8 \)

Where:
- \( a \) is the number of cows.
- \( b \) is the price of one cow in gold (兩).
- \( c \) is the number of sheep.
- \( d \) is the price of one sheep in gold (兩).

We will solve for \( b \) and \( d \).

# Define the equations

# 2b + 5d = 8

# Solve for b and d using substitution or elimination
# Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second by 5 to align coefficients of b
# 10b + 4d = 20
# 10b + 25d = 40

# Subtract the first modified equation from the second
# 21d = 20 - 16
# d = 20/21

# Substitute d back into one of the original equations to solve for b
# 5b + 2(20/21) = 10
# 5b + 40/21 = 10
# 5b = 10 - 40/21
# 5b = 210/21 - 40/21
