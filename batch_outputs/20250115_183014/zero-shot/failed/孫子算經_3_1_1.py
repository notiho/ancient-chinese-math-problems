今有丁一千五百萬，出兵四十萬。問：幾丁科一兵？
術曰：置丁一千五百萬為實，以兵四十萬為法，實如法，即得。
答曰： a 丁 b分 。
"""

"""
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many "丁" (a unit of population or resources) are required for one "兵" (a soldier). The problem states that there are 15,000,000 丁 and 400,000 兵. The solution involves dividing the total 丁 by the total 兵.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_ding = 15000000  # 丁
total_bing = 400000    # 兵

# Calculate 丁 per 兵
a = Fraction(total_ding, total_bing)

# Result
a_ding_per_bing = a  # 丁 per 兵


"""


The variable `a_ding_per_bing` will contain the answer as a fraction in 丁 per 兵.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 37, Actual: 75/2
Missing variable in output: 'b'"""
