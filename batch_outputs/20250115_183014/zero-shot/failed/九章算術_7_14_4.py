今有漆三得油四，油四和漆五。今有漆三斗，欲令分以易油，還自和餘漆。問︰出漆、得油、和漆各幾何？
術曰：假令出漆九升，不足六升。令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰：出漆 a斗 ，得油 b斗 ，和漆 c斗 ， d升 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves determining the quantities of lacquer (漆) and oil (油) exchanged and remaining after a transaction. We'll use the `Fraction` class to ensure precise calculations.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
rate_lacquer_to_oil = Fraction(3, 4)  # 3 units of lacquer get 4 units of oil
rate_oil_to_lacquer = Fraction(4, 5)  # 4 units of oil get 5 units of lacquer

# Initial lacquer quantity
initial_lacquer = Fraction(3, 1)  # 3斗 of lacquer

# Step 1: Determine how much lacquer is exchanged
# Using the "盈不足術" (excess and deficiency method):
# Assume the lacquer exchanged is 1斗2升 = 1斗 + 2升 = 1 + 2/10 = 1.2斗
exchanged_lacquer = Fraction(12, 10)  # 1斗2升 = 12/10斗

# Step 2: Determine the oil received for the exchanged lacquer
received_oil = exchanged_lacquer * rate_lacquer_to_oil  # oil received = lacquer exchanged * rate

# Step 3: Determine the remaining lacquer after the exchange
remaining_lacquer = initial_lacquer - exchanged_lacquer

# Step 4: Add the lacquer obtained by exchanging the received oil back into lacquer
# Oil exchanged back to lacquer
lacquer_from_oil = received_oil * rate_oil_to_lacquer

# Final lacquer quantity after adding back
final_lacquer = remaining_lacquer + lacquer_from_oil

# Results
a = exchanged_lacquer  # Lacquer exchanged
b = received_oil       # Oil received
c = final_lacquer.numerator // final_lacquer.denominator  # Final lacquer in 斗
d = (final_lacquer - c) * 10  # Remaining lacquer in 升

# Convert d to an integer for clarity
d = int(d)

# Output variables
a, b, c, d


"""


### Explanation of Variables:
- `a`: The amount of lacquer exchanged (in 斗).
- `b`: The amount of oil received (in 斗).
- `c`: The final amount of lacquer (in 斗).
- `d`: The remaining lacquer (in 升).

### Final Answer:
The solution will compute the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` based on the given rates and initial quantities.
