今有粟，三十六萬九千九百八十斛七斗，在倉九年，年斛耗三升。問：一年、九年各耗幾何？
術曰：置三十六萬九千九百八十斛七斗，以三升乘之，得一年之耗，又以九乘之，即九年之耗。
答曰： a年 耗 b斛 ， c年 耗 d斛 。

"""
To solve this problem, let's translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. We'll calculate the amount of grain lost in one year and nine years due to the specified rate of loss.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_grain = Fraction(3699807, 10)  # 369980斛7斗 converted to a single unit (斛)
loss_per_year = Fraction(3, 10)  # 3升 converted to a single unit (斛)

# Calculations
a = 1  # One year
b = a * loss_per_year  # Loss in one year

c = 9  # Nine years
d = c * loss_per_year  # Loss in nine years

# Results
a, b, c, d


"""


Explanation:
1. The total grain is given as 369980斛7斗. Since 1斗 = 1/10斛, we convert this to a single unit (斛) as `369980 + 7/10 = 3699807/10`.
2. The loss per year is given as 3升. Since 1升 = 1/10斗 = 1/100斛, we convert this to a single unit (斛) as `3/10`.
3. We calculate the loss for one year (`b`) by multiplying the loss per year by 1.
4. We calculate the loss for nine years (`d`) by multiplying the loss per year by 9.

The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` store the results:
- `a` is the number of years for the first calculation (1 year).
- `b` is the loss in 1 year (斛).
- `c` is the number of years for the second calculation (9 years).
- `d` is the loss in 9 years (斛).
