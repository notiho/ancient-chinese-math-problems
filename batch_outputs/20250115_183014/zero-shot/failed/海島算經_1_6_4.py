今有望清淵，淵下有白石。偃矩岸上，令句高三尺。斜望水岸，入下股四尺五寸。望白石，入下股二尺四寸。又設重矩于上，其間相去四尺。更從句端斜望水岸，入上股四尺。以望白石，入上股二尺二寸。問水深幾何？
術曰：置望水上下股相減，餘以乘望石上股為上率。又以望石上下股相減，餘以乘望水上股為下率。兩率相減，餘以乘矩間為實；以二差相乘為法。實如法而一，得水深。
答曰： a丈 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the depth of water using given measurements and relationships. Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
gou_high = Fraction(3)  # The height of the gou (3尺)
lower_gou_to_water_edge = Fraction(4, 1) + Fraction(5, 10)  # 4尺5寸 = 4 + 5/10
lower_gou_to_white_stone = Fraction(2, 1) + Fraction(4, 10)  # 2尺4寸 = 2 + 4/10
distance_between_gou = Fraction(4)  # Distance between the two gou (4尺)
upper_gou_to_water_edge = Fraction(4)  # Upper gou to water edge (4尺)
upper_gou_to_white_stone = Fraction(2, 1) + Fraction(2, 10)  # 2尺2寸 = 2 + 2/10

# Calculations
upper_rate = (upper_gou_to_water_edge - lower_gou_to_water_edge) * upper_gou_to_white_stone
lower_rate = (upper_gou_to_white_stone - lower_gou_to_white_stone) * upper_gou_to_water_edge

difference = upper_rate - lower_rate
product_of_differences = (upper_gou_to_water_edge - lower_gou_to_water_edge) * (upper_gou_to_white_stone - lower_gou_to_white_stone)

a = (difference * distance_between_gou) / product_of_differences

# The depth of the water
print(f"The depth of the water is: {a} 丈")


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Variables and Units**:
   - The measurements are converted into fractions to maintain precision, as some values are given in 尺 (chi) and 寸 (cun), where 1 尺 = 10 寸.
   - `gou_high` represents the height of the gou (3 尺).
   - Other variables represent distances in 尺 and 寸.

2. **Formulas**:
   - The upper rate and lower rate are calculated using the differences in the measurements and the given relationships.
   - The depth of the water (`a`) is computed using the formula provided in the problem.

3. **Output**:
   - The result is printed in 丈 (zhang), which is the unit for the depth of the water.

This code directly implements the ancient mathematical method described in the problem.
