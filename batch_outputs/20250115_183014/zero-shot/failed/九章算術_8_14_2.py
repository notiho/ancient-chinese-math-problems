今有甲禾二秉、乙禾三秉、丙禾四秉，重皆過於石。甲二重如乙一，乙三重如丙一，丙四重如甲一。問︰甲、乙、丙禾一秉各重幾何？
術曰：如方程，置重過於石之物為負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：甲禾 a秉 重 b石 ，乙禾 c秉 重 d石 ，丙禾 e秉 重 f石 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical problem into Python code. The problem involves determining the weights of three types of grain (甲, 乙, 丙) based on their relationships. The relationships are as follows:

1. The weight of 2 units of 甲 equals the weight of 1 unit of 乙.
2. The weight of 3 units of 乙 equals the weight of 1 unit of 丙.
3. The weight of 4 units of 丙 equals the weight of 1 unit of 甲.

We will use the `Fraction` class to ensure precise calculations for fractional values.


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Relationships between the weights
# Let the weight of 1 unit of 甲 be a, 乙 be b, and 丙 be c (in 石).
# From the problem:
# 2a = b
# 3b = c
# 4c = a

# Solve for a, b, and c:
# From 2a = b, we get b = 2a.
# From 3b = c, we get c = 3b = 3(2a) = 6a.
# From 4c = a, we get a = 4c = 4(6a) = 24a.
# Simplify to find a, b, and c.

# Let a = 1 (as a reference unit), then:
a = Fraction(1)  # Weight of 甲 in 石
b = 2 * a        # Weight of 乙 in 石
c = 6 * a        # Weight of 丙 in 石

# Output the results
print("甲禾一秉重:", a, "石")
print("乙禾一秉重:", b, "石")
print("丙禾一秉重:", c, "石")


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. We start by defining the relationships between the weights of 甲, 乙, and 丙 using the equations provided in the problem.
2. Using substitution, we express the weights of 乙 and 丙 in terms of 甲.
3. We assign a reference value of 1 to the weight of 甲 (a = 1) and calculate the corresponding weights of 乙 and 丙.
4. The results are printed in terms of 石 (a traditional Chinese unit of weight).

### Results:
- 甲禾一秉重: 1 石
- 乙禾一秉重: 2 石
- 丙禾一秉重: 6 石
