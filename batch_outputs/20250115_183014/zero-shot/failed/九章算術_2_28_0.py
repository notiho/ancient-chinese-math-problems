"""
今有菽二斗，欲為豉。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以菽求豉，七之，五而一。
荅曰：為豉 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much 豉 (fermented soybean product) can be made from 2 斗 of 菽 (soybeans). The method provided states: "以菽求豉，七之，五而一," which means for every 7 parts of soybeans, 5 parts of 豉 are produced.

Here is the Python code to compute the value of "a":


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
soybeans = Fraction(2)  # 2 斗 of soybeans

# Conversion ratio: for every 7 parts of soybeans, 5 parts of 豉 are produced
a = soybeans * Fraction(5, 7)  # Calculate the amount of 豉 produced

# Result
a  # a is the amount of 豉 in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will hold the amount of 豉 produced in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 14/5, Actual: 10/7"""
