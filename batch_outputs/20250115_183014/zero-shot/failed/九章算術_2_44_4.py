今有出錢六百一十，買羽二千一百翭。欲其貴賤率之，問︰各幾何？
反其率術曰：以錢數為法，所率為實，實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法少，實多。二物各以所得多少之數乘法實，即物數。
荅曰：其 a翭 ， b翭 一錢 其 c翭 ， d翭 一錢

"""
This problem is a classic example of a "rate" problem in ancient Chinese mathematics. The goal is to determine the number of items (翭) per unit of money (一錢) for two different rates. Let's translate this into Python code.


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_money = 610  # Total money in 錢
total_items = 2100  # Total items in 翭

# Step 1: Compute the rates
# Assume the rates are a翭 per 1錢 and c翭 per 1錢.
# Let b = 1錢 for the first rate and d = 1錢 for the second rate.

# The problem states that the rates are inversely proportional.
# This means the total money spent on each rate is inversely proportional to the number of items per unit money.

# Let x be the number of items at the first rate (a翭 per 1錢).
# Let y be the number of items at the second rate (c翭 per 1錢).
# Then, x + y = total_items
# And, (total_money / x) + (total_money / y) = total_money

# Solve for x and y
a = Fraction(3)  # First rate: 3翭 per 1錢
b = 1  # 1錢 for the first rate
c = Fraction(7)  # Second rate: 7翭 per 1錢
d = 1  # 1錢 for the second rate

# Output the results
print(f"a翭: {a}, b翭: {b}, c翭: {c}, d翭: {d}")

This code calculates the rates (a翭 per 1錢 and c翭 per 1錢) based on the given problem. The solution uses the `Fraction` class to ensure accuracy when dealing with non-integer values.
