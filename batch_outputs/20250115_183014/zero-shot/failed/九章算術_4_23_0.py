又有積一萬六千四百四十八億六千六百四十三萬七千五百尺。問︰為立圓徑幾何？
開立圓術曰：置積尺數，以十六乘之，九而一，所得開立方除之，即丸徑。
荅曰： a尺 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to compute the diameter of a sphere (立圓徑) given its volume (積). The formula provided in the problem is:

1. Multiply the volume by 16.
2. Divide the result by 9.
3. Take the cube root of the result.
4. The result is the diameter of the sphere.

Here is the Python code to compute the value of `a`:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given volume in cubic 尺
volume = 1644866437500  # 1萬6千4百4十8億6千6百4十3萬7千5百尺

# Step 1: Multiply the volume by 16
step1 = volume * 16

# Step 2: Divide the result by 9
step2 = Fraction(step1, 9)

# Step 3: Take the cube root of the result
# Cube root of a Fraction can be approximated as follows:
a = step2 ** Fraction(1, 3)

# The diameter of the sphere is stored in variable `a`


"""


The variable `a` will contain the diameter of the sphere in 尺. Note that the cube root operation is approximated using `Fraction(1, 3)` for precision.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 14300, Actual: 14299.999999999993"""
