今有粟二斗三升，欲為糲飯。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求糲飯，三之，二而一。
荅曰：為糲飯 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem states that we have 2斗3升 of 粟 (grain) and want to calculate how much 糲飯 (coarse rice) can be made. The method described is to multiply the 粟 by 3 and divide by 2.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 粟 quantity in terms of 斗 and 升
粟_斗 = 2
粟_升 = 3

# Convert 粟 to a single unit (升), assuming 1斗 = 10升
粟_total_升 = 粟_斗 * 10 + 粟_升

# Calculate 糲飯 using the formula: 粟 * 3 / 2
糲飯_total_升 = Fraction(粟_total_升 * 3, 2)

# Convert back to 斗 and 升
a_斗 = 糲飯_total_升 // 10  # Whole number of 斗
a_升 = 糲飯_total_升 % 10   # Remaining 升

# Final result
a = (a_斗, a_升)  # Representing the result as (斗, 升)


"""


The variable `a` will contain the result in terms of 斗 and 升.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 69/20, Actual: (3, Fraction(9, 2))"""
