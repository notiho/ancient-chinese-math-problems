今有五家共井，甲二綆不足，如乙一綆；乙三綆不足，如丙一綆；丙四綆不足，如丁一綆；丁五綆不足，如戊一綆；戊六綆不足，如甲一綆。如各得所不足一綆，皆逮。問︰井深、綆長各幾何？
術曰：如方程，以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：井深 a丈 。甲綆長 b丈 ，乙綆長 c丈 ，丙綆長 d丈 ，丁綆長 e丈 ，戊綆長 f尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves a system of equations based on the relationships between the lengths of the ropes (綆) and the depth of the well (井深). We'll use the `Fraction` class to handle fractional values.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Let the depth of the well be 'a' (in 丈), and the rope lengths be 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', and 'f' (in 丈 for b, c, d, e, and 尺 for f).
# Convert 尺 to 丈 where necessary (1 丈 = 10 尺).

# Equations based on the problem:
# 1. a = b + 2
# 2. a = c + 3
# 3. a = d + 4
# 4. a = e + 5
# 5. a = f/10 + 6  (f is in 尺, so divide by 10 to convert to 丈)

# Solve for 'a' (井深):
a = Fraction(2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + Fraction(6, 10), 5)

# Solve for the rope lengths:
b = a - 2
c = a - 3
d = a - 4
e = a - 5
f = (a - 6) * 10  # Convert back to 尺

# Results:
a  # Depth of the well in 丈
b  # Length of rope for 甲 in 丈
c  # Length of rope for 乙 in 丈
d  # Length of rope for 丙 in 丈
e  # Length of rope for 丁 in 丈
f  # Length of rope for 戊 in 尺


"""


### Explanation:
1. The depth of the well (`a`) is the same for all five families, and each family has a rope that is shorter than the depth of the well by a specific amount.
2. Using the relationships given in the problem, we set up equations for each rope length in terms of `a`.
3. The average of these equations gives the depth of the well (`a`).
4. Using the value of `a`, we calculate the lengths of the ropes for each family (`b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`).

### Output:
The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` will contain the respective values for the depth of the well and the lengths of the ropes.
