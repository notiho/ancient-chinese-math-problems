今有縑一丈價直一百二十八。今有縑一匹九尺五寸，問︰得錢幾何？
術曰：以一丈寸數為法，以價錢數乘今有縑寸數為實，實如法得錢數。
荅曰： a錢 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of a piece of silk that is 9 feet 5 inches long, given that 1丈 (10 feet) of silk costs 128錢. Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
length_of_one_丈_in_feet = 10  # 1丈 = 10 feet
price_of_one_丈 = 128  # 128錢
length_of_silk_in_feet = 9  # 9 feet
length_of_silk_in_inches = 5  # 5 inches

# Convert the length of the silk to inches (1 foot = 12 inches)
length_of_one_丈_in_inches = length_of_one_丈_in_feet * 12
length_of_silk_in_inches_total = (length_of_silk_in_feet * 12) + length_of_silk_in_inches

# Calculate the price of the silk
a = Fraction(price_of_one_丈 * length_of_silk_in_inches_total, length_of_one_丈_in_inches)

# The result is stored in the variable "a"
a


"""


The variable `a` will contain the price of the silk in 錢 as a fraction.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 3168/5, Actual: 1808/15"""
