今有七百三十八户，共請絲二十七斤五两。問：户得㡬何？
術曰：列絲二十七斤，以十六两乘之、納五两，得四百三十七两；又以二十四銖乘之，得一萬四百八十八銖；以七百三十八户除之即得。
答曰： a銖 b 絫 c黍 奇 d銖 e黍 。

To solve this problem, we will calculate how much silk each household gets. The total silk is given as 27 pounds and 5 ounces, and there are 738 households. The units of measurement are as follows:

1 pound = 16 ounces  
1 ounce = 24 zhu (銖)  
1 zhu = 10 shu (黍)

We will convert the total silk into zhu (銖), divide it by the number of households, and then convert the result back into the appropriate units.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total silk in pounds and ounces
total_pounds = 27
total_ounces = 5

# Convert total silk to zhu (銖)
total_zhu = (total_pounds * 16 + total_ounces) * 24

# Number of households
households = 738

# Silk per household in zhu
silk_per_household_zhu = Fraction(total_zhu, households)

# Convert zhu to zhu, shu, and remaining fractions
a = silk_per_household_zhu.numerator // silk_per_household_zhu.denominator  # Whole zhu
remaining_fraction = silk_per_household_zhu - a
b = remaining_fraction.numerator // remaining_fraction.denominator  # Whole shu
remaining_fraction = remaining_fraction - b
c = remaining_fraction.numerator  # Remaining numerator (shu fraction)

# Output the results
print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}")


"""


This code calculates the amount of silk each household receives in the units of zhu (銖), shu (黍), and fractional parts.
