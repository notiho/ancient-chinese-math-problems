"""
今有菽一斗，欲為熟菽。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以菽求熟菽，二十三之，十而一。
荅曰：為熟菽 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem states that if you have 1 "斗" of raw beans ("菽"), you can process it into "熟菽" (cooked beans). The conversion rate is given as "23之，十而一," which means for every 23 units of raw beans, you get 10 units of cooked beans.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
raw_beans = 1  # 1 斗 of raw beans

# Conversion rate: 23 raw beans -> 10 cooked beans
conversion_rate = Fraction(10, 23)

# Calculate the amount of cooked beans
a = raw_beans * conversion_rate

# Output the result
a  # a斗 of cooked beans


"""


The variable `a` will store the amount of cooked beans in "斗."
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 23/10, Actual: 10/23"""
