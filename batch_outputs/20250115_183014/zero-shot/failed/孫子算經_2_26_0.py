今有人盜庫絹，不知所失幾何？但聞草中分絹，人得六匹，盈六匹；人得七匹，不足七匹。問人、絹各幾何？
術曰：先置人得六匹于右上，盈六匹于右下，後置人得七匹于左上，不足七匹于左下，維乘之所得，并之為絹，并盈不足為人。
答曰：賊 a人 ，絹 b匹 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the number of people (`a`) and the total amount of silk (`b`) based on the given conditions. Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given conditions:
# Each person gets 6 pieces of silk, and there are 6 pieces left over.
# Each person gets 7 pieces of silk, and there are 7 pieces short.

# Let a = number of people
# Let b = total pieces of silk

# Using the method described:
# b = (6 * 7) + (6 + 7) = 42 + 13 = 55
# a = (6 + 7) = 13

a = 13  # Number of people
b = 55  # Total pieces of silk


"""


Thus, the solution is:
- `a = 13` (number of people)
- `b = 55` (total pieces of silk)
"""


"""
Variable 'b' has wrong value. Expected: 84, Actual: 55"""
