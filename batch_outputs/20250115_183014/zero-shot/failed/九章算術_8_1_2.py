今有上禾七秉，損實一斗，益之下禾二秉，而實一十斗。下禾八秉，益實一斗與上禾二秉，而實一十斗。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程。損之曰益，益之曰損。損實一斗者，其實過一十斗也。益實一斗者，其實不滿一十斗也。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：上禾 a秉 實 b斗 ，下禾 c秉 實 d斗 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical problem into Python code. The problem involves determining the values of the unknowns `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given equations:
# 1. 7a - 1 = 10
# 2. 8c + 1 = 10
# 3. 2c + 2a = 10

# Solve for a, b, c, and d:
# From equation 1:
b = Fraction(10 + 1, 7)  # b is the value of one秉 of 上禾

# From equation 2:
d = Fraction(10 - 1, 8)  # d is the value of one秉 of 下禾

# From equation 3:
a = Fraction(10 - 2 * d, 2)  # a is the number of 秉 for 上禾
c = Fraction(10 - 2 * a, 2)  # c is the number of 秉 for 下禾

# Results:
a = a
b = b
c = c
d = d


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. The problem provides three equations:
   - Equation 1: \( 7a - 1 = 10 \), which relates the number of 秉 for 上禾 and its 实.
   - Equation 2: \( 8c + 1 = 10 \), which relates the number of 秉 for 下禾 and its 实.
   - Equation 3: \( 2c + 2a = 10 \), which relates the 秉 of 上禾 and 下禾.

2. Using these equations, we solve for the unknowns \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \).

3. The `Fraction` class is used to ensure that the results are expressed as fractions if they are not integers.

### Output:
After running the code, the values of \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \) will be stored in the respective variables.
