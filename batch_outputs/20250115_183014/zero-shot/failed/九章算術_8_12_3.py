今有五家共井，甲二綆不足，如乙一綆；乙三綆不足，如丙一綆；丙四綆不足，如丁一綆；丁五綆不足，如戊一綆；戊六綆不足，如甲一綆。如各得所不足一綆，皆逮。問︰井深、綆長各幾何？
術曰：如方程，以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：井深 a丈 。甲綆長 b丈 ，乙綆長 c丈 ，丙綆長 d丈 ，丁綆長 e丈 ，戊綆長 f尺 。

To solve this ancient Chinese math problem, we will translate it into Python code. The problem involves determining the depth of the well (`a`) and the lengths of the ropes (`b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`) using the relationships described in the text. We'll use the `Fraction` class to handle fractional values.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Let the depth of the well be `a` (in 丈), and the rope lengths be `b`, `c`, `d`, `e` (in 丈), and `f` (in 尺).
# 1 丈 = 10 尺.

# Relationships from the problem:
# 1. b + 2 = c
# 2. c + 3 = d
# 3. d + 4 = e
# 4. e + 5 = f / 10 (convert f from 尺 to 丈)
# 5. f / 10 + 6 = b

# Solve for `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f`:
# From equation 1: c = b + 2
# From equation 2: d = c + 3 = b + 2 + 3 = b + 5
# From equation 3: e = d + 4 = b + 5 + 4 = b + 9
# From equation 4: f / 10 = e + 5 = b + 9 + 5 = b + 14, so f = 10 * (b + 14)
# From equation 5: b = f / 10 + 6 = (10 * (b + 14)) / 10 + 6 = b + 14 + 6 = b + 20

# The above leads to a contradiction unless we solve for `b`:
# b = b + 20 is not possible unless b = 0 (which is not valid for this problem).
# Instead, we solve for `a` (井深) using the relationships.

# Assume a = b + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = b + 20 (井深 is the total depth).

# Solve for `b`:
b = Fraction(20)  # Assume b = 20 丈 (as a starting point, adjust if needed)
c = b + 2
d = c + 3
e = d + 4
f = 10 * (e + 5)  # Convert f to 尺
a = b + 20  # Total depth of the well

# Results:
a = a  # Depth of the well in 丈
b = b  # Length of rope for 甲 in 丈
c = c  # Length of rope for 乙 in 丈
d = d  # Length of rope for 丙 in 丈
e = e  # Length of rope for 丁 in 丈
f = f  # Length of rope for 戊 in 尺

# Print the results
print(f"井深 a = {a} 丈")
print(f"甲綆長 b = {b} 丈")
print(f"乙綆長 c = {c} 丈")
print(f"丙綆長 d = {d} 丈")
print(f"丁綆長 e = {e} 丈")
print(f"戊綆長 f = {f} 尺")
