"""
今有菽二斗，欲為豉。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以菽求豉，七之，五而一。
荅曰：為豉 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many "斗" of "豉" can be obtained from 2 "斗" of "菽". The method provided states: "以菽求豉，七之，五而一," which means for every 7 parts of "菽," 5 parts of "豉" are obtained.

Here is the Python code to compute the value of "a":


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
菽 = 2  # in 斗

# Conversion ratio
豉_per_菽 = Fraction(5, 7)

# Calculate the amount of 豉
a = 菽 * 豉_per_菽

# Output the result
a  # in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will hold the result, which is the amount of "豉" in "斗".
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 14/5, Actual: 10/7"""
