To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. Here's the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
price_expensive_silk = 56  # in wen per liang
price_cheap_silk = 42  # in wen per liang
total_money = 131 * 1000 + 810  # in wen (convert 131 guan to wen and add 810 wen)

# Step 1: Combine the prices of expensive and cheap silk
combined_price = price_expensive_silk + price_cheap_silk  # in wen per liang

# Step 2: Divide the total money by the combined price to get the total silk in liang
total_silk_liang = Fraction(total_money, combined_price)

# Step 3: Convert liang to jin (1 jin = 16 liang)
total_silk_jin = total_silk_liang // 16  # integer division to get whole jin
remaining_liang = total_silk_liang % 16  # remainder in liang

# Step 4: Assign the results to variables
a = total_silk_jin  # in jin
b = remaining_liang  # in liang

# Results
a, b


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Price of expensive and cheap silk**: The prices are given as 56 wen and 42 wen per liang, respectively.
2. **Total money**: The total money is given as 131 guan and 810 wen. Since 1 guan = 1000 wen, we convert this to wen.
3. **Combined price**: The sum of the prices of expensive and cheap silk is calculated.
4. **Total silk in liang**: The total money is divided by the combined price to determine how many liang of silk can be bought.
5. **Convert liang to jin**: Since 1 jin = 16 liang, we calculate the number of whole jin and the remaining liang.
6. **Assign results**: The results are stored in variables `a` (jin) and `b` (liang).

### Output:
The variables `a` and `b` will contain the solution:
- `a`: The number of jin of silk.
- `b`: The remaining liang of silk.
