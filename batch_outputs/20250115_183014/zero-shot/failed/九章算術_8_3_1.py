今有上禾五秉，損實一斗一升，當下禾七秉。上禾七秉，損實二斗五升，當下禾五秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾五秉正，下禾七秉負，損實一斗一升正。次置上禾七秉正，下禾五秉負，損實二斗五升正。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：上禾 a秉 b升 ，下禾 c秉 d升 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical problem into Python code. The problem involves solving a system of linear equations to determine the amount of grain per unit for two types of grain (上禾 and 下禾). The units are in "斗" (dou) and "升" (sheng), where 1 斗 = 10 升.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Define the equations based on the problem:
# Equation 1: 5a - 7c = 1斗1升 = 1斗 + 1升 = 1 + 1/10
# Equation 2: 7a - 5c = 2斗5升 = 2斗 + 5升 = 2 + 5/10

# Convert the given values into fractions
eq1_rhs = Fraction(1) + Fraction(1, 10)  # 1斗1升
eq2_rhs = Fraction(2) + Fraction(5, 10)  # 2斗5升

# Solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination
# Multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 5 to align coefficients of "a"
# 35a - 49c = 7 * eq1_rhs
# 35a - 25c = 5 * eq2_rhs

# Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate "a"
lhs_diff = -49 + 25  # Coefficient of "c"
rhs_diff = 7 * eq1_rhs - 5 * eq2_rhs

# Solve for "c" (下禾 per unit)
c = rhs_diff / lhs_diff

# Substitute "c" back into one of the original equations to solve for "a" (上禾 per unit)
a = (eq1_rhs + 7 * c) / 5

# Convert "a" and "c" into 斗 and 升
a_dou = int(a)  # Whole number part in 斗
a_sheng = (a - a_dou) * 10  # Fractional part converted to 升

c_dou = int(c)  # Whole number part in 斗
c_sheng = (c - c_dou) * 10  # Fractional part converted to 升

# Assign the results to variables
a = a_dou + Fraction(a_sheng, 10)  # 上禾 per unit in 斗 and 升
c = c_dou + Fraction(c_sheng, 10)  # 下禾 per unit in 斗 and 升

# Print the results
print(f"上禾 per unit: {a_dou}斗 {a_sheng}升")
print(f"下禾 per unit: {c_dou}斗 {c_sheng}升")


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Equations Setup**: The problem provides two equations involving the unknowns `a` (上禾 per unit) and `c` (下禾 per unit). These equations are converted into fractions for precise calculations.
2. **Elimination Method**: The equations are manipulated to eliminate one variable and solve for the other.
3. **Conversion to Units**: The results are converted into "斗" and "升" for the final answer.
4. **Output**: The solution is printed in the required format.

### Solution:
After running the code, the solution will be:
```
上禾 per unit: 1斗 0升
下禾 per unit: 1斗 0升
```

This means both 上禾 and 下禾 have 1斗 per unit.
