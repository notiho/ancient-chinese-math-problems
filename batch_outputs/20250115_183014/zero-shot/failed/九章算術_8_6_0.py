今有牛五、羊二，直金十兩。牛二、羊五直金八兩。問︰牛羊各直金幾何？
術曰：如方程。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。荅曰：牛 a ，直金 b兩 ，羊 c ，直金 d兩 。

To solve the problem, we need to translate the ancient Chinese math problem into a system of linear equations. The problem states:

1. 5 cows and 2 sheep cost 10 taels of gold.
2. 2 cows and 5 sheep cost 8 taels of gold.

Let the price of a cow be \( a \) taels of gold and the price of a sheep be \( b \) taels of gold. We can represent the problem as:

\[
5a + 2b = 10
\]
\[
2a + 5b = 8
\]

We will solve this system of equations using Python and the `Fraction` class to ensure precise calculations.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Define the equations
# 5a + 2b = 10
# 2a + 5b = 8

# Coefficients of the equations
A1, B1, C1 = 5, 2, 10
A2, B2, C2 = 2, 5, 8

# Solve for a (price of a cow) and b (price of a sheep) using elimination
# Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 5 to align coefficients of a
# 10a + 4b = 20
# 10a + 25b = 40

# Subtract the first equation from the second
# (10a + 25b) - (10a + 4b) = 40 - 20
# 21b = 20
b = Fraction(20, 21)  # Price of a sheep

# Substitute b back into the first equation to solve for a
# 5a + 2b = 10
# 5a + 2 * (20/21) = 10
# 5a + 40/21 = 10
# 5a = 10 - 40/21
# 5a = 210/21 - 40/21
# 5a = 170/21
a = Fraction(170, 105)  # Simplify to Fraction(34, 21) for the price of a cow

# Assign the results to variables
牛 = "a"
羊 = "b"
