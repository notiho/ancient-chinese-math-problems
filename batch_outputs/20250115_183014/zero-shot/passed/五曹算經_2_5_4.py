今有兵一千三百六十二人，人給絹二丈八尺五寸。問：計㡬何？
術曰：列兵一千三百六十二人，以絹二十八尺五寸乘之，得三萬八千八百一十七尺，以四十尺除之即得。
答曰： a疋 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many bolts of silk ("疋") are required for 1,362 soldiers, where each soldier is given 2丈8尺5寸 of silk. 

### Conversion:
1 丈 = 10 尺  
1 尺 = 10 寸  

So, 2丈8尺5寸 = \( 2 \times 10 + 8 + \frac{5}{10} = 28.5 \) 尺.

### Calculation:
The total amount of silk required is \( 1,362 \times 28.5 \) 尺.  
Since 1 bolt of silk ("疋") is 40 尺, we divide the total silk by 40 to find the number of bolts.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
soldiers = 1362
silk_per_soldier = Fraction(28, 1) + Fraction(5, 10)  # 28.5 尺
silk_per_bolt = 40  # 40 尺 per bolt

# Total silk required
total_silk = soldiers * silk_per_soldier

# Number of bolts required
a = total_silk / silk_per_bolt

# Result
a  # This will store the number of bolts required


"""


The variable `a` will contain the number of bolts of silk required.
