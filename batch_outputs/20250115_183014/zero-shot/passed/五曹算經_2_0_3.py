今有丁二萬三千六百九十二人，責兵五千九百二十三人。問：㡬何丁出一兵？
術曰：列二萬三千六百九十二人，以五千九百二十三除之即得。
答曰： a 丁出 b 兵。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many 丁 (people) are required to produce one 兵 (soldier). Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total number of 丁 (people)
total_people = 23692

# Total number of 兵 (soldiers)
total_soldiers = 5923

# Calculate how many 丁 are required for one 兵
a = Fraction(total_people, total_soldiers)

# Assign the result to b as well (since the problem states "a 丁出 b 兵")
b = 1  # This means 1 兵 is produced

# Results
a, b


"""


Here:
- `a` represents the number of 丁 required to produce one 兵.
- `b` is fixed as 1 because we are calculating for one 兵.

The result will be stored in `a` as a fraction.
