今有委粟平地，下周一十二丈，高二丈。問︰積及為粟幾何？
委粟術曰：下周自乘，以高乘之，三十六而一。其依垣者，十八而一。其依垣內角者，九而一。程粟一斛，積二尺七寸。其米一斛，積一尺六寸、五分寸之一。其菽、答、麻、麥一斛，皆二尺四寸、十分寸之三。
荅曰：積 a尺 。為粟 b斛 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the volume of a conical pile of grain and determining how many units of grain it contains.

The formula for the volume of a conical pile of grain is given as:
- \( V = \frac{\text{(base circumference)}^2 \times \text{height}}{36} \)

The problem also provides the conversion factor for grain:
- 1 "斛" of grain occupies a volume of \( 2 \text{尺} 7 \text{寸} = 2.7 \text{尺} \).

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
base_circumference = 12  # in 丈
height = 2  # in 丈

# Convert 丈 to 尺 (1 丈 = 10 尺)
base_circumference *= 10  # in 尺
height *= 10  # in 尺

# Calculate the volume of the conical pile
a = Fraction(base_circumference**2 * height, 36)  # in cubic 尺

# Conversion factor: 1 斛 = 2.7 尺
grain_volume_per_hu = Fraction(27, 10)  # in 尺

# Calculate the amount of grain in 斛
b = a / grain_volume_per_hu

# Results
a  # Volume in cubic 尺
b  # Amount of grain in 斛


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. The base circumference and height are converted from 丈 to 尺 because the formula uses 尺 as the unit.
2. The volume of the conical pile is calculated using the formula provided in the problem.
3. The volume is then divided by the volume of 1 斛 of grain to determine the total amount of grain in 斛.

### Final Answer:
- \( a \): The volume of the conical pile in cubic 尺.
- \( b \): The amount of grain in 斛.
