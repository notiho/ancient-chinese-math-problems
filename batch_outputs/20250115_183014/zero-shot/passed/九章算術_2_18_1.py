術曰：以粟求櫱，七之，二而一。
荅曰：為櫱 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to compute the value of "a" based on the given instructions. The problem states that to convert 粟 (grain) into 櫱 (seedlings), we multiply the amount of 粟 by 7, then divide by 2.

Here is the Python code to compute the value of "a":


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
grain = 2  # 粟 in 斗

# Calculation
a = Fraction(grain * 7, 2)  # 櫱 in 斗

# Result
a  # This is the value of 櫱 in 斗


"""


The value of `a` represents the amount of 櫱 (seedlings) in 斗.
