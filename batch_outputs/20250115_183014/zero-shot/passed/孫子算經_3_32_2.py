今有出門望見九堤，堤有九木，木有九枝，枝有九巢，巢有九禽，禽有九雛，雛有九毛，毛有九色。問：各幾何？
術曰：置九堤以九乘之，得木之數；又以九乘之，得枝之數；又以九乘之，得巢之數；又以九乘之，得禽之數；又以九乘之，得雛之數；又以九乘之，得毛之數；又以九乘之，得色之數。
答曰：木 a枝 ， b 巢， c 禽， d 雛， e 毛， f 色， g 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves a sequence of multiplications by 9, starting with 9堤 (9 dikes). Each subsequent quantity is obtained by multiplying the previous quantity by 9.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Initial value
堤 = 9

# Calculations
a = 堤 * 9  # 木 (trees)
b = a * 9   # 枝 (branches)
c = b * 9   # 巢 (nests)
d = c * 9   # 禽 (birds)
e = d * 9   # 雛 (chicks)
f = e * 9   # 毛 (feathers)
g = f * 9   # 色 (colors)

# Results
a, b, c, d, e, f, g


"""


The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, and `g` represent the number of trees, branches, nests, birds, chicks, feathers, and colors, respectively. The calculations are straightforward multiplications by 9, as described in the problem.
