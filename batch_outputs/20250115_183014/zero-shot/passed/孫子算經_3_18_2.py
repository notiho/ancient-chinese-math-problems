今有黃金一觔直錢一十萬。問：兩直幾何？
術曰：置錢一十萬，以一十六兩除之，即得。
答曰： a錢 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of "a" in the answer. The problem states that 1 "觔" (jin) of gold is worth 100,000 "錢" (qian), and we are asked how much 1 "兩" (liang) is worth. Since 1 "觔" equals 16 "兩," we divide 100,000 by 16.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_qian = 100000  # 1 觔 is worth 100,000 錢
liang_in_jin = 16    # 1 觔 equals 16 兩

# Calculate the value of 1 兩 in 錢
a = Fraction(total_qian, liang_in_jin)

# Result
a  # This represents the value of 1 兩 in 錢


"""


The variable `a` will contain the value of 1 "兩" in "錢" as a fraction.
