今有丁二萬三千六百九十二人，責兵五千九百二十三人。問：㡬何丁出一兵？
術曰：列二萬三千六百九十二人，以五千九百二十三除之即得。
答曰： a 丁出 b 兵。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 丁 (people) are required to produce 1 兵 (soldier). This is done by dividing the total number of 丁 by the total number of 兵.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total number of 丁
total_ding = 23692

# Total number of 兵
total_bing = 5923

# Calculate how many 丁 are required to produce 1 兵
a = Fraction(total_ding, total_bing)

# 丁 required to produce 1 兵
b = 1

# Results
a, b


"""


This will compute the value of `a` as a fraction, representing how many 丁 are required to produce 1 兵.
