今有粟三斗六升，欲為粺飯。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求粺飯，二十七之，二十五而一。
荅曰：為粺飯 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem states that we have 3斗6升 of 粟 (grain) and we want to calculate how much 粺飯 (refined rice) we can get. The rule provided is to multiply the amount of 粟 by 27 and then divide by 25.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
grain = Fraction(3, 1) + Fraction(6, 10)  # 3斗6升 = 3 + 6/10斗

# Calculation
a = grain * Fraction(27, 25)  # Multiply by 27 and divide by 25

# Result
a  # a斗 of 粺飯


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of refined rice (粺飯) in terms of 斗.
