今有田廣七分步之四，從五分步之三。問：為田幾何？
乘分術曰：母相乘為法，子相乘為實，實如法而一。
荅曰： a步 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the field given as "七分步之四" (4/7 of a step) and "五分步之三" (3/5 of a step). The area is calculated by multiplying these two fractions.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given dimensions of the field
length = Fraction(4, 7)  # 七分步之四
width = Fraction(3, 5)   # 五分步之三

# Calculate the area
a = length * width  # Area in square steps

# The result is stored in variable 'a'


"""


The value of `a` will represent the area of the field in square steps.
