今有粟七斗九升，欲為御米。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求御米，二十一之，五十而一。
荅曰：為御米 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem states that there are 7斗9升 of 粟 (grain), and we want to convert it into 御米 (refined rice). The conversion rule is: multiply the amount of 粟 by 21 and then divide by 50.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# 粟 amount in 斗 and 升
粟_斗 = 7
粟_升 = 9

# Convert 粟 to a single unit (斗), assuming 1斗 = 10升
粟_total_斗 = 粟_斗 + Fraction(粟_升, 10)

# Conversion rule: multiply by 21 and divide by 50
a = 粟_total_斗 * Fraction(21, 50)

# Result
a  # The amount of 御米 in 斗


"""


The variable `a` will contain the result in terms of 御米 (斗).
