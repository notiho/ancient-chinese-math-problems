"""
To solve this problem, we calculate the total area occupied by 23,900 carriages, where each carriage occupies 3 steps of land. The answer will be stored in the variable `a`.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
carriages = 23900  # Number of carriages
steps_per_carriage = 3  # Steps occupied by each carriage

# Calculation
a = carriages * steps_per_carriage

# Result
a  # Total steps


"""


The variable `a` will contain the total number of steps (`a = 71700 steps`).
