今有戶高多於廣六尺八寸，兩隅相去適一丈。問︰戶高、廣各幾何？
術曰：令一丈自乘為實。半相多，令自乘，倍之，減實，半其餘。以開方除之，所得，減相多之半，即戶廣。加相多之半，即戶高。
荅曰：廣 a尺 ；高 b尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the height ("高") and width ("廣") of a door, given that the height exceeds the width by 6尺8寸 (6.8尺), and the diagonal distance between the two corners is 1丈 (10尺). Here's the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
diagonal = Fraction(10)  # 1丈 = 10尺
difference = Fraction(6, 1) + Fraction(8, 10)  # 6尺8寸 = 6.8尺

# Step 1: Let the diagonal squared be the "實" (diagonal^2)
diagonal_squared = diagonal * diagonal

# Step 2: Half the difference (相多之半)
half_difference = difference / 2

# Step 3: Square the half difference and double it
half_difference_squared_doubled = 2 * (half_difference * half_difference)

# Step 4: Subtract the above result from diagonal_squared
remaining = diagonal_squared - half_difference_squared_doubled

# Step 5: Take half of the remaining value
half_remaining = remaining / 2

# Step 6: Compute the square root of half_remaining (開方)
# Since we are not using external functions, we will solve for the square root manually
# by finding the fraction whose square is closest to half_remaining.
# This is a numerical approximation process.

def approximate_square_root(value):
    # Start with an initial guess
    guess = Fraction(1)
    while guess * guess < value:
        guess += Fraction(1, 1000)  # Increment by a small fraction
    return guess

width = approximate_square_root(half_remaining)

# Step 7: Subtract half_difference from the square root to get the width (戶廣)
a = width - half_difference

# Step 8: Add half_difference to the square root to get the height (戶高)
b = width + half_difference

# Results
print(f"廣 a = {a} 尺")
print(f"高 b = {b} 尺")


"""


This code calculates the width (`a`) and height (`b`) of the door in units of 尺. The `approximate_square_root` function is used to compute the square root manually as required.
