今有生絲三十斤，乾之，耗三斤十二兩。今有乾絲一十二斤，問︰生絲幾何？
術曰：置生絲兩數，除耗數，餘，以為法。三十斤乘乾絲兩數為實。實如法得生絲數。
荅曰： a斤 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of raw silk ("生絲") required to produce 12 jin ("斤") of dried silk ("乾絲"), given that drying 30 jin of raw silk results in a loss of 3 jin and 12 liang ("兩"). Note that 16 liang equals 1 jin.

Here is the Python code to compute the value of "a":


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
raw_silk_weight = 30  # in jin
loss_weight_jin = 3  # in jin
loss_weight_liang = 12  # in liang
dried_silk_weight = 12  # in jin

# Convert loss to jin (1 jin = 16 liang)
total_loss = loss_weight_jin + Fraction(loss_weight_liang, 16)

# Calculate the ratio of dried silk to raw silk
dried_to_raw_ratio = (raw_silk_weight - total_loss) / raw_silk_weight

# Calculate the required raw silk weight for 12 jin of dried silk
a = Fraction(dried_silk_weight) / dried_to_raw_ratio

# The result is stored in variable 'a'
a  # in jin


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of raw silk needed in jin.
