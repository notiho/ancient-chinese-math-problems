今有出錢一萬三千六百七十，買絲一石二鈞一十七斤。欲石率之，問︰石幾何？
經術術曰：以所求率乘錢數為實，以所買率為法，實如法得一。
荅曰：一石， a錢
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost per "石" (a unit of weight). The total cost is given as 13,670 (錢), and the total weight is 1 石, 2 鈞, and 17 斤. First, we need to convert the weight into a single unit (斤). 

1 石 = 4 鈞  
1 鈞 = 30 斤  

Thus:  
1 石, 2 鈞, 17 斤 = \( 1 \times 4 \times 30 + 2 \times 30 + 17 \) 斤.

The cost per 石 is calculated by dividing the total cost by the weight in 石.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Total cost in 錢
total_cost = 13670

# Convert weight to 斤
weight_in_jin = 1 * 4 * 30 + 2 * 30 + 17

# Convert weight to 石
weight_in_shi = Fraction(weight_in_jin, 4 * 30)

# Calculate cost per 石
a = Fraction(total_cost, weight_in_shi)

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'
a


"""


The variable `a` will contain the cost per 石 in 錢.
