今有人持米出三關，外關三而取一，中關五而取一，內關七而取一，餘米五斗。問︰本持米幾何？
術曰：置米五斗。以所稅者三之，五之，七之，為實。以餘不稅者二、四、六相乘為法。實如法得一斗。
荅曰： a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the original amount of rice ("a") based on the taxes taken at three checkpoints and the remaining amount.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Remaining rice after taxes
remaining_rice = Fraction(5)  # 5斗

# Tax rates at the three checkpoints
tax_rate_outer = Fraction(1, 3)  # Outer checkpoint takes 1/3
tax_rate_middle = Fraction(1, 5)  # Middle checkpoint takes 1/5
tax_rate_inner = Fraction(1, 7)  # Inner checkpoint takes 1/7

# Complementary fractions (1 - tax rate)
complement_outer = 1 - tax_rate_outer  # 2/3
complement_middle = 1 - tax_rate_middle  # 4/5
complement_inner = 1 - tax_rate_inner  # 6/7

# Multiply the complementary fractions
complement_product = complement_outer * complement_middle * complement_inner  # (2/3) * (4/5) * (6/7)

# Calculate the original amount of rice
a = remaining_rice / complement_product

# The result
a  # Original amount of rice in 斗

This code calculates the original amount of rice (`a`) in 斗. The solution uses the `Fraction` class to ensure precise calculations with fractions. The answer is stored in the variable `a`.
