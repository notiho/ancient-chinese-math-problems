今有覆月田從三十步徑十步。問：為田㡬何？
術曰：列徑十步半之得五步以從三十步乘之即得。
答曰： a步 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the area of a circular field (覆月田) given its diameter (徑) and circumference (從). The formula provided in the problem suggests that the radius is half the diameter, and the area is calculated by multiplying the radius by the circumference.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
diameter = Fraction(10)  # 徑十步
circumference = Fraction(30)  # 從三十步

# Calculate the radius
radius = diameter / 2  # 半徑

# Calculate the area
a = radius * circumference  # 面積

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'
a  # 答曰：a步


"""


The variable `a` will contain the area of the field in terms of steps (步).
