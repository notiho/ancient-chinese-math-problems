今有粟，三千九百九十九斛九斗六升，凡粟九斗易豆一斛。問：計豆幾何？
術曰：置粟三千九百九十九斛九斗六升為實，以九斗為法。實如法，即得。
答曰： a斛 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many "斛" (units of beans) can be obtained by exchanging the given amount of "粟" (grain). The exchange rate is 9斗 (dou) of grain for 1斛 of beans. 

The total amount of grain is given as 3999斛 9斗 6升. Since 10升 = 1斗 and 10斗 = 1斛, we need to convert everything into a consistent unit (升) for calculation.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Conversion factors
sheng_per_dou = 10  # 10升 = 1斗
dou_per_hu = 10     # 10斗 = 1斛

# Total grain in terms of 斛, 斗, and 升
grain_hu = 3999
grain_dou = 9
grain_sheng = 6

# Convert everything to 升
total_sheng = (grain_hu * dou_per_hu * sheng_per_dou) + (grain_dou * sheng_per_dou) + grain_sheng

# Exchange rate: 9斗 = 1斛 of beans
exchange_rate_dou = 9
exchange_rate_sheng = exchange_rate_dou * sheng_per_dou  # Convert 9斗 to 升

# Calculate the number of beans in 斛
a = Fraction(total_sheng, exchange_rate_sheng)

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'
a


"""


This code calculates the value of `a` (the number of 斛 of beans) using the given exchange rate and the total amount of grain. The result will be a `Fraction` to ensure accuracy.
