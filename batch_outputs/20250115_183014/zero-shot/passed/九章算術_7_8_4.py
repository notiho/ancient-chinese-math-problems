今有米在十斗桶中，不知其數。滿中添粟而舂之，得米七斗。問︰故米幾何？
術曰：以盈不足術求之，假令故米二斗，不足二升。令之三斗，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰： a斗 。

To solve this problem, we will use the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method). The problem involves finding the original amount of rice in a 10-dou bucket. After adding millet and processing it, the resulting rice is 7 dou. Two test cases are given:

1. If the original rice is assumed to be 2 dou, the result is 2 sheng (升) short.
2. If the original rice is assumed to be 3 dou, the result is 2 sheng (升) in excess.

We will translate this into Python code to compute the unknown "a" (the original amount of rice in dou).

### Python Code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data:
# Case 1: Assumed original rice = 2 dou, result is 2 sheng short
x1 = Fraction(2)  # Assumed original rice in dou
shortfall = Fraction(2, 10)  # 2 sheng = 2/10 dou

# Case 2: Assumed original rice = 3 dou, result is 2 sheng excess
x2 = Fraction(3)  # Assumed original rice in dou
excess = Fraction(2, 10)  # 2 sheng = 2/10 dou

# Excess and Deficiency Method:
# Formula: a = (x1 * excess + x2 * shortfall) / (excess + shortfall)
a = (x1 * excess + x2 * shortfall) / (excess + shortfall)

# Output the result
a  # The original amount of rice in dou


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. We represent the assumed values of rice (2 dou and 3 dou) as `x1` and `x2`.
2. The shortfall and excess are converted to dou (1 sheng = 1/10 dou).
3. Using the formula for the Excess and Deficiency Method:
   \[
   a = \frac{x_1 \cdot \text{excess} + x_2 \cdot \text{shortfall}}{\text{excess} + \text{shortfall}}
   \]
   we compute the original amount of rice `a`.

### Solution:
The variable `a` will contain the original amount of rice in dou as a `Fraction`.
