今有圓囷周三丈，高一丈六尺。問：受粟㡬何？
術曰：列周三丈自相乘得九百尺以高一丈六尺乘之得一萬四千四百尺以十二除之得一千二百尺以斛法一尺六寸二分除之即得。
答曰： a斛 奇 b尺 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of a cylinder (圓囷) and then convert it into the number of "斛" and remaining "尺". The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:

\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]

However, in ancient Chinese mathematics, they approximate \(\pi\) as 3, so the formula becomes:

\[
V = 3 r^2 h
\]

The problem provides:
- The circumference (周) of the base is 3 丈.
- The height (高) is 1 丈 6 尺.
- 1 丈 = 10 尺.

From the circumference, we can calculate the radius \(r\) as:

\[
r = \frac{\text{circumference}}{2\pi} \approx \frac{\text{circumference}}{6}
\]

Finally, the volume is converted into "斛" and "尺" using the conversion factor:
1 斛 = 1 尺 6 寸 2 分 = \(1 + \frac{6}{10} + \frac{2}{100} = 1.62\) 尺.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
circumference = 3 * 10  # 3 丈 = 30 尺
height = 1 * 10 + 6  # 1 丈 6 尺 = 16 尺
conversion_factor = Fraction(162, 100)  # 1 尺 6 寸 2 分 = 1.62 尺

# Step 1: Calculate the radius
radius = Fraction(circumference, 6)  # r = circumference / 6

# Step 2: Calculate the volume using V = 3 * r^2 * h
volume = 3 * radius**2 * height

# Step 3: Convert the volume into "斛" and remaining "尺"
a = volume // conversion_factor  # Number of 斛
remaining_volume = volume % conversion_factor  # Remaining volume in 尺
b = remaining_volume  # Remaining 尺

# Results
a = int(a)  # Convert to integer for the number of 斛
b = remaining_volume  # Fractional 尺


"""


The variables `a` and `b` will contain the solution:
- `a` is the number of 斛.
- `b` is the remaining 尺 as a fraction.
