"""
今有棋局，方一十九道。問：用棋幾何？
術曰：置一十九道，自相乘之，即得。
答曰： a 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of intersections on a Go board (棋局) with 19 lines (道) on each side. The total number of intersections is the square of the number of lines.

Here is the Python code:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Number of lines on each side
lines = 19

# Total number of intersections
a = lines * lines


"""


The value of `a` will be `361`, representing the total number of intersections on a 19x19 Go board.
