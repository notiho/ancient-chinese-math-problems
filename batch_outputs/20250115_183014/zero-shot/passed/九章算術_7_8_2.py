今有米在十斗桶中，不知其數。滿中添粟而舂之，得米七斗。問︰故米幾何？
術曰：以盈不足術求之，假令故米二斗，不足二升。令之三斗，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。荅曰： a斗 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical method described (盈不足術, "Excess and Deficiency Method") into Python code. The problem involves determining the original amount of rice in a 10-dou bucket, based on the results of adding millet and processing it.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""


from fractions import Fraction

# Given data:
# Hypothesis 1: Original rice = 2 dou, short by 2 sheng (2 dou - 2 sheng = 1 dou 8 sheng)
# Hypothesis 2: Original rice = 3 dou, excess by 2 sheng (3 dou + 2 sheng = 3 dou 2 sheng)
# Resulting rice after processing = 7 dou

# Convert dou and sheng to a common unit (sheng, where 1 dou = 10 sheng)
shortfall_1 = 2  # 2 sheng shortfall for hypothesis 1
excess_2 = 2     # 2 sheng excess for hypothesis 2
rate_1 = 2 * 10  # 2 dou = 20 sheng
rate_2 = 3 * 10  # 3 dou = 30 sheng

# Apply the Excess and Deficiency Method:
# Difference between rates
rate_difference = rate_2 - rate_1  # 30 - 20 = 10 sheng

# Combine shortfall and excess
combined_difference = shortfall_1 + excess_2  # 2 + 2 = 4 sheng

# Compute the original amount of rice in sheng
original_rice_sheng = Fraction(rate_1 * excess_2 + rate_2 * shortfall_1, combined_difference)

# Convert back to dou (1 dou = 10 sheng)
a = original_rice_sheng / 10  # Convert sheng to dou

# Solution
a  # The original amount of rice in dou


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Hypotheses**: Two hypothetical values for the original rice amount are given:
   - Hypothesis 1: 2 dou, which results in a shortfall of 2 sheng.
   - Hypothesis 2: 3 dou, which results in an excess of 2 sheng.
2. **Excess and Deficiency Method**: This method combines the shortfall and excess to find the true value.
   - The difference between the rates (in sheng) is calculated.
   - The combined shortfall and excess are used to compute the original amount.
3. **Units**: The calculations are done in sheng (1 dou = 10 sheng) and converted back to dou at the end.

### Final Answer:
The variable `a` contains the original amount of rice in dou.
