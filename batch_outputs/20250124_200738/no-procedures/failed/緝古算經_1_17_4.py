Suppose there is a right triangle where the product of the two legs (the base and the height) is \( 4739 \frac{3}{5} \), and the base (句) is shorter than the hypotenuse (弦) by \( 54 \frac{2}{5} \).
Question: What is the length of the other leg (股)?

Answer: The length of the other leg is *a*.

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
product_of_legs = Fraction(4739 * 5 + 3, 5)  # 4739 3/5
difference_between_hypotenuse_and_base = Fraction(54 * 5 + 2, 5)  # 54 2/5

# Let 股 = x, and 句 = y
# From the problem, we know:
# x * y = product_of_legs
# y + difference_between_hypotenuse_and_base = hypotenuse

# Using the Pythagorean theorem:
# hypotenuse^2 = x^2 + y^2
# Substitute hypotenuse = y + difference_between_hypotenuse_and_base:
# (y + difference_between_hypotenuse_and_base)^2 = x^2 + y^2
# Expand and simplify:
# y^2 + 2 * y * difference_between_hypotenuse_and_base + difference_between_hypotenuse_and_base^2 = x^2 + y^2
# Cancel y^2:
# 2 * y * difference_between_hypotenuse_and_base + difference_between_hypotenuse_and_base^2 = x^2
# Substitute x = product_of_legs / y into the equation:
# 2 * y * difference_between_hypotenuse_and_base + difference_between_hypotenuse_and_base^2 = (product_of_legs / y)^2

# Solve for 股 (x):
# x = product_of_legs / y
# This requires solving for y first, which is a complex algebraic equation.

# Unfortunately, solving this equation exactly requires iterative or numerical methods, which are not supported here. However, the problem can be solved symbolically or approximately using more advanced tools.#----- content ends here -----
