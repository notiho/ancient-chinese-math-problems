This is a classic ancient Chinese math problem involving a shared well and the lengths of ropes used by five families. Let's solve it step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. Five families (甲, 乙, 丙, 丁, 戊) share a well.
2. Each family has a rope (綆) of a certain length.
3. The relationships between their ropes are as follows:
   - 甲's rope is 2 *綆* shorter than 乙's rope.
   - 乙's rope is 3 *綆* shorter than 丙's rope.
   - 丙's rope is 4 *綆* shorter than 丁's rope.
   - 丁's rope is 5 *綆* shorter than 戊's rope.
   - 戊's rope is 6 *綆* shorter than 甲's rope.
4. If each family gets the additional rope they are missing, they can all reach the bottom of the well.

We need to find:
- The depth of the well (井深, `a`).
- The lengths of the ropes for each family (甲, 乙, 丙, 丁, 戊).

### Solution in Python:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Let the depth of the well be `a` (in 丈), and the lengths of the ropes be:
# 甲: b, 乙: c, 丙: d, 丁: e, 戊: f (all in 丈).

# Relationships between the ropes:
# b + 2 = c
# c + 3 = d
# d + 4 = e
# e + 5 = f
# f + 6 = b + a

# Express all lengths in terms of `b` (甲's rope length):
c = b + 2  # 乙's rope length
d = c + 3  # 丙's rope length
e = d + 4  # 丁's rope length
f = e + 5  # 戊's rope length

# The well depth is the length of the longest rope plus the missing length:
a = f + 6 - b

# Substitute all relationships into the equation for `a`:
# a = (b + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) - b
# a = 20 (丈)

# Now calculate the lengths of the ropes:
井深 = 20  # a = 20 丈
甲綆長 = b = 20 - 6  # b = 14 丈
乙綆長 = c = b + 2  # c = 16 丈
丙綆長 = d = c + 3  # d = 19 丈
丁綆長 = e = d + 4  # e = 23 丈
戊綆長 = f = e + 5  # f = 28 丈

# Final results:
print(f"井深: {井深} 丈")
print(f"甲綆長: {甲綆長} 丈")
print(f"乙綆長: {乙綆長} 丈")
print(f"丙綆長: {丙綆長} 丈")
print(f"丁綆長: {丁綆長} 丈")
print(f"戊綆長: {戊綆長} 丈")

### Explanation of Results:
- The depth of the well (井深) is **20 丈**.
- The lengths of the ropes are:
  - 甲 (b): **14 丈**
  - 乙 (c): **16 丈**
  - 丙 (d): **19 丈**
  - 丁 (e): **23 丈**
  - 戊 (f): **28 丈**

This satisfies all the conditions of the problem.
