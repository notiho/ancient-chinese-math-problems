Suppose there are 9 pieces of gold and 11 pieces of silver, and their total weight is equal. 
If one piece of gold is exchanged for one piece of silver, the gold becomes lighter by 13 liang.
Question: What is the weight of one piece of gold and one piece of silver?

Answer: One piece of gold weighs *a* jin, and one piece of silver weighs *b* jin.
"""

# Let the weight of one piece of gold be x jin, and one piece of silver be y jin.
# Total weight of gold = 9x
# Total weight of silver = 11y
# Initially, 9x = 11y (total weights are equal)
# After exchanging one piece of gold for one piece of silver:
# New weight of gold = 8x
# New weight of silver = 12y
# The gold becomes lighter by 13 liang = 13/16 jin (since 1 jin = 16 liang)
# Therefore, 9x - 8x = 12y - 11y + 13/16
# This simplifies to x = y + 13/16

from fractions import Fraction

# Solve the equations:
# 1. 9x = 11y
# 2. x = y + 13/16

# Substitute x = y + 13/16 into 9x = 11y
# 9(y + 13/16) = 11y
# 9y + 117/16 = 11y
# 2y = 117/16
# y = 117 / (16 * 2)

y = Fraction(117, 32)  # Weight of one piece of silver in jin
x = y + Fraction(13, 16)  # Weight of one piece of gold in jin

# Final results
a = x  # Weight of one piece of gold
b = y  # Weight of one piece of silver

a, b  # Output the weights of gold and silver#----- content ends here -----
