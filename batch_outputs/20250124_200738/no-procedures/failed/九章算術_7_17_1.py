Suppose there are 9 pieces of gold and 11 pieces of silver, and their total weight is equal. 
If one piece of gold is exchanged for one piece of silver, the gold becomes 13 liang lighter.
Question: how much does one piece of gold and one piece of silver weigh?

Answer: one piece of gold weighs *a* jin, and one piece of silver weighs *b* jin.
"""

# Let the weight of one piece of gold be x jin and one piece of silver be y jin.
# Total weight of gold = 9x
# Total weight of silver = 11y
# Initially, 9x = 11y (total weight is equal)
# After exchanging one piece, the gold becomes 13 liang (13/16 jin) lighter:
# 8x + y = 11y - 13/16

from fractions import Fraction

# Solve the equations:
# 1. 9x = 11y
# 2. 8x + y = 11y - 13/16

# From the first equation, express x in terms of y:
x = Fraction(11, 9) * y

# Substitute x into the second equation:
# 8(11/9 * y) + y = 11y - 13/16
# Simplify:
# (88/9)y + y = 11y - 13/16
# (88/9)y + (9/9)y = 11y - 13/16
# (97/9)y = 11y - 13/16
# Multiply through by 144 (LCM of 9 and 16) to eliminate fractions:
# 144 * (97/9)y = 144 * 11y - 144 * 13/16
# 1552y = 1584y - 117
# 1552y - 1584y = -117
# -32y = -117
# y = 117 / 32

y = Fraction(117, 32)  # Weight of one piece of silver in jin

# Substitute y back into x = (11/9)y:
x = Fraction(11, 9) * y  # Weight of one piece of gold in jin

# Final results:
a = x  # Weight of one piece of gold
b = y  # Weight of one piece of silver

a, b  # Output the results#----- content ends here -----
