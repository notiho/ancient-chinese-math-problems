This problem involves calculating the volume of a granary (倉) while accounting for the space taken up by various obstructions (牽 and 柱). Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The granary has dimensions:
   - Length (從): 1 丈 3 尺 = 13 尺
   - Width (廣): 6 尺
   - Height (高): 1 丈 = 10 尺

2. Inside the granary:
   - Two beams (牽) with square cross-sections of 5 寸 each, spanning the length (13 尺).
   - Three beams (牽) with square cross-sections of 4 寸 each, spanning the width (6 尺).
   - One pillar (柱) with a circular cross-section of 周 (circumference) 3 尺 and height 10 尺.

3. The goal is to calculate the remaining volume of the granary (受粟) in terms of *斛* and *寸*.

# Granary dimensions
length = 13  # 尺
width = 6    # 尺
height = 10  # 尺

# Total volume of the granary
total_volume = length * width * height  # in cubic 尺

# Obstructions
# 1. Two beams spanning the length, each with a square cross-section of 5 寸
beam1_cross_section = Fraction(5, 10) ** 2  # Convert 寸 to 尺 and calculate area
beam1_volume = 2 * beam1_cross_section * length  # Multiply by length and count of beams

# 2. Three beams spanning the width, each with a square cross-section of 4 寸
beam2_cross_section = Fraction(4, 10) ** 2  # Convert 寸 to 尺 and calculate area
beam2_volume = 3 * beam2_cross_section * width  # Multiply by width and count of beams

# 3. One pillar with a circular cross-section (周 = 3 尺, height = 10 尺)
pillar_radius = Fraction(3, 2 * math.pi)  # Calculate radius from circumference (周 = 2πr)
pillar_cross_section = math.pi * pillar_radius ** 2  # Area of the circular cross-section
pillar_volume = pillar_cross_section * height  # Multiply by height

# Total volume of obstructions
obstruction_volume = beam1_volume + beam2_volume + pillar_volume

# Remaining volume for storing grain
remaining_volume = total_volume - obstruction_volume

# Convert remaining volume to 斛 and 寸
# 1 斛 = 10 cubic 尺
a = remaining_volume // 10  # Number of 斛
b = remaining_volume % 10   # Remaining cubic 尺 (寸)

# Output the result
a = Fraction(a)
b = Fraction(b)

### Explanation:
1. **Granary Volume**: The total volume of the granary is calculated as `length * width * height`.
2. **Obstructions**:
   - The beams are rectangular prisms, so their volume is the cross-sectional area multiplied by their length/width.
   - The pillar is a cylinder, so its volume is the cross-sectional area (circle) multiplied by its height.
3. **Remaining Volume**: Subtract the total obstruction volume from the granary's total volume.
4. **Conversion**: Convert the remaining volume into *斛* (1 斛 = 10 cubic 尺) and the remainder in *寸*.

---

### Final Answer:
The remaining volume is `a` 斛 and `b` 寸.
