This is a complex ancient Chinese math problem involving the calculation of dimensions for square and circular granaries. Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given:**
   - Total millet: 26,342 石 4 斗.
   - There are 6 square granaries and 4 circular granaries.
   - The square granaries have a smaller top square and a larger bottom square.
   - The circular granaries have a smaller top circle and a larger bottom circle.
   - The depth of the granaries is the same for both square and circular granaries.
   - The depth is 7 尺 less than the bottom side and 1 丈 4 尺 (14 尺) more than the top side.

2. **Objective:**
   - Find the dimensions of the square granaries:
     - Top side (a 尺),
     - Bottom side (b 丈),
     - Depth (c 丈).
   - The circular granaries will have the same dimensions as the square granaries.

3. **Conversion:**
   - 1 石 = 10 斗.
   - 1 丈 = 10 尺.

4. **Volume Formulas:**
   - Volume of a square granary:
     \[
     V_{\text{square}} = \frac{h}{3} \times (A^2 + AB + B^2)
     \]
     where \( A \) is the top side, \( B \) is the bottom side, and \( h \) is the depth.
   - Volume of a circular granary:
     \[
     V_{\text{circle}} = \frac{h}{3} \times \pi \times (r_1^2 + r_1 r_2 + r_2^2)
     \]
     where \( r_1 \) is the top radius, \( r_2 \) is the bottom radius, and \( h \) is the depth.

5. **Total Volume:**
   - Total volume of 6 square granaries + 4 circular granaries = Total millet.

        if h == A + 14:  # Ensure depth relationship is satisfied
            total_vol = total_volume(A, B)
            if round(total_vol) == total_millet_dou:  # Match total millet
                a = A
                b = Fraction(B, 10)  # Convert to 丈
                c = Fraction(h, 10)  # Convert to 丈

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Conversion:**
   - The total millet is converted into 斗 for easier calculations.

2. **Volume Functions:**
   - The volume of a square granary is calculated using the given formula.
   - The volume of a circular granary is calculated similarly, with \(\pi\) included.

3. **Iterative Search:**
   - The code iterates over possible values of \( A \) (top side) and \( B \) (bottom side).
   - It ensures the relationship between \( A \), \( B \), and \( h \) (depth) is satisfied.
   - It checks if the total volume matches the total millet.

4. **Output:**
   - The dimensions \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are printed when a match is found.

### Note:
This code uses fractions for precise calculations and avoids floating-point errors. The solution assumes the dimensions are integers or simple fractions. Adjust the range of \( A \) and \( B \) as needed for larger or smaller granaries.
