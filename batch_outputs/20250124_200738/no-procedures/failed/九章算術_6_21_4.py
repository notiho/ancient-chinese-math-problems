Suppose one person in one day can make 38 male tiles (牡瓦), and one person in one day can make 76 female tiles (牝瓦).
Now, if one person in one day is tasked to make tiles such that the male and female tiles are equal in number, how many tiles can they produce in total?

Answer: *a* tiles.
"""

# One person makes 38 male tiles in one day
male_tiles = 38

# One person makes 76 female tiles in one day
female_tiles = 76

# To make equal numbers of male and female tiles, calculate the rate of production per tile type
# The rate of making male tiles is 1/38 days per tile
# The rate of making female tiles is 1/76 days per tile
# Combined rate for making one male and one female tile (pair) is:
rate_per_pair = Fraction(1, male_tiles) + Fraction(1, female_tiles)

# Total number of tiles produced in one day (牝 and 牡 combined) is the reciprocal of the rate per pair
a = 1 / rate_per_pair

# Simplify the result
a = a.numerator // a.denominator  # Convert to an integer since we're counting tiles#----- content ends here -----
