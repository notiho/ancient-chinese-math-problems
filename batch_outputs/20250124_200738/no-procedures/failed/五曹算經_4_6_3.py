This problem involves calculating the volume of a granary (倉) while accounting for the space taken up by beams (牽) and a pillar (柱). The goal is to determine how much grain (粟) the granary can hold.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Granary Dimensions**:
   - Length (從): 1 丈 3 尺 = 13 尺
   - Width (廣): 6 尺
   - Height (高): 1 丈 = 10 尺

2. **Beams (牽)**:
   - Two beams (2 枚) with a square cross-section of 5 寸 × 5 寸, each spanning the length of the granary (13 尺).
   - Three beams (3 枚) with a square cross-section of 4 寸 × 4 寸, each spanning the width of the granary (6 尺).

3. **Pillar (柱)**:
   - One pillar (1 枚) with a circular cross-section of diameter 3 尺 and height 10 尺.

4. **Grain Volume**:
   - The volume of the granary is reduced by the volume of the beams and the pillar.
   - 1 斛 = 10 cubic 尺.

### Solution in Python:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction
import math

# Granary dimensions
length = 13  # 尺
width = 6    # 尺
height = 10  # 尺

# Total granary volume
granary_volume = length * width * height  # in cubic 尺

# Beams (牽)
# Two beams, each 5 寸 × 5 寸 × 13 尺
beam1_volume = 2 * (Fraction(5, 10) ** 2) * length  # Convert 寸 to 尺
# Three beams, each 4 寸 × 4 寸 × 6 尺
beam2_volume = 3 * (Fraction(4, 10) ** 2) * width   # Convert 寸 to 尺

# Pillar (柱)
# One pillar with diameter 3 尺 and height 10 尺
pillar_radius = Fraction(3, 2)  # Radius = diameter / 2
pillar_volume = math.pi * (pillar_radius ** 2) * height

# Total obstruction volume (beams + pillar)
obstruction_volume = beam1_volume + beam2_volume + pillar_volume

# Usable volume for grain
usable_volume = granary_volume - obstruction_volume

# Convert usable volume to 斛 and 寸
a = int(usable_volume // 10)  # Whole 斛
b = usable_volume % 10        # Remaining cubic 尺

# Output results
a, b

### Explanation:
1. **Granary Volume**:
   - The total volume of the granary is calculated as `length × width × height`.

2. **Beam Volumes**:
   - The cross-sectional area of each beam is converted from square 寸 to square 尺 by dividing by \(10^2\).
   - The volume is then calculated by multiplying the cross-sectional area by the beam's length.

3. **Pillar Volume**:
   - The pillar's cross-sectional area is circular, so the formula for the area of a circle (\(\pi r^2\)) is used.
   - The volume is calculated by multiplying the area by the pillar's height.

4. **Usable Volume**:
   - The total obstruction volume (beams + pillar) is subtracted from the granary's total volume.
   - The result is converted into 斛 (10 cubic 尺 per 斛) and the remainder in cubic 尺.

---

### Final Answer:
The granary can hold **a 斛 and b 寸** of grain, where `a` and `b` are calculated by the Python code above.
