This problem involves solving a right triangle where the product of the two legs (the "ju" and "gu") is given, and the hypotenuse ("xian") is related to one of the legs. Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.

---

### Problem:
- The product of the two legs (ju and gu) is \( \frac{1}{765} \).
- The hypotenuse (xian) is \( \frac{9}{36} = \frac{1}{4} \) more than one of the legs (ju).
- Find the values of ju (\(a\)), gu (\(b\)), and xian (\(c\)).

---

### Solution in Python:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction
from math import sqrt

# Given values
ju_gu_product = Fraction(1, 765)  # The product of ju and gu
xian_minus_ju = Fraction(9, 36)  # The difference between xian and ju

# Let ju = x, gu = y, and xian = z
# We know:
# 1. x * y = 1/765
# 2. z = x + 1/4
# 3. z^2 = x^2 + y^2 (Pythagorean theorem)

# Step 1: Express y in terms of x using x * y = 1/765
# y = (1/765) / x
