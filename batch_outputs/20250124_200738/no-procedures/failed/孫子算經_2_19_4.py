Suppose there is a square area of 35,000 bu.  
Question: if this area is transformed into a circle, what is the diameter of the circle?

Answer: the diameter is *a* bu.
"""

# Square area in bu
square_area = 35000

# Formula to convert square area to circular diameter:
# Diameter = 2 * sqrt(square_area / π)
# In ancient Chinese mathematics, π was approximated as 3.

pi = 3

# Calculate the diameter
a = Fraction(2 * square_area, pi).sqrt()
