今有上禾五秉，損實一斗一升，當下禾七秉。上禾七秉，損實二斗五升，當下禾五秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
荅曰：上禾一秉 a升 ，下禾一秉 b升 。

Suppose there are two types of grain: "upper grain" (上禾) and "lower grain" (下禾). 

- 5 bundles of upper grain lose 1 dou and 1 sheng of grain, which is equivalent to 7 bundles of lower grain.
- 7 bundles of upper grain lose 2 dou and 5 sheng of grain, which is equivalent to 5 bundles of lower grain.

Question: How much grain does one bundle of upper grain (上禾) and one bundle of lower grain (下禾) yield, respectively?

Answer: One bundle of upper grain yields *a* sheng, and one bundle of lower grain yields *b* sheng.

from fractions import Fraction

# Convert dou and sheng to sheng (1 dou = 10 sheng)
loss_1 = 1 * 10 + 1  # 1 dou 1 sheng = 11 sheng
loss_2 = 2 * 10 + 5  # 2 dou 5 sheng = 25 sheng

# Equations based on the problem:
# 5 * a = 7 * b + 11
# 7 * a = 5 * b + 25

# Solve for a (upper grain per bundle) and b (lower grain per bundle)
# Rearrange the equations:
# a = (7 * b + 11) / 5
# Substitute a into the second equation:
# 7 * ((7 * b + 11) / 5) = 5 * b + 25

# Solve for b:
b = Fraction(7 * 11 - 5 * 25, 35 - 5 * 7)

# Solve for a using the first equation:
a = Fraction(7 * b + 11, 5)

# Results
a, b  # a is the grain yield of one bundle of upper grain, b is the grain yield of one bundle of lower grain.#----- content ends here -----
