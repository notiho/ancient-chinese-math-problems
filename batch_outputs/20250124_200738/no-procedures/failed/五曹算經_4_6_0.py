This is a complex ancient Chinese math problem involving the calculation of the volume of a granary (倉) with specific dimensions and accounting for the space taken up by beams (牽) and a pillar (柱). Let's break it down and solve it step by step in Python.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The granary has dimensions:
   - Length (從): 1 丈 3 尺 = 13 尺
   - Width (廣): 6 尺
   - Height (高): 1 丈 = 10 尺

2. Inside the granary:
   - There are **2 beams (牽)** along the length, each with a square cross-section of 5 寸 × 5 寸.
   - There are **3 beams (牽)** along the width, each with a square cross-section of 4 寸 × 4 寸.
   - There is **1 pillar (柱)** with a circular cross-section of 周 (circumference) 3 尺 and height 10 尺.

3. The task is to calculate the remaining volume of the granary (after accounting for the beams and pillar) and determine how much millet (粟) it can hold. The volume of millet is expressed in **斛** (1 斛 = 1000 cubic 寸).

# Granary dimensions in 尺
length = 13  # 1 丈 3 尺 = 13 尺
width = 6    # 6 尺

# Total volume of the granary in cubic 尺
total_volume = length * width * height

# Beams along the length (2 beams, each 5 寸 × 5 寸)
beam_length_cross_section = Fraction(5, 10) * Fraction(5, 10)  # Convert 寸 to 尺
beam_length_volume = 2 * beam_length_cross_section * length

# Beams along the width (3 beams, each 4 寸 × 4 寸)
beam_width_cross_section = Fraction(4, 10) * Fraction(4, 10)  # Convert 寸 to 尺
beam_width_volume = 3 * beam_width_cross_section * width

pillar_cross_section = math.pi * pillar_radius**2
pillar_volume = pillar_cross_section * height

# Remaining volume in cubic 尺
remaining_volume = total_volume - beam_length_volume - beam_width_volume - pillar_volume

# Convert remaining volume to 斛 and 寸 (1 斛 = 1000 cubic 寸, 1 尺³ = 1000 寸³)

a = remaining_volume_in_cubic_cun // 1000  # Integer part in 斛

# Output the result
a = Fraction(a)
b = Fraction(b)

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Granary Volume**: The total volume of the granary is calculated as `length × width × height` in cubic 尺.
2. **Beam Volumes**:
   - The cross-sectional area of each beam is converted from 寸² to 尺² by dividing by 10².
   - The volume of each beam is then calculated by multiplying the cross-sectional area by its length or width.
3. **Pillar Volume**:
   - The radius of the pillar is derived from its circumference using the formula \( r = \frac{\text{周}}{2\pi} \).
   - The cross-sectional area is calculated as \( \pi r^2 \), and the volume is obtained by multiplying by the height.
4. **Remaining Volume**: The total volume minus the volumes of the beams and pillar gives the remaining volume.
5. **Conversion to 斛 and 寸**: The remaining volume is converted from cubic 尺 to cubic 寸 (1 尺³ = 1000 寸³), and then to 斛 and 寸 (1 斛 = 1000 寸³).

---

### Final Answer:
The output will be in the form:
```
答曰：受粟 a 斛 奇 b 寸。
```

Where `a` is the number of 斛 and `b` is the remaining cubic 寸.
