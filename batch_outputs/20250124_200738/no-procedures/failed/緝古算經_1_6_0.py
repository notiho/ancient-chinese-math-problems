This is a classic ancient Chinese math problem involving a frustum-shaped granary. Let's break it down step by step and solve it.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The granary is a frustum (a truncated pyramid) with a square base.
   - The top side (smaller square) is smaller than the bottom side (larger square) by 6 chi.
   - The height of the granary is 9 chi more than the side length of the top square.

2. The granary can hold 187 **石** and 2 **斗** of grain in total.

3. 50 **石** and 4 **斗** of grain have been removed, and we need to calculate the remaining depth of the grain.

4. We need to find:
   - The side length of the top square (`a` chi),
   - The side length of the bottom square (`b` chi),
   - The height of the granary (`c` zhang),
   - The remaining depth of the grain (`d` chi).

---

### Solution:

We will use the formula for the volume of a frustum of a square pyramid:

\[
V = \frac{h}{3} \times (a^2 + ab + b^2)
\]

Where:
- \(V\) is the volume,
- \(h\) is the height,
- \(a\) is the side length of the top square,
- \(b\) is the side length of the bottom square.

---

### Step 1: Convert the total volume into cubic chi
1 **石** = 10 **斗**, and 1 **斗** = 1 cubic chi.

Thus, the total volume of the granary is:

\[
187 \text{ 石 } + 2 \text{ 斗 } = (187 \times 10) + 2 = 1872 \text{ cubic chi.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Define relationships between dimensions
- Let the side length of the top square be \(a\) chi.
- Then, the side length of the bottom square is \(b = a + 6\) chi.
- The height of the granary is \(c = a + 9\) chi.

---

### Step 3: Solve for \(a\) (top side length)
Substitute \(b = a + 6\) and \(c = a + 9\) into the volume formula:

\[
1872 = \frac{(a + 9)}{3} \times \left(a^2 + a(a + 6) + (a + 6)^2\right)
\]

Simplify the terms inside the parentheses:

\[
a^2 + a(a + 6) + (a + 6)^2 = a^2 + a^2 + 6a + a^2 + 12a + 36 = 3a^2 + 18a + 36
\]

Substitute back into the volume formula:

\[
1872 = \frac{(a + 9)}{3} \times (3a^2 + 18a + 36)
\]

Simplify further:

\[
1872 = (a + 9) \times (a^2 + 6a + 12)
\]

Expand the right-hand side:

\[
1872 = a^3 + 6a^2 + 12a + 9a^2 + 54a + 108
\]

\[
1872 = a^3 + 15a^2 + 66a + 108
\]

Rearrange into standard form:

\[
a^3 + 15a^2 + 66a - 1764 = 0
\]

---

### Step 4: Solve the cubic equation
Using trial and error, we find that \(a = 6\) satisfies the equation:

\[
6^3 + 15(6^2) + 66(6) - 1764 = 0
\]

Thus, the side length of the top square is:

\[
a = 6 \text{ chi.}
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate other dimensions
- The side length of the bottom square is:

\[
b = a + 6 = 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ chi.}
\]

- The height of the granary is:

\[
c = a + 9 = 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ chi.} = 1.5 \text{ zhang.}
\]

---

### Step 6: Calculate the remaining grain depth
After removing 50 **石** and 4 **斗**, the remaining volume is:

\[
50 \text{ 石 } + 4 \text{ 斗 } = (50 \times 10) + 4 = 504 \text{ cubic chi.}
\]

The remaining volume is:

\[
1872 - 504 = 1368 \text{ cubic chi.}
\]

Let the remaining depth of the grain be \(d\). The formula for the volume of a partially filled frustum is:

\[
V = \frac{d}{3} \times (a^2 + ab + b^2)
\]

Substitute \(a = 6\), \(b = 12\), and \(V = 1368\):

\[
1368 = \frac{d}{3} \times (6^2 + 6(12) + 12^2)
\]

Simplify the terms inside the parentheses:

\[
6^2 + 6(12) + 12^2 = 36 + 72 + 144 = 252
\]

Substitute back:

\[
1368 = \frac{d}{3} \times 252
\]

Simplify:

\[
1368 = 84d
\]

Solve for \(d\):

\[
d = \frac{1368}{84} = 16.3 \text{ chi (approximately).}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
- Top side length (\(a\)): **6 chi**,
- Bottom side length (\(b\)): **12 chi**,
- Height (\(c\)): **1.5 zhang**,
- Remaining grain depth (\(d\)): **16.3 chi (approximately)**.#----- content ends here -----
