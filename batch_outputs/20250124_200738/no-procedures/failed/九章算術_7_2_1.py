Suppose a group of people jointly buys a jade (璡). If each person contributes half a unit of money, there is an excess of 4 units. 
If each person contributes half a unit less, there is a shortfall of 3 units. 

Question: How many people are there, and what is the price of the jade?

Answer: There are *a* people, and the price of the jade is *b*.

from fractions import Fraction

# Let the number of people be x and the price of the jade be y

# Equation 2: x * (1/2 - 1/2) = y - 3
