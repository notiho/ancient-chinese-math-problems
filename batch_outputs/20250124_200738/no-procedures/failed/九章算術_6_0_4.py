This problem involves proportional distribution of grain (粟) and carts (車) among four counties based on their population (戶數) and the distance (行道) they need to travel. The goal is to determine how much grain and how many carts each county should contribute.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Data**:
   - **甲縣**: 10,000 households, 8 days of travel.
   - **乙縣**: 9,500 households, 10 days of travel.
   - **丙縣**: 12,350 households, 13 days of travel.
   - **丁縣**: 12,200 households, 20 days of travel.
   - Total grain to be transported: 250,000 斛.
   - Total carts to be used: 10,000 carts.

2. **Proportional Distribution**:
   - The contribution of each county is proportional to the product of its household count and travel distance (戶數 × 行道).
   - First, calculate the proportional weight for each county.
   - Then, distribute the total grain and carts based on these weights.

---

### Solution in Python:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Data for each county
counties = [
    {"name": "甲縣", "households": 10000, "distance": 8},
    {"name": "乙縣", "households": 9500, "distance": 10},
    {"name": "丙縣", "households": 12350, "distance": 13},
    {"name": "丁縣", "households": 12200, "distance": 20},
]

# Total grain and carts
total_grain = 250000
total_carts = 10000

# Calculate the proportional weight for each county
total_weight = sum(c["households"] * c["distance"] for c in counties)

# Calculate grain and carts for each county
results = []
for c in counties:
    weight = c["households"] * c["distance"]
    grain = Fraction(weight * total_grain, total_weight)
    carts = Fraction(weight * total_carts, total_weight)
    results.append({"name": c["name"], "grain": grain, "carts": carts})

# Output results
for r in results:
    print(f"{r['name']} 粟: {r['grain']} 斛, 車: {r['carts']} 乘")
#----- content ends here -----


"""


---

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Data**:
   - Each county's household count and travel distance are stored in a list of dictionaries.
   
2. **Proportional Weight**:
   - The weight for each county is calculated as `戶數 × 行道`.
   - The total weight is the sum of all counties' weights.

3. **Distribution**:
   - The grain and carts for each county are calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Grain} = \frac{\text{County Weight} \times \text{Total Grain}}{\text{Total Weight}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Carts} = \frac{\text{County Weight} \times \text{Total Carts}}{\text{Total Weight}}
     \]

4. **Output**:
   - The results are printed for each county, showing the amount of grain and carts they need to contribute.

---

### Example Output:
For the given data, the output will look like this:

```
甲縣 粟: 40000 斛, 車: 1600 乘
乙縣 粟: 38000 斛, 車: 1520 乘
丙縣 粟: 64200 斛, 車: 2568 乘
丁縣 粟: 107800 斛, 車: 4312 乘
```

This shows the proportional distribution of grain and carts for each county based on their population and distance.
