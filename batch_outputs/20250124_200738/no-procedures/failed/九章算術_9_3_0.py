Suppose there is a cylindrical log with a diameter of 2 chi and 5 cun. It is desired to make it into a square plank with a thickness of 7 cun.
Question: what is the width of the square plank?

Answer: the width is *a* chi.

# 圓材徑二尺五寸 (convert to chi)
直徑 = 2 + Fraction(5, 10)

# 半徑 (radius)
半徑 = 直徑 / 2

# 厚七寸 (convert to chi)
厚 = Fraction(7, 10)

# The width of the square plank is determined by the largest square that can fit within the circle.
# The diagonal of the square equals the diameter of the circle.
# Using the relationship: diagonal = width * sqrt(2), we solve for width.
# width = diameter / sqrt(2)
