This is a classic ancient Chinese mathematics problem involving the calculation of dimensions for a square granary and a circular granary based on given volume and geometric relationships. Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given:**
   - Total volume of grain: `16348石8斗` (convert to cubic chi).
   - There are **4 square granaries** and **3 circular granaries**.
   - The height (or depth) of the granaries is the same for both types.
   - The side length of the square granary is 1 zhang less than the diameter of the circular granary.
   - The side length of the square granary is 5 chi more than the height.
   - Conversion rules:
     - 1 石 = 10 斗.
     - 1 斗 = \( 2.5^3 = 15.625 \) cubic chi (based on the given "斛法二尺五寸").
     - Circular area formula: \( \pi = \frac{22}{7} \), \( \text{Area} = \frac{\pi \cdot d^2}{4} \).

2. **Unknowns:**
   - Side length of the square granary (`a` zhang).
   - Height of the granaries (`b` zhang).
   - Diameter of the circular granary (`c` zhang).

3. **Relationships:**
   - Total volume = Volume of 4 square granaries + Volume of 3 circular granaries.
   - \( a = c - 1 \) (side length of square granary is 1 zhang less than the circular diameter).
   - \( a = b + 0.5 \) (side length of square granary is 5 chi more than the height).

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_volume_stone = 16348 + Fraction(8, 10)  # Convert 16348石8斗 to 石
volume_per_stone = 15.625  # 1石 = 10斗, 1斗 = 15.625 cubic chi
total_volume_chi = total_volume_stone * volume_per_stone  # Total volume in cubic chi

# Conversion factors
zhang_to_chi = 10  # 1丈 = 10尺
pi = Fraction(22, 7)  # Approximation of π

# Let the unknowns be:
# a = side length of square granary (in zhang)
# b = height of granaries (in zhang)
# c = diameter of circular granary (in zhang)

# Relationships:
# a = c - 1
# a = b + 0.5
# Total volume = 4 * (a^2 * b) + 3 * (pi * (c/2)^2 * b)

# Solve step by step
# 1. Express a and b in terms of c
c = Fraction(7, 1)  # Start with an assumption for c (diameter of circular granary in zhang)
a = c - 1  # Side length of square granary
b = a - Fraction(1, 2)  # Height of granary

# 2. Calculate volumes
# Volume of 4 square granaries: 4 * (a^2 * b)
volume_square = 4 * (a**2 * b)

# Volume of 3 circular granaries: 3 * (pi * (c/2)^2 * b)
radius = c / 2  # Radius of circular granary
volume_circle = 3 * (pi * radius**2 * b)

# Total volume
total_volume_calculated = volume_square + volume_circle

# 3. Adjust c until total_volume_calculated matches total_volume_chi
while total_volume_calculated != total_volume_chi:
    c += Fraction(1, 100)  # Increment c in small steps (1 chi)
    a = c - 1
    b = a - Fraction(1, 2)
    volume_square = 4 * (a**2 * b)
    volume_circle = 3 * (pi * radius**2 * b)
    total_volume_calculated = volume_square + volume_circle

# Convert results to zhang
a_zhang = a
b_zhang = b
c_zhang = c

# Output results
print(f"方 (side length of square granary): {a_zhang} 丈")
print(f"高深 (height/depth of granaries): {b_zhang} 丈")
print(f"圓徑 (diameter of circular granary): {c_zhang} 丈")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Conversion of Units:** The total volume is converted from 石 and 斗 to cubic chi using the given conversion factor.
2. **Relationships:** The relationships between `a`, `b`, and `c` are encoded directly into the equations.
3. **Iterative Solution:** Since the problem involves solving a non-linear equation, we iteratively adjust `c` (the diameter of the circular granary) until the calculated total volume matches the given total volume.
4. **Output:** The final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are printed in zhang.

---

### Note:
This code uses an iterative approach to solve the problem. If you want a more precise algebraic solution, you can solve the equations symbolically, but that would require more advanced techniques.
