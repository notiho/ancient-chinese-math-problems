Suppose you go out and see nine dikes. Each dike has nine trees, each tree has nine branches, each branch has nine nests, each nest has nine birds, each bird has nine chicks, each chick has nine feathers, and each feather has nine colors.

Question: How many of each are there?

Answer:
- Trees: *a*
- Branches: *b*
- Nests: *c*
- Birds: *d*
- Chicks: *e*
- Feathers: *f*
- Colors: *g*

b = a * base  # Branches
c = b * base  # Nests
d = c * base  # Birds
e = d * base  # Chicks
f = e * base  # Feathers
g = f * base  # Colors

# Results:
a, b, c, d, e, f, g#----- content ends here -----
