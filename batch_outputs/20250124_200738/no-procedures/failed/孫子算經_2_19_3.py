Suppose there is a square area of 35,000 bu. 
Question: if this area is converted into a circle, what is the diameter of the circle?

Answer: the diameter is *a* bu.

# Square area
square_area = 35000

# Formula for converting square area to a circle's diameter:
# Diameter = 2 * sqrt(square_area / π)
# In ancient Chinese mathematics, π was approximated as 3.

# Using π = 3:
pi = 3

# Diameter of the circle
a = Fraction(2 * square_area, pi).sqrt()#----- content ends here -----
