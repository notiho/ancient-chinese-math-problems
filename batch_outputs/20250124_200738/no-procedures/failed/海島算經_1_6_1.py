今有望清淵，淵下有白石。偃矩岸上，令句高三尺。斜望水岸，入下股四尺五寸。望白石，入下股二尺四寸。又設重矩于上，其間相去四尺。更從句端斜望水岸，入上股四尺。以望白石，入上股二尺二寸。問水深幾何？
答曰： a丈 。

This problem involves using geometry to calculate the depth of water based on observations and measurements. Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. There is a body of water with a white stone at the bottom.
2. A measuring tool (a carpenter's square) is placed on the bank, with its vertical leg (句) 3 chi high.
3. Observations are made:
   - Looking at the water's edge, the diagonal (斜望) enters the lower horizontal leg (股) by 4 chi 5 cun.
   - Looking at the white stone, the diagonal enters the lower horizontal leg by 2 chi 4 cun.
4. A second measuring tool is placed 4 chi away from the first.
5. Observations are made again:
   - Looking at the water's edge, the diagonal enters the upper horizontal leg by 4 chi.
   - Looking at the white stone, the diagonal enters the upper horizontal leg by 2 chi 2 cun.
6. The goal is to calculate the depth of the water (水深).

---

### Assumptions:
- 1 chi = 10 cun (used for unit conversion).
- The problem involves similar triangles and proportions to calculate the depth.

---

### Python Code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Measurements in chi and cun
句高 = Fraction(3, 1)  # Vertical leg height (3 chi)
下股_水岸 = Fraction(4, 1) + Fraction(5, 10)  # Lower horizontal leg to water's edge (4 chi 5 cun)
下股_白石 = Fraction(2, 1) + Fraction(4, 10)  # Lower horizontal leg to white stone (2 chi 4 cun)
上股_水岸 = Fraction(4, 1)  # Upper horizontal leg to water's edge (4 chi)
上股_白石 = Fraction(2, 1) + Fraction(2, 10)  # Upper horizontal leg to white stone (2 chi 2 cun)
兩矩距離 = Fraction(4, 1)  # Distance between the two measuring tools (4 chi)

# Step 1: Calculate the depth of the water using similar triangles
# Using the lower measurements:
水深_下 = (句高 * 下股_白石) / (下股_水岸 - 下股_白石)

# Using the upper measurements:
水深_上 = (句高 * 上股_白石) / (上股_水岸 - 上股_白石)

# Step 2: The two measurements should agree, so we take the average (if needed)
水深 = (水深_下 + 水深_上) / 2

# Convert to zhang (1 zhang = 10 chi)
水深_丈 = 水深 / 10

# Output the result
水深_丈

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Measurements**: All measurements are converted into fractions for precise calculations.
2. **Similar Triangles**: The depth of the water is calculated using the property of similar triangles:
   \[
   \text{Water Depth} = \frac{\text{Vertical Height (句高)} \times \text{Horizontal Distance to White Stone (入股)}}{\text{Difference in Horizontal Distances (水岸 - 白石)}}
   \]
3. **Two Observations**: The depth is calculated twice (once for each measuring tool) and averaged if necessary.
4. **Unit Conversion**: The final depth is converted from chi to zhang.

---

### Final Answer:
The depth of the water (水深) is `a` zhang, where `a` is the result of the calculation.
