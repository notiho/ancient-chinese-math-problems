This problem involves ancient Chinese astronomy and calendar calculations. It is asking for the position of the moon at midnight on the first day of the 11th month, based on the given parameters. Let's break it down step by step and solve it.

---

### Known values:
1. **Sun's position at midnight**: 斗 (Dipper) 10 degrees + \( \frac{7}{100} \) of a degree × 480 = \( 10 + \frac{7 \times 480}{100} \) degrees.
2. **朔月行定 (Moon's movement per synodic month)**: 9000 (定分, "fixed parts").
3. **朔日定小余 (Moon's daily movement)**: 10000 (定分, "fixed parts").
4. **日法 (Sun's total movement in a year)**: 20000 (定分, "fixed parts").
5. **章歲 (Yearly cycle)**: 700 (also called 行分法, "movement parts law").
6. **No additional time or day adjustments**: We are calculating for the exact midnight of the first day.

---

### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Convert the sun's position to degrees**:
   The sun's position is given as:
   \[
   10 + \frac{7}{100} \times 480 = 10 + \frac{3360}{100} = 10 + 33.6 = 43.6 \, \text{degrees}.
   \]

2. **Calculate the moon's position**:
   The moon's position is determined by its relative movement compared to the sun. The moon moves faster than the sun, and its position is calculated using the following formula:
   \[
   \text{Moon's position} = (\text{Sun's position} + \text{朔月行定} \times \text{朔日定小余} / \text{日法}) \mod 360.
   \]

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Moon's position} = (43.6 + 9000 \times 10000 / 20000) \mod 360.
   \]

3. **Simplify the calculation**:
   First, calculate the fraction:
   \[
   9000 \times 10000 / 20000 = 4500000 / 20000 = 225.
   \]

   Add this to the sun's position:
   \[
   43.6 + 225 = 268.6 \, \text{degrees}.
   \]

4. **Adjust for modulus 360**:
   Since 268.6 is less than 360, no adjustment is needed. The moon's position is:
   \[
   \text{Moon's position} = 268.6 \, \text{degrees}.
   \]

---

### Final Answer:
The moon is at **268.6 degrees**, which corresponds to **a = 268.6** degrees in the Dipper (斗).#----- content ends here -----
