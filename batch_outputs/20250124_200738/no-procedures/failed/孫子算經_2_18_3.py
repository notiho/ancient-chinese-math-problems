Suppose there is a volume of 234,567 cubic bu (步³).
Question: what is the side length of the cube (in bu)?

Answer: the side length is *a* bu.
"""

# Given volume in cubic bu
volume = 234567

# To find the side length of the cube, we need the cube root of the volume.
# Since we cannot use external libraries, we will approximate the cube root manually.

# Start with an initial guess
a = 60  # Initial guess for cube root

# Refine the guess using a simple iterative method (manual approximation)
while a**3 < volume:
    a += 1

# If the cube of the current guess exceeds the volume, step back by 1
if a**3 > volume:
    a -= 1

# Final result
a = Fraction(a)  # Represent the result as a fraction if needed
