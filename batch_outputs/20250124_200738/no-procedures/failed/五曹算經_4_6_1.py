This problem involves calculating the volume of a granary (倉) while accounting for the space taken up by beams (牽) and a pillar (柱). The goal is to determine how much millet (粟) the granary can hold.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Granary dimensions**:
   - Length (從): 1丈3尺 = 13尺
   - Width (廣): 6尺
   - Height (高): 1丈 = 10尺

2. **Beams (牽)**:
   - Two beams along the length, each with a square cross-section of 5寸 × 5寸.
   - Three beams along the width, each with a square cross-section of 4寸 × 4寸.

3. **Pillar (柱)**:
   - One pillar with a circular cross-section, circumference 3尺, and height 1丈 = 10尺.

4. **Volume of the granary**:
   - The total volume of the granary is calculated as:
     \[
     V_{\text{granary}} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height}
     \]

5. **Volume of the beams and pillar**:
   - Subtract the volume of the beams and the pillar from the total granary volume.

6. **Conversion to millet capacity**:
   - 1 cubic chi (尺³) = 1斗 of millet.
   - 10斗 = 1斛.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Granary Volume**:
   - The total volume is calculated as `length * width * height`.

2. **Beams**:
   - The volume of each beam is calculated based on its cross-sectional area and length/width.
   - Multiply by the number of beams in each direction.

3. **Pillar**:
   - The pillar is treated as a cylinder. Its volume is calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: \( V = \pi r^2 h \).

4. **Usable Volume**:
   - Subtract the volume of the beams and the pillar from the total granary volume.

5. **Millet Capacity**:
   - Convert the usable volume (in cubic chi) to millet capacity in hu (斛) and dou (斗).

---

### Final Answer:
The granary can hold:
\[
a \text{斛 奇 } b \text{斗}
\]
