This problem involves distributing the transportation cost (200 hu) proportionally among 9 families based on the amount of rent (in hu) they contributed. Here's the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Rent contributions from each family
甲 = 35
乙 = 46
丙 = 57
丁 = 68
戊 = 79
己 = 80
庚 = 100
辛 = 210
壬 = 325

# Total rent contributed by all families
total_rent = 甲 + 乙 + 丙 + 丁 + 戊 + 己 + 庚 + 辛 + 壬

# Total transportation cost to be distributed
transportation_cost = 200

# Calculate each family's share of the transportation cost
甲_cost = Fraction(甲 * transportation_cost, total_rent)
乙_cost = Fraction(乙 * transportation_cost, total_rent)
丙_cost = Fraction(丙 * transportation_cost, total_rent)
丁_cost = Fraction(丁 * transportation_cost, total_rent)
戊_cost = Fraction(戊 * transportation_cost, total_rent)
己_cost = Fraction(己 * transportation_cost, total_rent)
庚_cost = Fraction(庚 * transportation_cost, total_rent)
辛_cost = Fraction(辛 * transportation_cost, total_rent)
壬_cost = Fraction(壬 * transportation_cost, total_rent)

# Calculate the final amount each family pays (rent contribution + transportation cost share)
甲_final = 甲 + 甲_cost
乙_final = 乙 + 乙_cost
丙_final = 丙 + 丙_cost
丁_final = 丁 + 丁_cost
戊_final = 戊 + 戊_cost
己_final = 己 + 己_cost
庚_final = 庚 + 庚_cost
辛_final = 辛 + 辛_cost
壬_final = 壬 + 壬_cost

# Results
a = 甲_final
b = 乙_final
c = 丙_final
d = 丁_final
e = 戊_final
f = 己_final
g = 庚_final
h = 辛_final
i = 壬_final

# Output
a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i

### Explanation:
1. Each family's share of the transportation cost is proportional to their rent contribution. This is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Family's Share of Cost} = \frac{\text{Family's Rent Contribution} \times \text{Total Transportation Cost}}{\text{Total Rent}}
   \]

2. The final amount each family pays is their original rent contribution plus their share of the transportation cost.

### Example Output:
The results will be fractions representing the final amounts each family pays.
