This problem involves calculating the price per unit weight of silk based on the total cost and total weight. Let's break it down step by step:

### Problem:
- Total money spent: 13,970 (錢)
- Total weight of silk: 1 石, 2 鈞, 28 斤, 3 兩, 5 銖
- Question: What is the price per 斤 (jin) and per 鈞 (jun)?

---

### Step 1: Convert all weights to a single unit (斤, jin)
1 石 = 4 鈞  
1 鈞 = 30 斤  
1 斤 = 16 兩  
1 兩 = 24 銖  

So, the total weight in 斤 is:

\[
\text{Total weight in 斤} = (1 \times 4 \times 30) + (2 \times 30) + 28 + \frac{3}{16} + \frac{5}{(16 \times 24)}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the price per 斤 (jin)
The price per 斤 is the total money divided by the total weight in 斤.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the price per 鈞 (jun)
The price per 鈞 is the total money divided by the total weight in 鈞.

---

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total money spent
total_money = 13970  # 錢

# Convert total weight to 斤 (jin)
weight_in_jin = (1 * 4 * 30) + (2 * 30) + 28 + Fraction(3, 16) + Fraction(5, (16 * 24))

# Calculate price per 斤 (jin)
price_per_jin = Fraction(total_money, weight_in_jin)

# Convert total weight to 鈞 (jun)
weight_in_jun = weight_in_jin / 30

# Calculate price per 鈞 (jun)
price_per_jun = Fraction(total_money, weight_in_jun)

# Results
a = price_per_jin  # Price per 斤
b = price_per_jun  # Price per 鈞

# Output
print(f"Price per 斤 (jin): {a} 錢")
print(f"Price per 鈞 (jun): {b} 錢")
#----- content ends here -----

### Explanation of Variables:
- `total_money`: The total amount of money spent (13,970 錢).
- `weight_in_jin`: The total weight converted to 斤 (jin).
- `price_per_jin`: The price per 斤 (jin), calculated as `total_money / weight_in_jin`.
- `weight_in_jun`: The total weight converted to 鈞 (jun).
- `price_per_jun`: The price per 鈞 (jun), calculated as `total_money / weight_in_jun`.

---

### Final Answer:
After running the code, you will get the values for:
- `a`: Price per 斤 (jin)
- `b`: Price per 鈞 (jun)
