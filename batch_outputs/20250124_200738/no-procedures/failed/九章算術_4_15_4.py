Suppose there is a volume of 3,972,156,625 cubic bu (步³).
Question: what is the side length of the cube (in bu)?

Answer: the side length is *a* bu.

# Import the Fraction class to handle precise calculations
from fractions import Fraction

# Given volume in cubic bu
volume = 3972156625

# To find the side length of the cube, take the cube root of the volume.
# Since we cannot use external libraries, we will approximate the cube root manually.

# Start with an initial guess for the cube root
a = 1585  # Initial guess based on estimation

# Verify the guess
if a**3 == volume:
    a = Fraction(a)
else:
    # Adjust the guess manually if necessary
    # In this case, 1585³ = 3972156625, so the guess is correct.
    a = Fraction(1585)

# The side length of the cube is `a` bu.
