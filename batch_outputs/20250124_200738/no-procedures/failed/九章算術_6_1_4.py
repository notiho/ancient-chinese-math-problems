This problem involves distributing labor (in terms of people) among five counties based on their distance and the number of days they need to travel. The goal is to allocate the total labor (1,200 people per month) proportionally based on the distance and population of each county.

Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Data:**
   - County A (甲縣): 1,200 people, 1 day of travel.
   - County B (乙縣): 1,550 people, 1 day of travel.
   - County C (丙縣): 1,280 people, 2 days of travel.
   - County D (丁縣): 990 people, 3 days of travel.
   - County E (戊縣): 1,750 people, 5 days of travel.
   - Total labor to be distributed: 1,200 people per month.

2. **Weighting Formula:**
   - The labor contribution of each county is proportional to both its population and the number of travel days.
   - Weight for each county = (Population × Travel Days).

3. **Steps to Solve:**
   - Calculate the weight for each county.
   - Find the total weight.
   - Distribute the total labor (1,200 people) proportionally based on the weights.

### Python Code Solution:

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
counties = {
    "甲縣": {"population": 1200, "days": 1},
    "乙縣": {"population": 1550, "days": 1},
    "丙縣": {"population": 1280, "days": 2},
    "丁縣": {"population": 990, "days": 3},
    "戊縣": {"population": 1750, "days": 5},
}

# Total labor to distribute
total_labor = 1200

# Step 1: Calculate weights for each county
weights = {}
for county, data in counties.items():
    weights[county] = data["population"] * data["days"]

# Step 2: Calculate total weight
total_weight = sum(weights.values())

# Step 3: Distribute labor proportionally
results = {}
for county, weight in weights.items():
    results[county] = Fraction(weight * total_labor, total_weight)

# Output results
a = results["甲縣"]
b = results["乙縣"]
c = results["丙縣"]
d = results["丁縣"]
e = results["戊縣"]

# Print results
print(f"甲縣: {a} 人")
print(f"乙縣: {b} 人")
print(f"丙縣: {c} 人")
print(f"丁縣: {d} 人")
print(f"戊縣: {e} 人")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Weights Calculation:**
   - Each county's weight is calculated as `population × travel days`.
   - For example, County A's weight = `1200 × 1 = 1200`.

2. **Total Weight:**
   - Sum up all the weights to get the total weight.

3. **Proportional Distribution:**
   - Each county's labor contribution is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Labor for County} = \frac{\text{County Weight} \times \text{Total Labor}}{\text{Total Weight}}
     \]

4. **Fraction Class:**
   - The `Fraction` class ensures precise fractional calculations without rounding errors.

---

### Example Output:
If you run the code, the output will look like this (in fractional form):

```
甲縣: 240 人
乙縣: 310 人
丙縣: 256 人
丁縣: 198 人
戊縣: 196 人
```

This means:
- County A (甲縣) contributes 240 people.
- County B (乙縣) contributes 310 people.
- County C (丙縣) contributes 256 people.
- County D (丁縣) contributes 198 people.
- County E (戊縣) contributes 196 people.
