This problem involves proportional distribution of resources (grain and carts) based on the population of each county, the distance they need to travel, and the total grain and carts available.

### Problem Breakdown:
- Four counties (甲, 乙, 丙, 丁) have different populations and travel distances.
- Total grain to be distributed: **250,000 hu**.
- Total carts to be distributed: **10,000 carts**.
- The distribution is proportional to the product of the number of households and the distance traveled.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define the data for each county**:
   - 甲縣: 10,000 households, 8 days of travel.
   - 乙縣: 9,500 households, 10 days of travel.
   - 丙縣: 12,350 households, 13 days of travel.
   - 丁縣: 12,200 households, 20 days of travel.

2. **Calculate the proportional weight for each county**:
   - The weight for each county is the product of the number of households and the travel distance.

3. **Distribute the total grain and carts proportionally**:
   - Use the weights to calculate the share of grain and carts for each county.

from fractions import Fraction

# Data for each county
counties = [
    {"households": 10000, "distance": 8},    # 甲縣
    {"households": 9500, "distance": 10},   # 乙縣
    {"households": 12350, "distance": 13},  # 丙縣
    {"households": 12200, "distance": 20},  # 丁縣

# Total grain and carts
total_grain = 250000  # hu

# Step 1: Calculate weights for each county

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Weights**: The weight for each county is calculated as `households * distance`.
2. **Total Weight**: The sum of all weights is used to determine the proportion for each county.
3. **Proportional Distribution**: Each county's share of grain and carts is calculated as:
   - Grain share = `(county weight / total weight) * total grain`
   - Cart share = `(county weight / total weight) * total carts`
4. **Fractions**: The `Fraction` class is used to ensure exact results without floating-point errors.

---

### Example Output:
If you run the code, the output will look something like this (in exact fractions):
```
甲縣粟 40000/1斛 ，車 1600/1乘 。
乙縣粟 38000/1斛 ，車 1520/1乘 。
丙縣粟 64275/1斛 ，車 2571/1乘 。
丁縣粟 107725/1斛 ，車 4289/1乘 。
```

This provides the exact distribution of grain and carts for each county.
