今有望清淵，淵下有白石。偃矩岸上，令句高三尺。斜望水岸，入下股四尺五寸。望白石，入下股二尺四寸。又設重矩于上，其間相去四尺。更從句端斜望水岸，入上股四尺。以望白石，入上股二尺二寸。問水深幾何？
答曰： a丈 。

This is a classic ancient Chinese problem involving geometry and similar triangles to calculate the depth of water. Let's break it down and solve step by step.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. A right triangle is formed by the measuring tools (矩) and the water's surface.
2. The problem uses two setups of measuring tools (偃矩 and 重矩) to observe the white stone at the bottom of the water.
3. Using the given measurements, we can calculate the depth of the water by applying the principle of similar triangles.

---

### Given Data:
1. In the first setup:
   - The height of the measuring tool (句高) is 3 尺.
   - The distance from the water's edge to the projection of the white stone (入下股) is 4 尺 5 寸 (convert to 尺: \(4 + \frac{5}{10} = 4.5\) 尺).
   - The distance from the water's edge to the projection of the white stone when looking at the stone (入下股 for the stone) is 2 尺 4 寸 (convert to 尺: \(2 + \frac{4}{10} = 2.4\) 尺).

2. In the second setup:
   - The second measuring tool is placed 4 尺 away from the first tool.
   - The height of the second tool is unknown but can be calculated using similar triangles.
   - The distance from the water's edge to the projection of the white stone (入上股) is 4 尺.
   - The distance from the water's edge to the projection of the white stone when looking at the stone (入上股 for the stone) is 2 尺 2 寸 (convert to 尺: \(2 + \frac{2}{10} = 2.2\) 尺).

---

### Goal:
Calculate the depth of the water (\(a\)) in 丈 (1 丈 = 10 尺).

---

### Solution in Python:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# First setup
句高_1 = 3  # Height of the first measuring tool in 尺
入下股_1_岸 = Fraction(4, 1) + Fraction(5, 10)  # Distance to water's edge (4 尺 5 寸)
入下股_1_石 = Fraction(2, 1) + Fraction(4, 10)  # Distance to white stone (2 尺 4 寸)

# Second setup
句高_2 = 句高_1  # Height of the second measuring tool is the same
矩間距 = 4  # Distance between the two measuring tools in 尺
入上股_2_岸 = Fraction(4, 1)  # Distance to water's edge (4 尺)
入上股_2_石 = Fraction(2, 1) + Fraction(2, 10)  # Distance to white stone (2 尺 2 寸)

# Step 1: Calculate the depth of the water using similar triangles
# Using the first setup
水深_1 = 句高_1 * 入下股_1_石 / (入下股_1_岸 - 入下股_1_石)

# Using the second setup
水深_2 = 句高_2 * 入上股_2_石 / (入上股_2_岸 - 入上股_2_石)

# The two calculations should give the same result, so we can use either
水深 = 水深_1  # or 水深_2

# Convert depth to 丈 (1 丈 = 10 尺)
a = 水深 / 10

# Output the result
a

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Convert Measurements**: All measurements are converted to fractions for precise calculations.
2. **Similar Triangles**: The depth of the water is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{水深} = \frac{\text{句高} \times \text{入股石}}{\text{入股岸} - \text{入股石}}
   \]
   This formula is derived from the properties of similar triangles.
3. **Final Conversion**: The depth is converted from 尺 to 丈 by dividing by 10.

---

### Final Answer:
The depth of the water (\(a\)) is calculated in 丈.
