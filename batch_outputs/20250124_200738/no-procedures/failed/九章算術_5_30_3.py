Suppose there is a pile of beans leaning against a wall. The base circumference is 3 zhang, and the height is 7 chi.
Question: what is the volume of the pile, and how many hu of beans does it represent?

Answer: the volume is *a* cubic chi, and it represents *b* hu of beans.

# 下周三丈 (base circumference is 3 zhang)
周 = 3 * 10  # Convert zhang to chi (1 zhang = 10 chi)

# 高七尺 (height is 7 chi)
高 = 7

# The volume of a cone is (1/3) * base_area * height.
# The base area of a circle is (周 / (2 * pi))^2 * pi = (周^2) / (4 * pi).
# Simplify the formula for the volume: (1/3) * (周^2) / (4 * pi) * 高 = (周^2 * 高) / (12 * pi).

# For simplicity, we approximate pi as 3.
pi = 3
積 = Fraction(周**2 * 高, 12 * pi)

# Convert the volume from cubic chi to hu (1 hu = 10 cubic chi)
為菽 = 積 / 10

# Final results
a = 積  # Volume in cubic chi
b = 為菽  # Volume in hu of beans#----- content ends here -----
