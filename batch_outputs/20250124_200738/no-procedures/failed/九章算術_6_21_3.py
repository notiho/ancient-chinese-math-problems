Suppose one person can make 38 male tiles (牡瓦) in one day, and one person can make 76 female tiles (牝瓦) in one day.
Now, if one person is tasked to make tiles such that the number of male and female tiles is equal (half male, half female), how many tiles can they make in one day?

Answer: *a* tiles.
