Suppose there is a pile of rice leaning against the inner corner of a wall. 
The base circumference is 8 chi, and the height is 5 chi.
Question: what is the volume of the pile, and how much rice does it represent?

Answer: the volume is *a* cubic chi, and it represents *b* hu and *c* dou of rice.

# 下周八尺 (base circumference)
base_circumference = 8

# 高五尺 (height)
height = 5

# Calculate the radius of the base (circumference = 2 * pi * r)
# For simplicity, assume pi = 3 (as was common in ancient Chinese calculations)
pi = 3
radius = base_circumference / (2 * pi)

# Volume of a cone: V = (1/3) * pi * r^2 * h
volume = Fraction(1, 3) * pi * radius**2 * height

# Convert volume to rice (1 cubic chi = 1 hu of rice)
# 1 hu = 10 dou
rice_in_hu = int(volume)  # Whole number part is in hu
rice_in_dou = (volume - rice_in_hu) * 10  # Remaining part converted to dou

a = volume
b = rice_in_hu
