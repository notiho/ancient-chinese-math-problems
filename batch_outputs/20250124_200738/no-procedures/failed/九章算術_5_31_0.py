Suppose there is a pile of rice placed in the inner corner of a wall. The base circumference is 8 chi, and the height is 5 chi.
Question: what is the volume of the pile, and how much rice does it represent?

Answer: the volume is *a* cubic chi, and it represents *b* hu and *c* dou of rice.

# 下周八尺 (base circumference)
base_circumference = 8

# 高五尺 (height)
height = 5

# Calculate the radius of the base (circumference = 2 * pi * r, but simplified for a quarter-circle in the corner)
# Since it's a quarter-circle, the circumference formula is (1/2) * 2 * pi * r = pi * r
# Solving for r: r = base_circumference / pi
# For simplicity, we approximate pi as 3
radius = Fraction(base_circumference, 3)

# The volume of a quarter-cylinder is (1/4) * pi * r^2 * h
# Using pi ≈ 3, the formula simplifies to (1/4) * 3 * r^2 * h = (3/4) * r^2 * h
volume = Fraction(3, 4) * radius**2 * height

# Convert the volume into hu and dou
# 1 hu = 10 dou, and 1 hu = 10 cubic chi
b = volume // 10  # Number of hu
c = volume % 10   # Remaining dou

# Final results
a = volume  # Volume in cubic chi
b = b       # Number of hu
c = c       # Number of dou#----- content ends here -----
