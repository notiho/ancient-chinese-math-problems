Suppose there are 9 pieces of gold and 11 pieces of silver, and their total weight is equal.
If one piece of gold is exchanged for one piece of silver, the gold becomes 13 liang lighter.
Question: how much does one piece of gold and one piece of silver weigh?

Answer: one piece of gold weighs *a* jin, and one piece of silver weighs *b* jin.
"""

# Let the weight of one piece of gold be x jin
# Let the weight of one piece of silver be y jin

# Total weight of gold = 9x
# Total weight of silver = 11y
# Given: 9x = 11y (total weights are equal)

# After exchanging one piece of gold for one piece of silver:
# New weight of gold = 8x
# New weight of silver = 12y
# Difference in weight = 13 liang = 13/16 jin (since 1 jin = 16 liang)
# Equation: 8x = 12y - 13/16

from fractions import Fraction

# Solve the equations:
# 1. 9x = 11y
# 2. 8x = 12y - 13/16

# From the first equation: y = 9x / 11
y = Fraction(9, 11)

# Substitute y into the second equation:
# 8x = 12(9x / 11) - 13/16
# 8x = 108x / 11 - 13/16
# Multiply through by 176 (common denominator of 11 and 16):
# 176 * 8x = 176 * 108x / 11 - 176 * 13/16
# 1408x = 1728x - 143
# 1408x - 1728x = -143
# -320x = -143
# x = 143 / 320

x = Fraction(143, 320)

# Substitute x back into y = 9x / 11:
y = Fraction(9 * x, 11)

# Final results:
a = x  # Weight of one piece of gold in jin
b = y  # Weight of one piece of silver in jin

a, b  # Output the results#----- content ends here -----
