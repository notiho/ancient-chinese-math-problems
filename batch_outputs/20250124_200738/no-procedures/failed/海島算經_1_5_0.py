今有東南望波口，立兩表南、北相去九丈，以索薄地連之。當北表之西卻行去表六丈，薄地遙望波口南岸，入索北端四丈二寸。以望北岸，入前所望表里一丈二尺。又卻後行去表一十三丈五尺。薄地遙望波口南岸，與南表參合。問波口廣幾何？
答曰： a里 。

This is a classic ancient Chinese surveying problem involving geometry and trigonometry. The problem describes a situation where measurements are taken using poles, ropes, and observations to determine the width of a river (波口廣). Let's break it down and solve it step by step.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. Two poles (南表 and 北表) are placed 9 丈 apart (南北相去九丈).
2. A rope is stretched between the poles (索薄地連之).
3. Observations are made from different positions west of the northern pole (北表之西):
   - At 6 丈 west of the northern pole, the rope's southern end (索北端) is observed to be 4 丈 2 寸 (4.2 丈) from the southern bank.
   - From the same position, the northern bank is observed to be 1 丈 2 尺 (1.2 丈) inside the northern pole.
4. Moving further west to 13 丈 5 尺 (13.5 丈) from the northern pole, the southern bank aligns with the southern pole (南表參合).
5. The goal is to calculate the width of the river (波口廣).

---

### Assumptions:
- 1 丈 = 10 尺, and 1 尺 = 10 寸.
- The problem involves similar triangles and proportional reasoning.

---

### Solution:

We will calculate the width of the river step by step using the given data.


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Step 1: Define the given measurements
南北距離 = 9  # Distance between the two poles (in 丈)
第一次觀測距離 = 6  # Distance west of the northern pole during the first observation (in 丈)
第一次南岸距離 = Fraction(42, 10)  # Distance from the southern bank to the rope's northern end (in 丈, converted from 丈 and 寸)
第一次北岸距離 = Fraction(12, 10)  # Distance from the northern bank to the northern pole (in 丈, converted from 丈 and 尺)
第二次觀測距離 = Fraction(135, 10)  # Distance west of the northern pole during the second observation (in 丈, converted from 丈 and 尺)

# Step 2: Calculate the width of the river (波口廣)
# Using similar triangles:
# (Width of the river) / (南北距離) = (第一次南岸距離 + 第一次北岸距離) / 第一次觀測距離
波口廣 = 南北距離 * (第一次南岸距離 + 第一次北岸距離) / 第一次觀測距離

# Convert the result to 丈
波口廣_in_丈 = 波口廣

# Convert the result to 里 (1 里 = 300 丈)
波口廣_in_里 = 波口廣 / 300

# Output the result
波口廣_in_里

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input the Measurements**: All measurements are converted into consistent units (丈) for calculation.
2. **Use Similar Triangles**: The width of the river is proportional to the distances observed and the distances between the poles.
3. **Convert to 里**: Since the final answer is requested in 里, the result is divided by 300 (1 里 = 300 丈).

---

### Final Answer:
The width of the river (波口廣) is `a` 里, where `a` is the result of the calculation above.
