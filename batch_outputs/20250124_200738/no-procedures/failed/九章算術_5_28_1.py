This problem involves calculating the volume of a trapezoidal valley and then determining the labor required to transport the soil. Let's break it into two parts:

---

### Part 1: Calculate the volume of the valley

The valley is trapezoidal in shape, so its volume can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a trapezoidal prism:

\[
V = \frac{1}{2} \times (上廣 + 下廣) \times 深 \times 袤
\]

Where:
- 上廣 = 2 丈 = 20 尺
- 下廣 = 8 尺
- 深 = 6 丈 5 尺 = 65 尺
- 袤 = (7 丈 + 4 丈) = 11 丈 = 110 尺

---

### Part 2: Calculate labor requirements

Given:
- Total volume = 52000 尺 (as stated in the problem)
- Each cart carries **34 尺 7 寸**, which is \( 34 + \frac{7}{10} = 34.7 \) 尺.
- 6 people share one cart.
- Distance for one trip = 1 里 = 300 步.
- Total distance = 58 里.
- Total trips = \( \frac{\text{Total volume}}{\text{Volume per cart}} = \frac{52000}{34.7} \).

We need to calculate:
1. The total distance traveled by each person (人到 a 尺).
2. The total number of workers required (用徒 b 人).

### Explanation of Results:
1. **Volume of the valley (積):** \( 52000 \) 尺 (as given in the problem).
2. **Total trips required:** Calculated based on the cart capacity.
3. **Total distance traveled by each person (人到):** The total distance each person travels in 步.
4. **Total workers required (用徒):** The number of workers needed to transport the soil.
