今有南望方邑，不知大小。立兩表東、西去六丈，齊人目，以索連之。令東表與邑東南隅及東北隅參相直。當東表之北卻行五步，遙望邑西北隅，入索東端二丈二尺六寸半。又卻北行去表一十三步二尺，遙望邑西北隅，適與西表相參合。問邑方及邑去表各幾何？
答曰：邑方 a里 ；邑去表 b里 。

This is a classic ancient Chinese surveying problem involving geometry and similar triangles. Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. Two poles (東表 and 西表) are placed 6 丈 apart.
2. Observations are made from specific points north of the eastern pole (東表) to determine the alignment of the poles with the corners of the square city (邑).
3. The problem uses the concept of similar triangles to calculate:
   - The side length of the square city (邑方, denoted as `a`).
   - The distance from the poles to the city (邑去表, denoted as `b`).

---

### Known Data:
- Distance between the poles: `6 丈` (東表 to 西表).
- First observation:
  - Observer moves 5 步 north of the 東表.
  - The rope (索) is pulled 2 丈 2 尺 6 寸半 into the city (converted to a fraction of 丈).
- Second observation:
  - Observer moves 13 步 2 尺 north of the 東表.
  - The line of sight aligns with the 西表 and the city’s northwest corner.

---

### Assumptions:
1. 1 丈 = 10 尺, and 1 尺 = 10 寸.
2. 1 里 = 300 丈.

### Python Code:

# Using similar triangles to calculate:
# Let `a` be the side length of the city (邑方) in 丈.
# Let `b` be the distance from the poles to the city (邑去表) in 丈.

# From the first observation:
# (a / b) = (pole_distance / (b + first_observer_distance)) = (6 / (b + first_observer_distance))
# a = 6 * b / (b + first_observer_distance)

# From the second observation:
# (a / b) = ((pole_distance + first_rope_pull) / (b + second_observer_distance))
# a = (pole_distance + first_rope_pull) * b / (b + second_observer_distance)

# Solve for `b` by equating the two expressions for `a`:
# 6 * b / (b + first_observer_distance) = (pole_distance + first_rope_pull) * b / (b + second_observer_distance)
