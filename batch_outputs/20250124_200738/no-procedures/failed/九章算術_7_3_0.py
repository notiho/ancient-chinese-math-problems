Suppose there are two scenarios for buying a cow:
1. Seven families together contribute 190, which is less than 330.
2. Nine families together contribute 270, which is 30 more than the required amount.

Question: How many families (a) and what is the price of the cow (b)?

Answer: *a* families, and the price of the cow is *b*.
"""

# Let x be the number of families and y be the price of the cow.

# From the first condition: 7 families contribute 190, which is less than 330.
# This implies: 7y = 330 - 190
first_condition = 330 - 190

# From the second condition: 9 families contribute 270, which is 30 more than the required amount.
# This implies: 9y = 270 - 30
