今有望清淵，淵下有白石。偃矩岸上，令句高三尺。斜望水岸，入下股四尺五寸。望白石，入下股二尺四寸。又設重矩于上，其間相去四尺。更從句端斜望水岸，入上股四尺。以望白石，入上股二尺二寸。問水深幾何？

This is a classic ancient Chinese mathematics problem involving geometry and similar triangles to calculate the depth of water. Let's break it down step by step and solve it.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. A right-angled triangle is formed by the measuring tools (矩) and the water's surface.
2. The problem involves two setups:
   - In the first setup, the height of the measuring tool (句) is 3 chi, and the distances along the horizontal (股) are given for viewing the water's edge and the white stone.
   - In the second setup, another measuring tool is placed 4 chi above the first one, and similar measurements are taken.

3. Using the principle of similar triangles, we calculate the depth of the water.

---

### Given Data:
1. First setup:
   - Height of the tool (句高): 3 chi.
   - Horizontal distance to the water's edge: 4 chi 5 cun = \( 4 + \frac{5}{10} = 4.5 \) chi.
   - Horizontal distance to the white stone: 2 chi 4 cun = \( 2 + \frac{4}{10} = 2.4 \) chi.

2. Second setup:
   - Height of the second tool (句高): \( 3 + 4 = 7 \) chi.
   - Horizontal distance to the water's edge: 4 chi = 4 chi.
   - Horizontal distance to the white stone: 2 chi 2 cun = \( 2 + \frac{2}{10} = 2.2 \) chi.

3. Goal: Calculate the depth of the water (水深).

---

### Solution:

We use the principle of similar triangles. Let the depth of the water be \( a \) (in chi). The key relationship is:

\[
\text{Depth of water} = \frac{\text{Difference in heights of the tools}}{\text{Difference in horizontal distances to the white stone}} \times \text{Horizontal distance to the white stone in the first setup}.
\]

### Python Code:

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# First setup
height_1 = 3  # chi
distance_edge_1 = Fraction(45, 10)  # 4 chi 5 cun = 4.5 chi
distance_stone_1 = Fraction(24, 10)  # 2 chi 4 cun = 2.4 chi

# Second setup
height_2 = 7  # chi
distance_edge_2 = 4  # 4 chi
distance_stone_2 = Fraction(22, 10)  # 2 chi 2 cun = 2.2 chi

# Calculate the depth of the water
height_difference = height_2 - height_1
distance_difference = distance_stone_1 - distance_stone_2

# Depth of the water
a = height_difference / distance_difference * distance_stone_1

# Convert to zhang (1 zhang = 10 chi)
a_in_zhang = a / 10

# Output the result
a_in_zhang

"""


---

### Explanation of the Code:
1. Convert all measurements to fractions for precise calculations.
2. Use the difference in heights and the difference in horizontal distances to calculate the depth using similar triangles.
3. Convert the result from chi to zhang (1 zhang = 10 chi).

---

### Final Answer:
The depth of the water is \( a \) zhang, where \( a \) is the result of the calculation in the code above.
