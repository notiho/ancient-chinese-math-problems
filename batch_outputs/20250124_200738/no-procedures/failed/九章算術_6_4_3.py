今有粟七斗，三人分舂之，一人為糲米，一人為粺米，一人為鑿米，令米數等。問︰取粟為米各幾何？
荅曰：糲米取粟 a斗 。粺米取粟 b斗 。鑿米取粟 c斗 。為米各 d斗 。

Suppose there are 7 dou of millet, and three people are tasked with processing it. 
One person makes roughly husked millet (糲米), one makes finely husked millet (粺米), and one makes polished millet (鑿米). 
The resulting amount of millet for each person must be equal.

Question: how much millet does each person take to process, and how much millet does each person produce?

Answer: 糲米取粟 *a* dou, 粺米取粟 *b* dou, 鑿米取粟 *c* dou, and each produces *d* dou of millet.

from fractions import Fraction

# Total millet
total_millet = 7

# Conversion rates:
# 糲米: 3/5 of the millet remains after processing
# 粺米: 2/5 of the millet remains after processing
# 鑿米: 1/5 of the millet remains after processing

# Let the amount of millet taken by each person be a, b, and c respectively
# The resulting millet for each person must be equal, so:
# a * 3/5 = b * 2/5 = c * 1/5 = d (the resulting millet for each person)

# Solve for a, b, and c in terms of d
a = Fraction(5, 3) * d
b = Fraction(5, 2) * d
c = Fraction(5, 1) * d

# The total millet taken must equal 7 dou:
# a + b + c = 7
# (5/3)d + (5/2)d + (5/1)d = 7

# Find the common denominator and solve for d
common_denominator = 6
total = Fraction(5, 3) + Fraction(5, 2) + Fraction(5, 1)
d = Fraction(total_millet, total)

# Calculate a, b, c, and d
a = Fraction(5, 3) * d
b = Fraction(5, 2) * d
c = Fraction(5, 1) * d

# Output results
a, b, c, d#----- content ends here -----
