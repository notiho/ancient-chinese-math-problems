Suppose there is a total of 13,970 qian spent to buy silk weighing 1 shi, 2 jun, 28 jin, 3 liang, and 5 zhu.
It is desired to calculate the price per shi and per jun.
Question: What is the price per jun and per shi?

Answer: The price per jun is *a* qian, and the price per shi is *b* qian.
The price for the entire silk (1 shi) is *c* qian, and the price for the remaining weight is *d* qian.
