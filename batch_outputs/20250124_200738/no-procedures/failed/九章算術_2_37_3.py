Suppose there is a total of 576 qian (coins) used to buy 78 bamboo pieces.
It is desired to divide them into two groups based on size and price per piece.
Question: how many pieces are in each group, and what is the price per piece?

Answer: *a* pieces at *b* qian per piece, and *c* pieces at *d* qian per piece.

# Total money and total bamboo pieces
total_money = 576
total_bamboo = 78

# Assume the two groups have the following characteristics:
# Group 1: a pieces at b qian per piece
# Group 2: c pieces at d qian per piece

# Let:
# Group 1 has 48 pieces at 8 qian per piece
# Group 2 has 30 pieces at 12 qian per piece

a = 48
b = 8
c = 30
d = 12

# Verify the solution:
assert a + c == total_bamboo  # Total pieces must match
assert a * b + c * d == total_money  # Total money must match#----- content ends here -----
