A rope is stretched across the ground between the two poles.\n3. Observations are made from different positions west of the northern pole, measuring how far the rope is \"entered\" (intersects) when sighting the riverbanks.\n\n---\n\n### Variables:\n- Distance between the two poles: `9 \u4e08`\n- First observation:\n  - Observer moves west of the northern pole: `6 \u4e08`\n  - Rope enters the northern end: `4 \u4e08 2 \u5bf8` = \\(4 + \\frac{2}{10} = 4.2 \u4e08\\)\n  - Rope enters the southern end: `1 \u4e08 2 \u5c3a` = \\(1 + \\frac{2}{10} = 1.2 \u4e08\\)\n- Second observation:\n  - Observer moves further west of the northern pole: `13 \u4e08 5 \u5c3a` = \\(13 + \\frac{5}{10} = 13.5 \u4e08\\)\n  - Rope aligns with the southern pole.\n\n---\n\n### Goal:\nCalculate the width of the river (\u6ce2\u53e3\u5ee3), denoted as \\(a\\), in \u91cc (1 \u91cc = 300 \u4e08).\n\n---\n\n### Solution:\n\nWe will use proportions and geometry to calculate the width of the river. The key is to recognize that the observations form similar triangles.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Given data\ndistance_between_poles = 9  # \u4e08\nfirst_observer_distance = 6  # \u4e08\nfirst_rope_north_entry = Fraction(42, 10)  # 4 \u4e08 2 \u5bf8 = 4.2 \u4e08\nfirst_rope_south_entry = Fraction(12, 10)  # 1 \u4e08 2 \u5c3a = 1.2 \u4e08\nsecond_observer_distance = Fraction(135, 10)  # 13 \u4e08 5 \u5c3a = 13.5 \u4e08\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the width of the river using similar triangles\n# Let the width of the river be `a` (in \u4e08)\n\n# From the first observation:\n# Triangle formed by the northern pole, the observer, and the northern riverbank\n# Width of the river (a) is proportional to the distances:\n# a / (first_rope_north_entry) = (first_observer_distance) / (distance_between_poles)\n\na_north = (first_rope_north_entry * first_observer_distance) / distance_between_poles\n\n# From the second observation:\n# Triangle formed by the southern pole, the observer, and the southern riverbank\n# a / (distance_between_poles) = (second_observer_distance) / (distance_between_poles)\n\na_south = (second_observer_distance * first_rope_south_entry) \n\n# Final width of the river (a)\na = a_north + a_south\n\n# Convert to \u91cc (1 \u91cc = 300 \u4e08)\na_in_li = a / 300\n\n# Output the result\na_in_li\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **First Observation**: Using the proportions of the triangle formed by the northern pole, the observer, and the northern riverbank, we calculate the partial width of the river.\n2. **Second Observation**: Using the proportions of the triangle formed by the southern pole, the observer, and the southern riverbank, we calculate the remaining width of the river.\n3. **Combine Results**: Add the two partial widths to get the total width of the river.\n4. **Convert to \u91cc**: Since the result is in \u4e08, we divide by 300 to convert it to \u91cc.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe width of the river is \\(a\\) \u91cc.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1080, "completion_tokens": 3772, "total_tokens": 4852, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ec7eab8ec3"}}, "error": null}
