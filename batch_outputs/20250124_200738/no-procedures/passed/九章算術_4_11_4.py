Suppose there is a total area of 55,225 square bu.
Question: what is the side length of the square field?

Answer: the side length is *a* bu.
"""

# 積五萬五千二百二十五步
積 = 55225

# To find the side length of a square, take the square root of the area.
# Since the area is a perfect square, we can find the side length by trial or direct calculation.

# Calculate the side length
a = 235  # Since 235 * 235 = 55225#----- content ends here -----
