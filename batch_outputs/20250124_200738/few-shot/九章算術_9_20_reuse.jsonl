Person B walks *c* steps east.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Rates of movement\n\u7532\u901f = 5  # Person A's rate\n\u4e59\u901f = 3  # Person B's rate\n\n# City dimensions\n\u9091\u65b9 = 10  # Side length of the city in li\n\u9091\u65b9\u534a = Fraction(\u9091\u65b9, 2)  # Half the side length\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the diagonal movement rate\n\u7532\u901f\u5e73\u65b9 = \u7532\u901f ** 2\n\u4e59\u901f\u5e73\u65b9 = \u4e59\u901f ** 2\n\u90aa\u884c\u7387 = Fraction(\u7532\u901f\u5e73\u65b9 +\u4e59\u901f\u5e73\u65b9, 2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the southward movement rate\n\u5357\u884c\u7387 = \u7532\u901f\u5e73\u65b9 - \u90aa\u884c\u7387\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the eastward movement rate\n\u6771\u884c\u7387 = \u4e59\u901f * \u7532\u901f\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the steps Person A takes to exit the south gate\n\u5357\u9580\u6b65\u6578 = Fraction(\u9091\u65b9\u534a * \u5357\u884c\u7387, \u6771\u884c\u7387)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the total southward movement of Person A\n\u5357\u884c = \u5357\u9580\u6b65\u6578 + \u9091\u65b9\u534a\n\n# Step 6: Calculate the diagonal movement of Person A\n\u90aa\u884c = Fraction(\u5357\u884c * \u90aa\u884c\u7387, \u5357\u884c\u7387)\n\n# Step 7: Calculate the eastward movement of Person B\n\u6771\u884c = Fraction(\u5357\u884c * \u6771\u884c\u7387, \u5357\u884c\u7387)\n\n# Final results\na = \u5357\u884c\nb = \u90aa\u884c\nc = \u6771\u884c", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2013, "completion_tokens": 3204, "total_tokens": 5217, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_60a3f2dc65"}}, "error": null}
