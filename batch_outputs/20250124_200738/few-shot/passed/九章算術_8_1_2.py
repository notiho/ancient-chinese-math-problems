今有上禾七秉，損實一斗，益之下禾二秉，而實一十斗。下禾八秉，益實一斗與上禾二秉，而實一十斗。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程。損之曰益，益之曰損。損實一斗者，其實過一十斗也。益實一斗者，其實不滿一十斗也。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a斗 ，下禾一秉實 b斗 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations to determine the yield of one bundle of upper millet (*上禾*) and one bundle of lower millet (*下禾*). The procedure describes a method akin to Gaussian elimination to solve the equations. Let's translate this into Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Problem setup:
# Equation 1: 7 bundles of upper millet lose 1 dou, and adding 2 bundles of lower millet results in 10 dou.
# Equation 2: 8 bundles of lower millet gain 1 dou, and adding 2 bundles of upper millet results in 10 dou.

# Let x = yield of one bundle of upper millet (上禾)
# Let y = yield of one bundle of lower millet (下禾)

# Translate the equations:
# 7x - 1 + 2y = 10  ->  7x + 2y = 11
# 8y + 1 + 2x = 10  ->  2x + 8y = 9

# Coefficients of the equations:
# 7x + 2y = 11
# 2x + 8y = 9

# Step 1: Eliminate x from the second equation.
# Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 7 to align the coefficients of x.
eq1_mult = [7 * 2, 2 * 2, 11 * 2]  # 14x + 4y = 22
eq2_mult = [2 * 7, 8 * 7, 9 * 7]   # 14x + 56y = 63

# Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate x.
# (14x + 56y) - (14x + 4y) = 63 - 22
y_coeff = eq2_mult[1] - eq1_mult[1]  # 56y - 4y = 52y
constant = eq2_mult[2] - eq1_mult[2]  # 63 - 22 = 41

# Solve for y:
y = Fraction(constant, y_coeff)  # y = 41 / 52

# Step 2: Substitute y back into the first equation to solve for x.
# 7x + 2y = 11
x_coeff = 7
y_term = 2 * y
constant = 11

# Solve for x:
x = Fraction(constant - y_term, x_coeff)  # x = (11 - 2y) / 7

# Results:
a = x  # Yield of one bundle of upper millet (上禾)
b = y  # Yield of one bundle of lower millet (下禾)

# Output the results:
a, b

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Translate the equations**: The problem provides two equations based on the yields of upper millet (*上禾*) and lower millet (*下禾*). These are translated into linear equations.
2. **Eliminate one variable**: Using a method similar to Gaussian elimination, the equations are manipulated to eliminate one variable (in this case, *x*).
3. **Solve for the remaining variable**: After eliminating *x*, solve for *y*.
4. **Back-substitute**: Substitute the value of *y* back into one of the original equations to solve for *x*.
5. **Output the results**: The yields of one bundle of upper millet (*a*) and lower millet (*b*) are expressed as fractions.

### Final Answer:
The yield of one bundle of upper millet is `a` dou, and the yield of one bundle of lower millet is `b` dou.
