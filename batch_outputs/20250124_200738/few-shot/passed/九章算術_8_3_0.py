今有上禾五秉，損實一斗一升，當下禾七秉。上禾七秉，損實二斗五升，當下禾五秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾五秉正，下禾七秉負，損實一斗一升正。次置上禾七秉正，下禾五秉負，損實二斗五升正。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉 a升 ，下禾一秉 b升 。

This is a classic simultaneous equations problem from ancient Chinese mathematics, solved using the "fangcheng" (方程) method, which is an early form of solving systems of linear equations. Let's translate the problem and procedure into Python code step by step.

### Problem:
We are given:
1. 5 bundles of upper millet lose 1 dou and 1 sheng of grain, equivalent to 7 bundles of lower millet.
2. 7 bundles of upper millet lose 2 dou and 5 sheng of grain, equivalent to 5 bundles of lower millet.

We are tasked to find how much grain (in sheng) is in one bundle of upper millet and one bundle of lower millet.

### Procedure:
The procedure involves setting up two equations and solving them using the fangcheng method:
1. Represent the problem as a system of linear equations.
2. Use elimination and substitution to solve for the unknowns.

### Conversion:
1 dou = 10 sheng.

### Equations:
Let `x` be the grain in one bundle of upper millet (in sheng), and `y` be the grain in one bundle of lower millet (in sheng).

From the problem:
1. \( 5x - 7y = 11 \) (1 dou 1 sheng = 10 + 1 = 11 sheng)
2. \( 7x - 5y = 25 \) (2 dou 5 sheng = 20 + 5 = 25 sheng)

We solve this system of equations using the fangcheng method.

### Python Code:

"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Coefficients of the equations
# Equation 1: 5x - 7y = 11
a1, b1, c1 = 5, -7, 11

# Equation 2: 7x - 5y = 25
a2, b2, c2 = 7, -5, 25

# Step 1: Eliminate one variable (e.g., y) using the fangcheng method
# Multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 7 to align the coefficients of y
eq1_mult = 5
eq2_mult = 7

a1, b1, c1 = a1 * eq1_mult, b1 * eq1_mult, c1 * eq1_mult
a2, b2, c2 = a2 * eq2_mult, b2 * eq2_mult, c2 * eq2_mult

# Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate y
a = a1 - a2
b = b1 - b2
c = c1 - c2

# Now we have a new equation: ax = c
# Solve for x (grain in one bundle of upper millet)
x = Fraction(c, a)

# Step 2: Substitute x back into one of the original equations to solve for y
# Using the first equation: 5x - 7y = 11
y = Fraction((c1 - a1 * x), b1)

# Convert x and y to sheng
a = x  # Grain in one bundle of upper millet (in sheng)
b = y  # Grain in one bundle of lower millet (in sheng)

# Output the results
a, b
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. The coefficients of the equations are scaled to align the coefficients of one variable (here, `y`).
2. The equations are subtracted to eliminate `y`, leaving an equation in terms of `x`.
3. `x` is solved, and its value is substituted back into one of the original equations to solve for `y`.
4. The results are expressed as fractions to ensure precision.

### Answer:
The grain in one bundle of upper millet is `a` sheng, and the grain in one bundle of lower millet is `b` sheng.
