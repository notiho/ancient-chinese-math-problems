Suppose there is an expenditure of 160 qian to buy 18 bricks.
Question: how much does each brick cost?

The procedure for proportional rates says: Take the number of items bought as the divisor.
Take the amount of money spent as the dividend.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to obtain the cost of one item.

Answer: one brick costs *a* qian.
