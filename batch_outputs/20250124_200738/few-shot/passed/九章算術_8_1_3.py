今有上禾七秉，損實一斗，益之下禾二秉，而實一十斗。下禾八秉，益實一斗與上禾二秉，而實一十斗。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程。損之曰益，益之曰損。損實一斗者，其實過一十斗也。益實一斗者，其實不滿一十斗也。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a斗 ，下禾一秉實 b斗 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using ancient Chinese mathematical methods, which are similar to Gaussian elimination. Let's translate the problem and procedure into Python code step by step.

### Problem:
There are 7 bundles of upper millet (上禾), which lose 1 dou of grain, and when 2 bundles of lower millet (下禾) are added, the total becomes 10 dou.  
There are 8 bundles of lower millet, which gain 1 dou of grain, and when 2 bundles of upper millet are added, the total becomes 10 dou.  
Question: How much grain does one bundle of upper millet and one bundle of lower millet yield?

### Procedure:
The procedure describes solving the system of equations using elimination. The steps are as follows:
1. Represent the problem as a system of equations.
2. Use elimination to solve for the unknowns.

### Equations:
Let `x` be the amount of grain in one bundle of upper millet (上禾), and `y` be the amount of grain in one bundle of lower millet (下禾).  
From the problem, we can derive the following equations:
1. \( 7x - 1 + 2y = 10 \)  
   Simplifies to: \( 7x + 2y = 11 \)
2. \( 8y + 1 + 2x = 10 \)  
   Simplifies to: \( 2x + 8y = 9 \)

We now solve this system of equations.

### Python Code:

"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Coefficients of the equations
# Equation 1: 7x + 2y = 11
a1, b1, c1 = 7, 2, 11

# Equation 2: 2x + 8y = 9
a2, b2, c2 = 2, 8, 9

# Eliminate x by multiplying the equations to align the coefficients of x
# Multiply equation 1 by 2 and equation 2 by 7
a1, b1, c1 = 2 * a1, 2 * b1, 2 * c1  # Now: 14x + 4y = 22
a2, b2, c2 = 7 * a2, 7 * b2, 7 * c2  # Now: 14x + 56y = 63

# Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate x
# (14x + 56y) - (14x + 4y) = 63 - 22
b3 = b2 - b1  # Coefficient of y
c3 = c2 - c1  # Constant term
# Resulting equation: 52y = 41
y = Fraction(c3, b3)  # Solve for y

# Substitute y back into one of the original equations to solve for x
# Using equation 1: 7x + 2y = 11
x = Fraction(c1 - b1 * y, a1)  # Solve for x

# Results
a = x  # Grain per bundle of upper millet
b = y  # Grain per bundle of lower millet

# Output the results
a, b

"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. The two equations are represented with their coefficients.
2. The coefficients are adjusted to align the terms for elimination (multiplying to make the coefficients of `x` equal).
3. Subtraction eliminates `x`, leaving a single equation in terms of `y`.
4. Solve for `y` using the resulting equation.
5. Substitute `y` back into one of the original equations to solve for `x`.
6. The results `a` and `b` represent the grain per bundle of upper millet and lower millet, respectively.

### Final Answer:
The grain per bundle of upper millet is \( a \) dou, and the grain per bundle of lower millet is \( b \) dou.
