The problem as stated is somewhat unclear in its mathematical structure, and the procedure described is ambiguous without additional context or clarification. The text seems to describe a method for calculating the total number of items in a bundle based on some positional manipulation of digits, but the exact meaning of "重置二位左位減八餘加右位" and "至盡虛加一" is not immediately clear.

If you can provide additional clarification or context for the procedure, I would be happy to help translate it into Python code.#----- content ends here -----
