This problem involves dividing a total amount of money (576 coins) among 78 bamboo items, with the goal of determining the price per item for two different categories (e.g., larger and smaller bamboo items). The procedure provided describes how to calculate the rates for each category based on their proportional values.

Let's break this down and implement the solution step by step.

---

### Problem Restatement:
- Total money: 576 coins.
- Total bamboo: 78 items.
- The bamboo is divided into two categories: larger and smaller.
- The procedure involves proportional rates to determine how many items belong to each category and their respective prices.

---

### Procedure Explanation:
1. **Set the proportional rates**: Assign proportional values (e.g., weights) to the two categories.
2. **Calculate the total divisor (法)**: Add the proportional values for the two categories.
3. **Calculate the actual amounts (實)**:
   - Multiply the total money by the proportional value of each category.
4. **Divide by the total divisor**:
   - Divide the result for each category by the total divisor to get the number of items and their respective prices.
5. **Adjust for any remainder**:
   - If there is a remainder, adjust the calculation accordingly.

### Implementation in Python:

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total money and total bamboo
總錢 = 576
總竹 = 78

# Proportional rates for the two categories
大率 = 5  # Rate for larger bamboo
小率 = 3  # Rate for smaller bamboo

# Calculate the total divisor (法)
法 = 大率 + 小率

# Calculate the number of larger bamboo items (實 for larger category)
大箇 = Fraction(總竹 * 大率, 法)

# Calculate the number of smaller bamboo items (實 for smaller category)
小箇 = Fraction(總竹 * 小率, 法)

# Calculate the price per larger bamboo item
大價 = Fraction(總錢 * 大率, 法)

# Calculate the price per smaller bamboo item
小價 = Fraction(總錢 * 小率, 法)

# Final results
a = 大箇
b = Fraction(大價, 大箇)  # Price per larger bamboo item
c = 小箇
d = Fraction(小價, 小箇)  # Price per smaller bamboo item

### Explanation of Variables:
- `a`: Number of larger bamboo items.
- `b`: Price per larger bamboo item.
- `c`: Number of smaller bamboo items.
- `d`: Price per smaller bamboo item.

---

### Example Output:
For the given inputs:
- Total money = 576 coins.
- Total bamboo = 78 items.
- Larger bamboo rate = 5.
- Smaller bamboo rate = 3.

The output will be:
- `a`: Number of larger bamboo items.
- `b`: Price per larger bamboo item.
- `c`: Number of smaller bamboo items.
- `d`: Price per smaller bamboo item.
