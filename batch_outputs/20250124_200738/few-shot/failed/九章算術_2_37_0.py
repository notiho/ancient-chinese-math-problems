This problem involves dividing 576 coins among 78 bamboo pieces, with the goal of determining the price per piece for two different sizes of bamboo. The procedure involves proportional distribution based on the given rates. Let's translate the problem into Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

"""
Suppose there are 576 coins used to buy 78 bamboo pieces. It is desired to determine the proportional rates for the larger and smaller bamboo pieces.
Question: how many of each size, and how much does each cost?

The procedure says: Place the quantities of the larger and smaller bamboo pieces as the divisor.
Multiply the total money by the respective rates to obtain the dividend.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to determine the price per piece.
If the dividend does not match the divisor, adjust by subtracting the difference, with the divisor being cheaper and the dividend being more expensive.

Answer: *a* pieces at *b* coins each, and *c* pieces at *d* coins each.

# Total coins and total bamboo pieces
total_coins = 576
total_bamboo = 78

# Rates for larger and smaller bamboo pieces
larger_rate = 2  # Assume larger bamboo is twice the rate of smaller bamboo
smaller_rate = 1  # Assume smaller bamboo is the base rate

# Total rate (divisor)
total_rate = larger_rate + smaller_rate

# Determine the number of larger and smaller bamboo pieces
larger_pieces = total_bamboo // total_rate * larger_rate
smaller_pieces = total_bamboo - larger_pieces

# Determine the price per piece for larger and smaller bamboo
price_per_larger = (total_coins * larger_rate) // total_rate
price_per_smaller = (total_coins * smaller_rate) // total_rate

# Assign results
a = larger_pieces
b = price_per_larger
c = smaller_pieces
