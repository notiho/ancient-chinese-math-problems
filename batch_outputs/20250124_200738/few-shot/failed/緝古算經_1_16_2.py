假令有句弦相乘冪一千三百三十七二十分之一，弦多股一、十分之一。問：股多少？
術曰：冪自乘，倍多而一，為立冪。又多再自乘，半之，減立冪，余為實。又多數自乘，倍之，為方法。又置多數，五之，二而一，為廉法，從。開立方除之，即股。案：此術脫簡既多，法亦煩擾，宜雲冪自乘，多數而一，所得四之，為實。多為廉法，從。立方開之，得減差，半之，即股。
答曰： a 。

This is a complex ancient Chinese mathematical problem involving the relationship between the hypotenuse (弦), base (股), and height (句) of a right triangle, as well as their squares and cubes. The problem involves solving for the base (股) given the hypotenuse (弦) and the square of the hypotenuse and height (冪). Below is the translation of the procedure into Python code:

Suppose the product of the hypotenuse (弦) and the height (句) is 1337 and 1/20 (i.e., 1337.05).
The hypotenuse exceeds the base (股) by 1 and 1/10 (i.e., 1.1).
Question: how much is the base (股)?

The procedure says:
1. Square the given product (冪), double the excess (多), and add 1 to get the cubic power (立冪).
2. Square the excess (多) again, halve it, and subtract the cubic power (立冪) to get the remainder (實).
3. Multiply the excess (多) by itself, double it, and use it as the divisor (方法).
4. Multiply the excess (多) by 5, divide by 2, and use it as the divisor (廉法).
5. Extract the cube root of the remainder (實), divide by the divisor (廉法), and the result is the base (股).

The procedure is simplified as follows:
1. Square the given product (冪), divide by the excess (多), and divide by 4 to get the remainder (實).
2. Use the excess (多) as the divisor (廉法).
3. Extract the cube root of the remainder (實), subtract the excess (多), halve the result, and the result is the base (股).

Answer: *a*.

### Explanation:
1. **冪自乘，多數而一，所得四之，為實**: The square of the given product (冪) is divided by the excess (多) and then divided by 4 to get the remainder (實).
2. **多為廉法**: The excess (多) is used as the divisor (廉法).
3. **立方開之，得減差，半之，即股**: The cube root of the remainder (實) is extracted, the excess (多) is subtracted, and the result is halved to get the base (股).

This code uses the `Fraction` class to ensure precise calculations for fractional values. The result `a` represents the base (股).
