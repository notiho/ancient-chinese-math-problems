今有出錢五百七十六，買竹七十八箇。欲其大小率之，問︰各幾何？
其率術曰：各置所買石、鈞、斤、兩以為法，以所率乘錢數為實，實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法賤實貴。
荅曰：其 a箇 ，箇 b錢 。其 c箇 ，箇 d錢 。

This problem involves dividing 576 coins among 78 bamboo pieces, with the goal of determining how many are of one type (e.g., large) and how many are of another type (e.g., small), based on their respective rates. However, the problem statement is incomplete and lacks specific details about the rates or proportions for the "大小率" (large and small rates). Without this information, it is impossible to calculate the exact distribution.

If you can provide the specific rates or proportions for the large and small bamboo pieces, I can help translate the procedure into Python code.#----- content ends here -----
