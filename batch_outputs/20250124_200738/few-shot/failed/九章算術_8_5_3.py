今有上禾三秉，益實六斗，當下禾十秉。下禾五秉，益實一斗，當上禾二秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾三秉正，下禾一十秉負，益實六斗負。次置上禾二秉負，下禾五秉正，益實一斗負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a斗 ，下禾一秉實 b斗 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using ancient Chinese methods, specifically the "fangcheng" (方程) method, which is equivalent to solving simultaneous equations. Let's translate the problem into Python code step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given:**
   - 3 bundles of upper millet (上禾) plus 6 dou of grain equals 10 bundles of lower millet (下禾).
   - 5 bundles of lower millet plus 1 dou of grain equals 2 bundles of upper millet.

2. **Goal:**
   - Find the grain (in dou) produced by 1 bundle of upper millet (上禾) and 1 bundle of lower millet (下禾).

3. **Procedure:**
   - Use the fangcheng method (similar to Gaussian elimination) to solve the system of equations.

### Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Step 1: Represent the equations in matrix form
# Equation 1: 3上禾 - 10下禾 - 6 = 0
# Equation 2: -2上禾 + 5下禾 - 1 = 0
matrix = [
    [3, -10, -6],  # Coefficients of 上禾, 下禾, and constant term for Equation 1
    [-2, 5, -1]    # Coefficients of 上禾, 下禾, and constant term for Equation 2
]

# Step 2: Eliminate 上禾 from the second equation
# Multiply the first row by 2 and the second row by 3 to align 上禾 coefficients
row1 = [2 * x for x in matrix[0]]  # [6, -20, -12]
row2 = [3 * x for x in matrix[1]]  # [-6, 15, -3]

# Add the two rows to eliminate 上禾
row2 = [row2[i] + row1[i] for i in range(3)]  # [0, -5, -15]

# Step 3: Solve for 下禾 (row2 now represents -5下禾 = -15)
下禾 = Fraction(-row2[2], row2[1])  # 下禾 = 3斗

# Step 4: Substitute 下禾 back into the first equation to solve for 上禾
# 3上禾 - 10下禾 - 6 = 0
# 3上禾 - 10(3) - 6 = 0
# 3上禾 - 30 - 6 = 0
# 3上禾 = 36
上禾 = Fraction(36, 3)  # 上禾 = 12斗

# Step 5: Output the results
a = 上禾  # 上禾一秉實
b = 下禾  # 下禾一秉實

# Final Answer
print(f"上禾一秉實 {a}斗 ，下禾一秉實 {b}斗 。")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Matrix Representation:**
   - The two equations are represented as rows in a matrix, where each row contains the coefficients of 上禾, 下禾, and the constant term.

2. **Elimination:**
   - The coefficients of 上禾 are aligned by multiplying the rows by appropriate factors. Then, the rows are added to eliminate 上禾, leaving an equation with only 下禾.

3. **Back Substitution:**
   - The value of 下禾 is substituted back into one of the original equations to solve for 上禾.

4. **Result:**
   - The grain produced by 1 bundle of upper millet (上禾) and 1 bundle of lower millet (下禾) is calculated and printed.

### Final Answer:
```
上禾一秉實 12斗 ，下禾一秉實 3斗 。
```
