今有漆三得油四，油四和漆五。今有漆三斗，欲令分以易油，還自和餘漆。問︰出漆、得油、和漆各幾何？
術曰：假令出漆九升，不足六升。令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰：出漆 a斗 ，得油 b斗 ，和漆 c斗 ， d升 。

This is a complex problem involving proportional exchange and reconciliation of surpluses and deficits. Let's break it down step by step and encode the solution in Python.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Ratios**:
   - 3 dou of lacquer (漆) can produce 4 dou of oil (油).
   - 4 dou of oil can mix with 5 dou of lacquer.

2. **Task**:
   - Start with 3 dou of lacquer.
   - Exchange lacquer for oil.
   - Reconcile the remaining lacquer with the oil to form a mixture.
   - Determine:
     - How much lacquer is exchanged (出漆).
     - How much oil is obtained (得油).
     - How much lacquer remains and is mixed with the oil (和漆).

3. **Procedure**:
   - Use the "盈不足術" (Surplus and Deficit Method) to calculate the exchange and reconciliation.

### Python Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# 漆三得油四 (3 dou of lacquer produces 4 dou of oil)
漆_to_油_ratio = Fraction(4, 3)

# 油四和漆五 (4 dou of oil mixes with 5 dou of lacquer)
油_to_漆_ratio = Fraction(5, 4)

# 今有漆三斗 (Start with 3 dou of lacquer)
initial_漆 = 3

# Step 1: Calculate how much lacquer is exchanged (出漆)
# 假令出漆九升，不足六升 (Assume 9 sheng exchanged, deficit 6 sheng)
# 漆 is exchanged in dou, so convert 9 sheng to dou: 9 sheng = 0.9 dou
假出漆 = Fraction(9, 10)  # 0.9 dou
不足 = Fraction(6, 10)   # 0.6 dou

# 盈不足術: Calculate the actual amount of lacquer exchanged
# 盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下
所出率 = 漆_to_油_ratio  # 4/3
盈 = 所出率.numerator     # 4 (numerator of 4/3)
不足 = 所出率.denominator - 盈  # 3 - 4 = -1 (deficit)

# 令維乘所出率，并以為實
實 = 假出漆 * 所出率

# 并盈、不足為法
法 = 盈 + 不足

# 實如法而一
出漆 = 實 / 法

# Step 2: Calculate how much oil is obtained (得油)
得油 = 出漆 * 漆_to_油_ratio

# Step 3: Calculate remaining lacquer and mix it with the obtained oil
remaining_漆 = initial_漆 - 出漆
和漆 = remaining_漆 + 得油 * 油_to_漆_ratio

# Convert 和漆 to dou and sheng
和漆_dou = 和漆.numerator // 和漆.denominator  # Integer part (dou)
和漆_sheng = 和漆.numerator % 和漆.denominator  # Remainder (sheng)

# Final Results
a = 出漆  # 出漆 (lacquer exchanged)
b = 得油  # 得油 (oil obtained)
c = 和漆_dou  # 和漆 (mixed lacquer in dou)
d = 和漆_sheng  # 和漆 (remaining lacquer in sheng)

# Output results
a, b, c, d

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Ratios**:
   - `漆_to_油_ratio` represents the ratio of lacquer to oil (4/3).
   - `油_to_漆_ratio` represents the ratio of oil to lacquer for mixing (5/4).

2. **盈不足術**:
   - The surplus and deficit method is used to calculate the actual amount of lacquer exchanged (`出漆`).

3. **Remaining Lacquer**:
   - After exchanging lacquer for oil, the remaining lacquer is mixed with the obtained oil to form a mixture.

4. **Output**:
   - `a`: Amount of lacquer exchanged (in dou).
   - `b`: Amount of oil obtained (in dou).
   - `c`: Amount of lacquer mixed (in dou).
   - `d`: Remaining lacquer (in sheng).
