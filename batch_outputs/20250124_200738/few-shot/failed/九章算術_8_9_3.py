今有甲乙二人持錢不知其數。甲得乙半而錢五十，乙得甲太半而亦錢五十。問︰甲、乙持錢各幾何？
術曰：如方程，損益之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：甲持 a錢 ，乙持 b錢 。

This problem involves solving a system of equations to determine how much money person A (甲) and person B (乙) each have. The problem is described in terms of a traditional Chinese mathematical method, but we can translate it into a modern algebraic approach using Python.

The problem states:
- If A takes half of B's money, A will have 50 units of money.
- If B takes more than half of A's money (specifically, 3/2 of half of A's money), B will also have 50 units of money.

We will solve this system of equations using Python:

### Equations:
1. \( A + \frac{1}{2}B = 50 \)
2. \( B + \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}A = 50 \)

### Solution in Python:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the equations
# A + (1/2)B = 50
# B + (3/2)(1/2)A = 50

# Let us represent the coefficients and constants
# Equation 1: A + (1/2)B = 50
coeff_A1 = 1
coeff_B1 = Fraction(1, 2)
const1 = 50

# Equation 2: B + (3/2)(1/2)A = 50
coeff_A2 = Fraction(3, 4)  # (3/2)(1/2) = 3/4
coeff_B2 = 1
const2 = 50

# Solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination
# Multiply the first equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction for B
coeff_A1 *= 2
coeff_B1 *= 2
const1 *= 2

# New Equation 1: 2A + B = 100
# Equation 2 remains: (3/4)A + B = 50

# Eliminate B by subtracting the second equation from the first
coeff_A_combined = coeff_A1 - coeff_A2
coeff_B_combined = coeff_B1 - coeff_B2
const_combined = const1 - const2

# Solve for A
A = Fraction(const_combined, coeff_A_combined)

# Substitute A back into one of the original equations to solve for B
B = Fraction(const1 - coeff_A1 * A, coeff_B1)

# Results
a = A
b = B

print(f"甲持 {a} 錢，乙持 {b} 錢。")

"""


### Explanation:
1. We first rewrite the equations to eliminate fractions where possible.
2. Using substitution or elimination, we solve for one variable (A) and then substitute it back to find the other variable (B).
3. The solution is expressed using the `Fraction` class to ensure exact results.

### Answer:
甲持 \( a \) 錢，乙持 \( b \) 錢。
