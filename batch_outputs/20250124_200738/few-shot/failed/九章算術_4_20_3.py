今有積六萬三千四百一尺、五百一十二分尺之四百四十七。問︰為立方幾何？
開立方術曰：置積為實。借一算步之，超二等。議所得，以再乘所借一算為法，而除之。除已，三之為定法。復除，折而下。以三乘所得數置中行。復借一算置下行。步之，中超一，下超二等。復置議，以一乘中，再乘下，皆副以加定法。以定法除。除已，倍下、并中從定法。復除，折下如前。開之不盡者，亦為不可開。若積有分者，通分內子為定實。定實乃開之，訖，開其母以報除。若母不可開者，又以母再乘定實，乃開之。訖，令如母而一。
荅曰： a尺 。

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: The given volume is represented as a fraction to handle both the integer and fractional parts.
2. **Cube Root Extraction**:
   - First, the integer part of the cube root is determined by iteratively checking which cube is less than or equal to the given volume.
   - Then, the remainder is used to refine the result by considering fractional parts.
3. **Fraction Handling**: The remainder is multiplied by a large number (e.g., 1000) to handle fractional precision, and the process is repeated for further refinement.
4. **Output**: The result is the cube root of the given volume, expressed as a fraction.

This implementation follows the ancient procedure described in the problem. The result `a` is the cube root in chi (尺).
