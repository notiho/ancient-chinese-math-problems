This is a complex ancient Chinese mathematical problem involving cubic equations and geometric relationships. Let's break it down step by step and translate the procedure into Python code.

### Problem Description:
- There are 3072 shi of millet.
- A square granary and a circular pit are to be constructed.
- The diameter of the circular pit is equal to the side length of the square granary.
- The square granary is 2 chi deeper than the circular pit.
- The square granary is 3 chi shorter than the height of the circular pit.
- Both the granary and the pit are filled completely with millet, and the millet is exactly used up.
- We are tasked with finding the side length of the square granary (`方`), the diameter of the circular pit (`徑`), the height of the square granary (`高`), and the depth of the circular pit (`深`).

### Procedure:
The procedure involves solving a cubic equation derived from the volume relationships of the granary and the pit. The steps are as follows:
1. Compute an initial rate based on the millet volume.
2. Use the relationships between the granary and pit dimensions to construct a cubic equation.
3. Solve the cubic equation to find the depth of the circular pit.
4. Use the depth to compute the other dimensions.

### Python Code:

### Explanation of Variables:
- `率`: The initial rate derived from the millet volume.
- `差深`: The difference in depth between the granary and the pit.
- `差高`: The difference in height between the granary and the pit.
- `多`: A placeholder variable used in the cubic equation.
- `實`: The "remainder" after subtracting part of the cubic equation from the rate.
- `方法`: A term in the cubic equation.
- `廉法`: Another term in the cubic equation.
- `深`: The depth of the circular pit, solved from the cubic equation.
- `方`: The side length of the square granary.
- `徑`: The diameter of the circular pit (equal to `方`).
- `高`: The height of the square granary.

### Note:
The variable `多` is a placeholder for solving the cubic equation. In practice, solving this equation requires numerical methods or iterative approximation, as it is not straightforward to solve cubic equations algebraically in general cases.
