Suppose there is a dike with a bottom width of 2 zhang, a top width of 8 chi, a height of 4 chi, and a length of 12 zhang 7 chi.
Question: what is the volume of the dike?

Answer: 7112 chi³.

Additionally, if one worker can handle 444 chi³ of work, how many workers are required?

The procedure says: Take the volume in chi³ as the dividend, and the worker's capacity in chi³ as the divisor.
Divide the dividend by the divisor, obtaining the number of workers required.

Answer: *a* workers.
