今有甲禾二秉、乙禾三秉、丙禾四秉，重皆過於石。甲二重如乙一，乙三重如丙一，丙四重如甲一。問︰甲、乙、丙禾一秉各重幾何？
術曰：如方程，置重過於石之物為負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：甲禾一秉重 a石 ，乙禾一秉重 b石 ，丙禾一秉重 c石 。

This problem involves solving a system of equations using ancient Chinese "fangcheng" (方程) methods, which is equivalent to solving linear equations. Let's translate the problem into Python step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
- There are three types of grain: A (甲禾), B (乙禾), and C (丙禾).
- The weights of the grains are related as follows:
  - 2 weights of A equal 1 weight of B.
  - 3 weights of B equal 1 weight of C.
  - 4 weights of C equal 1 weight of A.
- The total weight of the grains is given:
  - A has 2 bundles, B has 3 bundles, and C has 4 bundles, and their combined weight exceeds 1 shi (石).

We need to find the weight of one bundle of A, B, and C.

---

### Procedure:
The procedure uses the "fangcheng" method (similar to Gaussian elimination). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Set up the equations**:
   - Let `a` be the weight of one bundle of A, `b` be the weight of one bundle of B, and `c` be the weight of one bundle of C.
   - From the problem:
     - \( 2a = b \) (Equation 1)
     - \( 3b = c \) (Equation 2)
     - \( 4c = a \) (Equation 3)
   - Additionally, the total weight is:
     - \( 2a + 3b + 4c = 39 \) dou (斗).

2. **Express all variables in terms of one variable**:
   - From Equation 1: \( b = 2a \).
   - From Equation 2: \( c = 3b = 3(2a) = 6a \).
   - Substitute \( b \) and \( c \) into the total weight equation:
     - \( 2a + 3(2a) + 4(6a) = 39 \).
     - \( 2a + 6a + 24a = 39 \).
     - \( 32a = 39 \).
     - \( a = \frac{39}{32} \).

3. **Solve for `b` and `c`**:
   - \( b = 2a = 2 \times \frac{39}{32} = \frac{78}{32} = \frac{39}{16} \).
   - \( c = 6a = 6 \times \frac{39}{32} = \frac{234}{32} = \frac{117}{16} \).

4. **Convert to shi (石)**:
   - Since 1 shi = 10 dou, divide each result by 10:
     - \( a = \frac{39}{320} \) shi.
     - \( b = \frac{39}{160} \) shi.
     - \( c = \frac{117}{160} \) shi.

### Final Answer:
- \( a = \frac{39}{320} \) shi.
- \( b = \frac{39}{160} \) shi.
- \( c = \frac{117}{160} \) shi.
