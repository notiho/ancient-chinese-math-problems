This is a complex ancient Chinese mathematical problem involving the calculation of dimensions for a square granary and a circular pit based on a given volume of grain. Let's translate the procedure into Python step by step.

### Problem Explanation:
- There is a total of 16,348 shi and 8 dou of grain.
- A square granary (方倉) and a circular pit (圓窖) are to be constructed, with the height (or depth) being equal for both.
- The side of the square granary is 1 zhang less than the diameter of the circular pit, and 5 chi more than the height.
- The volume of the grain is to be distributed between the square granary and the circular pit.
- The procedure involves using the given relationships and the ancient approximation for π (22/7) to calculate the dimensions.

### Procedure:
1. **Convert the grain volume into cubic chi**:
   - 1 shi = 10 dou.
   - 1 dou = \(2.5^3\) cubic chi (斛法二尺五寸).
   - Multiply the total grain volume by \(2.5^3\) to get the volume in cubic chi.

2. **Calculate the "實" (volume factor)**:
   - Multiply the grain volume by 14 and divide by 89.

3. **Calculate the "方法" (square granary side factor)**:
   - Use the relationships between the square granary side, the circular pit diameter, and the height to calculate the side of the square granary.

4. **Calculate the "廉法" (circular pit diameter factor)**:
   - Use the relationships to calculate the diameter of the circular pit.

5. **Solve for height and dimensions**:
   - Solve the cubic equation to find the height (or depth).
   - Use the height to calculate the side of the square granary and the diameter of the circular pit.

Let's translate this into Python:

# 開立方除之，即高、深
高深 = pow(實 / 方法, Fraction(1, 3))

# 各加差，即方徑
方 = 高深 + 少
圓徑 = 高深 + 多

# Output results
a = 方 / 10  # Convert to zhang
b = 高深 / 10  # Convert to zhang
c = 圓徑 / 10  # Convert to zhang

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Volume Conversion**:
   - The total grain volume is converted from shi and dou into cubic chi using the given "斛法" (2.5 chi).

2. **實 Calculation**:
   - The volume factor "實" is calculated by multiplying the grain volume by 14 and dividing by 89.

3. **方法 and 廉法**:
   - These are calculated using the relationships between the square granary side, the circular pit diameter, and the height.

4. **Height and Dimensions**:
   - The cubic equation is solved to find the height (or depth), and the dimensions of the square granary and circular pit are calculated accordingly.

### Final Output:
The program will output the side of the square granary (方), the height/depth (高深), and the diameter of the circular pit (圓徑) in zhang.
