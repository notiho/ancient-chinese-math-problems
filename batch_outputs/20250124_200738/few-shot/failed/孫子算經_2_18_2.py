This problem describes a method for extracting the square root of a number using an ancient Chinese algorithm. The goal is to find the side length of a square given its area (積). Let's translate this into Python code step by step.

Suppose there is an area of 234567 bu.
Question: what is the side length of the square?

The procedure says:
1. Place the area (234567 bu) as the dividend.
2. Borrow one digit as the divisor, shifting the digits until the hundreds place.
3. Place the first quotient (400) above the dividend, and place the square of the quotient (400^2 = 160000) below the dividend.
4. Subtract to get the remainder.
5. Double the current side length (400) to form the new divisor, and shift it one place to the left.
6. Place the next quotient (80) above the dividend, and place the product (80 * 800 = 64000) below the remainder.
7. Subtract to get the new remainder.
8. Repeat the process for the next digit (4), forming the final side length.

The answer says: the side length is *a* bu.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **商1 (First Quotient):** The first approximation of the square root is 400. Its square (400^2 = 160000) is subtracted from the area to get the first remainder.
2. **方法1 (First Divisor):** The current side length (400) is doubled to form the new divisor (800).
3. **商2 (Second Quotient):** The next approximation is 80. Its product with the divisor (80 * 800 = 64000) is subtracted from the remainder.
4. **方法2 (Second Divisor):** The updated side length (400 + 80) is doubled to form the new divisor (960).
5. **商3 (Third Quotient):** The next approximation is 4. Its product with the divisor (4 * 960 = 3840) is subtracted from the remainder.
6. **Fractional Part:** The remainder is divided by the final divisor to get the fractional part of the side length.

### Final Answer:
The side length of the square is `a` bu, which includes both the integer and fractional parts.
