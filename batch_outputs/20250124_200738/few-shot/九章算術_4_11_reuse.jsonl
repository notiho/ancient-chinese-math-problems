Otherwise, the method would indicate that the square root cannot be extracted exactly.\n5. **Output**: The result is the side length of the square field (`a`).\n\n### Answer:\nFor the given problem, the side length of the square field is `a = 235` bu.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1985, "completion_tokens": 3186, "total_tokens": 5171, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_60a3f2dc65"}}, "error": null}
