This problem involves solving a system of linear equations to determine the value of each type of silk (upper, middle, and lower) in terms of plain silk. The ancient Chinese method described here is equivalent to solving a system of equations using elimination, similar to Gaussian elimination.

The problem can be represented as:

1. \( 3x + 2y + z = 45 \)
2. \( 2x + 3y + z = 43 \)
3. \( x + 2y + 3z = 35 \)

Where:
- \( x \) is the value of one unit of upper silk in terms of plain silk.
- \( y \) is the value of one unit of middle silk in terms of plain silk.
- \( z \) is the value of one unit of lower silk in terms of plain silk.

We will solve this system step by step using the described procedure.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Step 1:** The coefficients of the equations are defined based on the problem.
2. **Step 2:** The first equation is used to eliminate \( x \) from the second and third equations.
3. **Step 3:** The new second equation is used to eliminate \( y \) from the third equation.
4. **Step 4:** The third equation is now a single-variable equation, which is solved for \( z \).
5. **Step 5:** The value of \( z \) is substituted back into the second equation to solve for \( y \).
6. **Step 6:** The values of \( y \) and \( z \) are substituted back into the first equation to solve for \( x \).

### Final Answer:
The values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) represent the number of plain silk units corresponding to one unit of upper, middle, and lower silk, respectively.
