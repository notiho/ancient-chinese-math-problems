Suppose there is one sparrow weighing 1 liang and 9 zhu, and one swallow weighing 1 liang and 5 zhu.
There are 25 sparrows and swallows in total, and their combined weight is 2 jin and 13 zhu.
Question: how many sparrows and swallows are there respectively?

The procedure says: 
1. Assume sparrows are 15 and swallows are 10. This results in an excess of 4 zhu, recorded on the right side.
2. Assume sparrows are 12 and swallows are 13. This results in a deficit of 8 zhu, recorded on the left side.
3. Multiply the excess and deficit, and combine them to form the dividend.
4. Add the excess and deficit to form the divisor.
5. Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the adjustment for one type.
6. Use this adjustment to calculate the number of sparrows and swallows.

Answer: *a* sparrows, *b* swallows.
