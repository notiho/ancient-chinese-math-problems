Suppose there are 3463 bolts of silk, each bolt measuring 1 zhang, 3 chi, and 4 cun. 
Each bolt is worth 3 guan and 500 wen.
Question: what is the total amount of money?

The procedure says: First, place the number of bolts of silk. 
For zhang, chi, and below, convert them into halves and fives. 
Then multiply by 5 and 7, and the result is obtained.

Answer: *a* guan.
