This problem involves determining the number of people based on the number of cups used for different shared items (sauce, soup, and rice). Let's translate the procedure into Python code step by step.

"""
Suppose there is a woman by the river washing cups. The ferry officer asks: "Why are there so many cups, woman?"

The procedure says: Place the total number of cups and the number of people sharing them in a table. 
For each shared item (sauce, soup, rice), multiply the number of people sharing by the number of cups for that item. 
Sum these products to form the divisor (法). 
Multiply the total number of cups by the product of the number of people sharing for all items to form the dividend (實). 
Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the total number of people.

Answer: There are *e* people in total.

共羮人數 = 3  # Number of people sharing soup

# Procedure
# Multiply the number of people sharing by the number of cups for each item
醬實 = 共醬人數 * 共醬杯數
羮實 = 共羮人數 * 共羮杯數
飯實 = 共飯人數 * 共飯杯數

# Sum these products to form the divisor (法)

# Multiply the total number of cups by the product of the number of people sharing for all items to form the dividend (實)
總杯數 = 共醬杯數 + 共羮杯數 + 共飯杯數
總人數乘積 = 共醬人數 * 共羮人數 * 共飯人數
實 = 總杯數 * 総人數乘積

# Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the total number of people
e = Fraction(實, 法)

# Outputs
a = 共醬人數
b = 共羮人數
c = 共飯人數
