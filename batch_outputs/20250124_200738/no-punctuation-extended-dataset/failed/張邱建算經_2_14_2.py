Suppose there are three women, each embroidering one square piece of fabric.
The eldest finishes in 7 days, the middle one in 8 and a half days, and the youngest in 9 and a half days.
Now, let the three women work together to embroider one square piece of fabric.
Question: how many days will it take for them to finish?

The procedure says: Place the number of days [for each woman].
Multiply [each woman's rate] by the total square piece of fabric, summing them up to form the divisor.
Multiply the number of days by each other to form the dividend.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the result.

Answer: it takes *a* days.
