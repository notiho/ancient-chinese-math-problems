Suppose there is a tax rate of 3 bolts of silk per household. Based on wealth, it is desired to distribute the tax across nine classes of households, with each class differing by 2 zhang (units of silk). 
The distribution is as follows:
- Shangshang (Upper-Upper): 39 households
- Shangzhong (Upper-Middle): 24 households
- Shangxia (Upper-Lower): 57 households
- Zhongshang (Middle-Upper): 31 households
- Zhongzhong (Middle-Middle): 78 households
- Zhongxia (Middle-Lower): 43 households
- Xiashang (Lower-Upper): 25 households
- Xiazhong (Lower-Middle): 76 households
- Xiaxia (Lower-Lower): 13 households

Question: How much silk should each household in the nine classes contribute?

The procedure says:
1. Assign the weights for each class:
   - Shangshang households: 16
   - Shangzhong households: 14
   - Shangxia households: 12
   - Zhongshang households: 10
   - Zhongzhong households: 8
   - Zhongxia households: 6
   - Xiashang households: 4
   - Xiazhong households: 2
   - Xiaxia households: 0
2. Multiply the number of households in each class by their respective weights, and sum these to get the total weighted contribution.
3. Multiply the total number of households by the tax rate (3 bolts of silk) to get the total amount of silk required.
4. Divide the total silk required by the total weighted contribution to get the base unit of silk per weight.
5. Multiply the base unit by the weight of each class to determine the silk contribution per household in each class.

Answer: 
- Shangshang households contribute *a* bolts of silk each.
- Shangzhong households contribute *b* bolts of silk each.
- Shangxia households contribute *c* bolts of silk each.
- Zhongshang households contribute *d* bolts of silk each.
- Zhongzhong households contribute *e* bolts of silk each.
- Zhongxia households contribute *f* bolts of silk each.
- Xiashang households contribute *g* bolts of silk each.
- Xiazhong households contribute *h* bolts of silk each.
- Xiaxia households contribute *i* bolts of silk each.
