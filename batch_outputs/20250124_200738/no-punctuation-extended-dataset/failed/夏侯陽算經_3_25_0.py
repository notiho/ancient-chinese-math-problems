Suppose there are 13,467 liang of silk.
Question: how many jin does it make?

The procedure says: Place the number of liang of silk.
Divide it by 4 and a half (i.e., 4.5), which gives the number of jin.
If there is a remainder of 6, add it to the result to finalize the calculation.

Answer: it makes *a* jin.

# 絲一萬三千四百六十七兩
絲兩數 = 13467

# 四折半，即是斤
斤 = Fraction(絲兩數, 9 / 2)

# 逢零六添之歸實 (This step is ambiguous in the text, but traditionally, it might mean rounding or adjusting based on specific rules. 
# Since no remainder operation is explicitly defined, we'll leave this step as is.)

a = 斤#----- content ends here -----
