Suppose there are two people working for three days, smelting copper, and they produce 1 jin, 9 liang, and 5 zhu.
Now, in one month and three days (33 days), the smelted copper weighs 9876 jin, 5 liang, and 4 zhu, minus half a zhu.
Question: how many people worked?

The procedure says:
1. Place the amount of copper smelted by two people in three days (in jin, liang, and zhu), convert it all to zhu, and divide it by the product of two people and three days. This gives the amount smelted by one person in one day in zhu.
2. Convert this amount back to liang and zhu for clarity.
3. Multiply the one-person-one-day amount by the total number of days (33 days) to get the total smelted by one person in 33 days, in zhu.
4. Convert the total smelted copper (9876 jin, 5 liang, 4 zhu minus half a zhu) into zhu. Subtract the half zhu (1/2 zhu) from the total.
5. Divide the total smelted copper (in zhu) by the total smelted by one person in 33 days (in zhu). Simplify the result to get the number of people.

Answer: *a* people.
