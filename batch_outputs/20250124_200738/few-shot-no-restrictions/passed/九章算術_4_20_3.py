今有積六萬三千四百一尺、五百一十二分尺之四百四十七。問︰為立方幾何？
開立方術曰：置積為實。借一算步之，超二等。議所得，以再乘所借一算為法，而除之。除已，三之為定法。復除，折而下。以三乘所得數置中行。復借一算置下行。步之，中超一，下超二等。復置議，以一乘中，再乘下，皆副以加定法。以定法除。除已，倍下、并中從定法。復除，折下如前。開之不盡者，亦為不可開。若積有分者，通分內子為定實。定實乃開之，訖，開其母以報除。若母不可開者，又以母再乘定實，乃開之。訖，令如母而一。
荅曰： a尺 。

This is a classic ancient Chinese problem involving the extraction of a cube root. The problem is asking to find the cube root of a given volume, expressed in a complex fractional form. The procedure described is the method for extracting cube roots, which involves iterative approximation and division.

Let's translate this into Python code step by step:

---

### Problem Breakdown:
- The given volume is \( 63401 \frac{447}{512} \) cubic chi.
- We are tasked with finding the cube root of this volume, expressed in chi.

---

### Procedure:
1. **Convert the fractional volume into a single fraction**:
   Combine the integer part and the fractional part into a single fraction.

2. **Iterative Cube Root Extraction**:
   Use the described method to extract the cube root. This involves:
   - Placing the volume as the "dividend."
   - Iteratively approximating the cube root by dividing and refining the estimate.

3. **Handle Fractions**:
   If the volume has a fractional part, ensure the cube root is calculated accurately by handling the numerator and denominator separately.

---

### Python Code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Step 1: Define the given volume as a fraction
integer_part = 63401
fractional_part = Fraction(447, 512)
volume = integer_part + fractional_part  # Combine into a single fraction

# Step 2: Define a function to extract the cube root using approximation
def cube_root_fraction(volume, precision=10):
    # Start with an initial guess for the cube root
    guess = volume ** Fraction(1, 3)  # Initial approximation using fractional exponent
    for _ in range(precision):
        # Refine the guess using the cube root formula
        guess = (2 * guess + volume / (guess ** 2)) / 3
    return guess

# Step 3: Calculate the cube root
cube_root = cube_root_fraction(volume)

# Step 4: Output the result
a = cube_root
print(f"The cube root of the given volume is approximately: {a} chi.")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Volume Representation**:
   The volume \( 63401 \frac{447}{512} \) is represented as a `Fraction` object to ensure precise calculations.

2. **Cube Root Approximation**:
   The function `cube_root_fraction` uses an iterative method (similar to Newton's method) to approximate the cube root of the given volume.

3. **Precision**:
   The `precision` parameter controls the number of iterations for refining the cube root. More iterations yield a more accurate result.

4. **Output**:
   The result is expressed as a fraction for exactness.

---

### Example Output:
If you run the code, it will compute the cube root of the given volume and output the result in chi.
