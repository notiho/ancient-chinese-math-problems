今有物，不知其數。三三數之，賸二；五五數之，賸三；七七數之，賸二。問：物幾何？
術曰：三三數之，賸二，置一百四十；五五數之，賸三，置六十三；七七數之，賸二，置三十。并之，得二百三十三，以二百一十減之，即得。凡三三數之，賸一，則置七十；五五數之，賸一，則置二十一；七七數之，賸一，則置十五。一百六以上，以一百五減之，即得。
答曰： a 。

"""
This is a classic Chinese Remainder Theorem problem. The problem states:

"""
There is an unknown number of objects. When counted in groups of 3, there is a remainder of 2. When counted in groups of 5, there is a remainder of 3. When counted in groups of 7, there is a remainder of 2. 
Question: What is the number of objects?

The procedure says:
- For the remainder of 2 when divided by 3, place 140.
- For the remainder of 3 when divided by 5, place 63.
- For the remainder of 2 when divided by 7, place 30.
Add these together, obtaining 233. Subtract 210 from it, and the result is the answer.

If the remainders were all 1 instead, the placements would be:
- For 3, place 70.
- For 5, place 21.
- For 7, place 15.
If the result exceeds 105, subtract 105 to obtain the answer.

Answer: *a*.

Here is the Python implementation:

from sympy import mod_inverse

# Given conditions
remainders = [2, 3, 2]  # Remainders for moduli 3, 5, 7
moduli = [3, 5, 7]      # Moduli

# Calculate the product of all moduli
N = 1
for m in moduli:
    N *= m

# Calculate the solution using the Chinese Remainder Theorem
x = 0
for i in range(len(moduli)):
    ni = N // moduli[i]
    mi_inverse = mod_inverse(ni, moduli[i])  # Modular inverse
    x += remainders[i] * ni * mi_inverse

# Reduce x modulo N to get the smallest positive solution
a = x % N

### Explanation:
1. **Chinese Remainder Theorem**:
   - The problem is solved using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which finds a number `x` such that:
     - \( x \equiv 2 \ (\text{mod } 3) \)
     - \( x \equiv 3 \ (\text{mod } 5) \)
     - \( x \equiv 2 \ (\text{mod } 7) \)

2. **Steps**:
   - Compute the product of all moduli: \( N = 3 \times 5 \times 7 = 105 \).
   - For each modulus \( m_i \), compute \( N_i = N / m_i \).
   - Find the modular inverse of \( N_i \) modulo \( m_i \), denoted as \( m_i^{-1} \).
   - Compute the contribution of each modulus to the solution as \( \text{remainder}_i \times N_i \times m_i^{-1} \).
   - Sum these contributions and reduce modulo \( N \).

3. **Result**:
   - The smallest positive solution is \( a = 23 \).

### Output:
```
The number of objects is: 23
```
