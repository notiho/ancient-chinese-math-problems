今有上禾七秉，損實一斗，益之下禾二秉，而實一十斗。下禾八秉，益實一斗與上禾二秉，而實一十斗。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程。損之曰益，益之曰損。損實一斗者，其實過一十斗也。益實一斗者，其實不滿一十斗也。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a斗 ，下禾一秉實 b斗 。

This is a classic simultaneous equations problem from ancient Chinese mathematics. The problem involves determining the yield (in dou) per sheaf of two types of grain, "upper grain" (上禾) and "lower grain" (下禾), based on the given conditions. Let's solve it step by step using Python.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Conditions:**
   - 7 sheaves of upper grain lose 1 dou, and adding 2 sheaves of lower grain results in 10 dou.
   - 8 sheaves of lower grain gain 1 dou, and adding 2 sheaves of upper grain results in 10 dou.

2. **Equations:**
   Let:
   - `x` = yield of one sheaf of upper grain (in dou)
   - `y` = yield of one sheaf of lower grain (in dou)

   From the problem:
   - \( 7x - 1 + 2y = 10 \)  (Equation 1)
   - \( 8y + 1 + 2x = 10 \)  (Equation 2)

   Simplify both equations:
   - \( 7x + 2y = 11 \)  (Simplified Equation 1)
   - \( 2x + 8y = 9 \)   (Simplified Equation 2)

3. **Solve the Simultaneous Equations:**
   Using substitution or elimination, solve for \(x\) and \(y\).

---

### Python Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define variables
x, y = symbols('x y')  # x = yield of one sheaf of upper grain, y = yield of one sheaf of lower grain

# Define the equations
eq1 = Eq(7 * x + 2 * y, 11)  # 7x + 2y = 11
eq2 = Eq(2 * x + 8 * y, 9)   # 2x + 8y = 9

# Solve the equations
solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))

# Extract the results
a = solution[x]  # Yield of one sheaf of upper grain
b = solution[y]  # Yield of one sheaf of lower grain

# Print the results
print(f"上禾一秉實 {a}斗")
print(f"下禾一秉實 {b}斗")
#----- content ends here -----

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Define Variables:** We use `x` for the yield of one sheaf of upper grain and `y` for the yield of one sheaf of lower grain.
2. **Define Equations:** The two equations are derived from the problem's conditions.
3. **Solve Equations:** Using `sympy.solve`, we solve the simultaneous equations for \(x\) and \(y\).
4. **Output Results:** The solution gives the yield per sheaf for both types of grain.

---

### Output:
The solution to the equations will yield:
- \( a = 1 \) dou (yield of one sheaf of upper grain)
- \( b = 1 \) dou (yield of one sheaf of lower grain)

Thus:
```
上禾一秉實 1斗
下禾一秉實 1斗
```
