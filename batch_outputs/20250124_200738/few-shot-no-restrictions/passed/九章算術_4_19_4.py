今有積一千九百五十三尺、八分尺之一。問︰為立方幾何？
開立方術曰：置積為實。借一算步之，超二等。議所得，以再乘所借一算為法，而除之。除已，三之為定法。復除，折而下。以三乘所得數置中行。復借一算置下行。步之，中超一，下超二等。復置議，以一乘中，再乘下，皆副以加定法。以定法除。除已，倍下、并中從定法。復除，折下如前。開之不盡者，亦為不可開。若積有分者，通分內子為定實。定實乃開之，訖，開其母以報除。若母不可開者，又以母再乘定實，乃開之。訖，令如母而一。
荅曰： a尺 。

This is a classic ancient Chinese problem involving the extraction of a cube root, specifically for a number with fractional parts. The problem asks to find the cube root of \(1953 \frac{1}{8}\) chi. Below is the Python implementation of the procedure described in the problem:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given volume
積 = 1953 + Fraction(1, 8)

# Step 1: Convert the fractional part into a single fraction (通分)
積 = Fraction(積)

# Step 2: Define a function to calculate the cube root using an iterative approximation method
def cube_root(volume, precision=10):
    # Start with an initial guess
    guess = volume ** Fraction(1, 3)
    for _ in range(precision):
        # Newton's method for cube root
        guess = (2 * guess + volume / (guess ** 2)) / 3
    return guess

# Step 3: Compute the cube root
a = cube_root(積)

# Output the result
print(f"The cube root of the given volume is approximately {a} chi.")
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Conversion**: The given volume \(1953 \frac{1}{8}\) is converted into a single fraction using Python's `Fraction` class for precise arithmetic.
2. **Cube Root Calculation**: The cube root is calculated using an iterative approximation method (Newton's method), which is a modern approach to solving such problems efficiently.
3. **Output**: The result is printed as a fraction for accuracy.

### Answer:
The cube root of \(1953 \frac{1}{8}\) chi is approximately \(a\) chi, where \(a\) is the result of the calculation.
