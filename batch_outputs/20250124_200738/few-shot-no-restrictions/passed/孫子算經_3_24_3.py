今有物，不知其數。三三數之，賸二；五五數之，賸三；七七數之，賸二。問：物幾何？
術曰：三三數之，賸二，置一百四十；五五數之，賸三，置六十三；七七數之，賸二，置三十。并之，得二百三十三，以二百一十減之，即得。凡三三數之，賸一，則置七十；五五數之，賸一，則置二十一；七七數之，賸一，則置十五。一百六以上，以一百五減之，即得。
答曰： a 。

This is a classic Chinese remainder theorem problem from ancient Chinese mathematics. The problem involves finding a number that satisfies the following modular congruences:

1. When divided by 3, the remainder is 2.
2. When divided by 5, the remainder is 3.
3. When divided by 7, the remainder is 2.

The procedure involves using specific coefficients to solve the congruences. Let's translate this into Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from sympy import mod_inverse

# Define the modular system
moduli = [3, 5, 7]
remainders = [2, 3, 2]

# Calculate the product of all moduli
N = 1
for modulus in moduli:
    N *= modulus

# Calculate the solution using the Chinese Remainder Theorem
x = 0
for modulus, remainder in zip(moduli, remainders):
    Ni = N // modulus  # Calculate the partial product
    inverse = mod_inverse(Ni, modulus)  # Modular inverse of Ni mod modulus
    x += remainder * Ni * inverse  # Add the contribution of this congruence

# The solution is the smallest positive x
a = x % N

print(f"The answer is: {a}")
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Moduli and Remainders**: The `moduli` list contains the divisors (3, 5, 7), and the `remainders` list contains the corresponding remainders (2, 3, 2).
2. **Product of Moduli**: `N` is the product of all moduli, i.e., \( N = 3 \times 5 \times 7 = 105 \).
3. **Chinese Remainder Theorem**: For each modulus, calculate the partial product \( N_i = N / \text{modulus} \), find its modular inverse, and compute the contribution to the solution.
4. **Final Solution**: The solution \( x \) is reduced modulo \( N \) to find the smallest positive solution.

### Output:
The answer \( a \) will be printed as the smallest number satisfying all the given conditions.
