今有物，不知其數。三三數之，賸二；五五數之，賸三；七七數之，賸二。問：物幾何？
術曰：三三數之，賸二，置一百四十；五五數之，賸三，置六十三；七七數之，賸二，置三十。并之，得二百三十三，以二百一十減之，即得。凡三三數之，賸一，則置七十；五五數之，賸一，則置二十一；七七數之，賸一，則置十五。一百六以上，以一百五減之，即得。
答曰： a 。

"""
This is a classic Chinese Remainder Theorem problem. The problem states:

"""
There is an unknown number of objects. When counted in groups of 3, there is a remainder of 2. When counted in groups of 5, there is a remainder of 3. When counted in groups of 7, there is a remainder of 2. 
Question: What is the number of objects?

The procedure says:
- For the remainder of 2 when divided by 3, place 140.
- For the remainder of 3 when divided by 5, place 63.
- For the remainder of 2 when divided by 7, place 30.
- Add these together, obtaining 233. Subtract 210 from it, and the result is the answer.

If the remainders are all 1:
- For the remainder of 1 when divided by 3, place 70.
- For the remainder of 1 when divided by 5, place 21.
- For the remainder of 1 when divided by 7, place 15.
- If the result is greater than 150, subtract 105 to obtain the answer.

Answer: *a*.
"""

Here is the Python implementation of the procedure:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from sympy import mod_inverse

# Given remainders and moduli
remainders = [2, 3, 2]
moduli = [3, 5, 7]

# Calculate the product of all moduli
N = 1
for modulus in moduli:
    N *= modulus

# Calculate the solution using the Chinese Remainder Theorem
x = 0
for remainder, modulus in zip(remainders, moduli):
    Ni = N // modulus  # Calculate N_i
    inverse = mod_inverse(Ni, modulus)  # Modular inverse of N_i mod modulus
    x += remainder * Ni * inverse

# Reduce x modulo N to get the smallest positive solution
a = x % N

print(f"The number of objects is: {a}")
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input the remainders and moduli**: The remainders are `[2, 3, 2]` and the moduli are `[3, 5, 7]`.
2. **Calculate the product of all moduli**: `N = 3 * 5 * 7 = 105`.
3. **Iterate through each modulus**:
   - Compute `N_i = N / modulus`.
   - Compute the modular inverse of `N_i` modulo `modulus`.
   - Add the term `remainder * N_i * inverse` to the solution `x`.
4. **Reduce `x` modulo `N`**: This ensures the solution is the smallest positive integer satisfying the conditions.

### Output:
The number of objects is `a = 23`.
