開方術曰：置積為實。借一算步之，超一等。議所得，以一乘所借一算為法，而以除。除已，倍法為定法。其復除。折法而下。復置借算步之如初，以復議一乘之，所得副，以加定法，以除。以所得副從定法。復除折下如前。若開之不盡者為不可開，當以面命之。若實有分者，通分內子為定實。乃開之，訖，開其母報除。若母不可開者，又以母乘定實，乃開之，訖，令如母而一。

This problem involves finding the square root of a given area (71,824 square bu) to determine the side length of a square field. The ancient Chinese "开方术" (square root extraction method) is described in detail, but it is essentially a manual algorithm for extracting square roots. Below is the Python implementation of the procedure:

from fractions import Fraction

# 積七萬一千八百二十四步
積 = 71824

# 開方術 (Square root extraction method)
def 開方術(積):
    # Step 1: Place the area as the dividend (實)
    實 = 積

    # Step 2: Start with an initial guess for the square root
    # Find the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the first digit(s) of 實
    借算 = 0
    while (借算 + 1) ** 2 <= 實:
        借算 += 1

    # Step 3: Subtract the square of the guess from 實
    剩餘 = 實 - 借算 ** 2

    # Step 4: Double the guess to form the "定法" (fixed divisor)
    定法 = 2 * 借算

    # Step 5: Iteratively refine the square root
    while 剩餘 > 0:
        # Bring down the next digit (if any) to form a new dividend
        剩餘 *= 100  # Simulating bringing down two digits
        next_digit = 0

        # Find the largest digit such that (定法 * 10 + digit) * digit <= 剩餘
        while (定法 * 10 + next_digit + 1) * (next_digit + 1) <= 剩餘:
            next_digit += 1

        # Update 定法 and 剩餘
        定法 = 定法 * 10 + next_digit
        剩餘 -= (定法 * next_digit)

    # Step 6: If there is no remainder, the square root is exact
    return 借算

# Calculate the square root
a = 開方術(積)

### Explanation of the Algorithm:
1. **Initial Guess**: Start by finding the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the given area.
2. **Subtract Square**: Subtract the square of the guess from the area to get the remainder.
3. **Double the Guess**: Double the current guess to form the "fixed divisor" for the next step.
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Bring down the next digits (simulating decimal places) and refine the square root by finding the next digit that satisfies the condition.
5. **Exact or Approximate**: If the remainder becomes zero, the square root is exact. Otherwise, the process can be continued to find an approximate square root.

### Answer:
The side length of the square field is `a` bu.
