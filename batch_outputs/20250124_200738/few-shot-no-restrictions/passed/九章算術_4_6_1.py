今有田廣一步半、三分步之一、四分步之一、五分步之一、六分步之一、七分步之一、八分步之一。求田一畝，問︰從幾何？
術曰：下有八分，以一為八百四十，半為四百二十，三分之一為二百八十，四分之一為二百一十，五分之一為一百六十八，六分之一為一百四十，七分之一為一百二十，八分之一為一百五，并之得二千二百八十三，以為法。置田二百四十步，亦以一為八百四十乘之，為實。實如法得從步。
荅曰： a步 。

Suppose there is a field with a width of 1.5 bu, plus 1/3 bu, plus 1/4 bu, plus 1/5 bu, plus 1/6 bu, plus 1/7 bu, plus 1/8 bu. A field of 1 mu is sought.
Question: how large is the length?

The procedure says: Below, there are 8 parts. Take 1 as 840, half as 420, 1/3 as 280, 1/4 as 210, 1/5 as 168, 1/6 as 140, 1/7 as 120, and 1/8 as 105. Add these, obtaining 2283 as the divisor.
Place the field of 240 bu, and also multiply it by taking 1 as 840, giving the dividend.
Do the division, obtaining the number of bu of the length.

The answer says: *a* bu.
