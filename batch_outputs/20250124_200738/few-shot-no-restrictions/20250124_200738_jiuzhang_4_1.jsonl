Place the area as the dividend. Borrow one digit at a time, skipping one place each time.  \n2. Estimate the first digit of the root. Multiply the estimate by itself to form the divisor. Divide the dividend by the divisor.  \n3. Double the divisor to form the \"fixed divisor\" for the next step.  \n4. Repeat the process by appending the next digit to the remainder, estimating the next digit of the root, and updating the divisor.  \n5. If the root cannot be extracted exactly, the result is approximate.  \n6.
