假令有句弦相乘冪一千三百三十七二十分之一，弦多股一、十分之一。問：股多少？
術曰：冪自乘，倍多而一，為立冪。又多再自乘，半之，減立冪，余為實。又多數自乘，倍之，為方法。又置多數，五之，二而一，為廉法，從。開立方除之，即股。案：此術脫簡既多，法亦煩擾，宜雲冪自乘，多數而一，所得四之，為實。多為廉法，從。立方開之，得減差，半之，即股。
答曰： a 。

This problem involves solving for the "leg" (股) of a right triangle given the product of the hypotenuse (弦) and the base (句), as well as the relationship between the hypotenuse and the base. The problem is complex and involves cubic equations. Below is the Python implementation of the described procedure:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction
from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify

# Given values
冪 = Fraction(1337, 20)  # The product of the hypotenuse and the base
多 = 1 + Fraction(1, 10)  # The hypotenuse is greater than the base by 1 + 1/10

# Step 1: 冪自乘，倍多而一，為立冪
立冪 = 冪**2 * (2 * 多 + 1)

# Step 2: 又多再自乘，半之，減立冪，余為實
實 = (多**2 / 2) - 立冪

# Step 3: 又多數自乘，倍之，為方法
方法 = 2 * 多**2

# Step 4: 又置多數，五之，二而一，為廉法，從
廉法 = (5 * 多) / 2

# Step 5: 開立方除之，即股
# Simplified procedure: 冪自乘，多數而一，所得四之，為實
實 = (冪**2 * (多 + 1)) / 4

# 多為廉法，從。立方開之，得減差，半之，即股
x = symbols('x')  # Symbol for 股
equation = x**3 - 實 / 廉法
股 = solve(equation, x)

# Simplify the result
a = simplify(股[0])  # The first solution is the valid one

print(f"答曰：股為 {a}")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Values**:
   - `冪` is the product of the hypotenuse and the base, given as \( \frac{1337}{20} \).
   - `多` is the difference between the hypotenuse and the base, given as \( 1 + \frac{1}{10} \).

2. **Procedure**:
   - The procedure involves calculating intermediate values (`立冪`, `實`, `方法`, `廉法`) as described in the problem.
   - The simplified procedure is used to compute the final value of the leg (股).

3. **Cubic Equation**:
   - The problem ultimately reduces to solving a cubic equation for the leg (股).
   - The cubic equation is solved symbolically using `sympy`.

4. **Output**:
   - The solution for the leg (股) is printed as a simplified fraction.

### Note:
This problem is mathematically complex and involves symbolic computation. The solution assumes the use of Python libraries like `sympy` for solving equations and handling fractions. If you have specific questions about the procedure or the math, feel free to ask!
