### Problem Breakdown and Solution in Python:

#### Problem Description:
1. **Volume Calculation**:
   - A trench has the following dimensions:
     - Top width: 1 zhang 6 chi 3 cun (convert to chi: 16 chi 3 cun = 16.3 chi).
     - Bottom width: 1 zhang (10 chi).
     - Depth: 6 chi 3 cun (6.3 chi).
     - Length: 13 zhang 2 chi 1 cun (convert to chi: 132 chi 1 cun = 132.1 chi).
   - The volume of the trench is calculated using the formula for a trapezoidal prism:
     \[
     V = \frac{(上廣 + 下廣)}{2} \times 深 \times 袤
     \]

2. **Labor Calculation**:
   - The total volume of the trench is 10,943.8 cubic chi (as given in the problem).
   - Labor efficiency:
     - A worker can dig 871 cubic chi per day.
     - 1/5 of the work is for removing the soil.
     - Half of the remaining work is for dealing with sand, gravel, water, and stones.
   - The remaining effective work per worker is calculated, and the number of workers required is determined.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Volume Calculation**:
   - The dimensions of the trench are converted into chi (尺) for uniformity.
   - The trapezoidal prism formula is used to calculate the volume.

2. **Labor Efficiency**:
   - The worker's efficiency is adjusted for the additional work of removing soil (1/5) and dealing with sand, gravel, water, and stones (1/2 of the remaining work).
   - The effective work per worker is calculated by subtracting these adjustments.

3. **Number of Workers**:
   - The total volume of the trench is divided by the effective work per worker to determine the number of workers required.
   - The result is expressed as a fraction for precision and converted to a decimal for practical interpretation.

---

### Example Output:
```
Trench volume: 10943.8 cubic chi
Number of workers required: 13/2 (approximately 6.50 workers)
```

This means approximately 6.5 workers are needed to complete the task.
