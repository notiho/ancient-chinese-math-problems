假令有句弦相乘冪一千三百三十七二十分之一，弦多股一、十分之一。問：股多少？
術曰：冪自乘，倍多而一，為立冪。又多再自乘，半之，減立冪，余為實。又多數自乘，倍之，為方法。又置多數，五之，二而一，為廉法，從。開立方除之，即股。案：此術脫簡既多，法亦煩擾，宜雲冪自乘，多數而一，所得四之，為實。多為廉法，從。立方開之，得減差，半之，即股。
答曰： a 。

This is a classic problem involving the Pythagorean theorem and cubic equations. Let's break it down step by step and translate the procedure into Python code.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given**:
   - The product of the leg (股, `gou`) and hypotenuse (弦, `xian`) is \( 1337 \frac{1}{20} \).
   - The hypotenuse (弦, `xian`) exceeds the other leg (股, `gou`) by \( 1 \frac{1}{10} \).

2. **Question**:
   - Find the length of the other leg (股, `gou`).

3. **Procedure**:
   - The original procedure involves solving a cubic equation derived from the Pythagorean theorem and the given conditions. The text also provides a simplified method for solving the problem.

### Python Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction
from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq

# Given values
冪 = Fraction(1337, 20)  # 冪 (product of 股 and 弦)
多 = Fraction(11, 10)    # 弦 exceeds 股 by 1 1/10 (多)

# Simplified procedure:
# 冪自乘，多數而一，所得四之，為實
實 = (冪 * 冪) * (多 + 1) / 4

# 多為廉法，從
廉法 = 多

# Solve the cubic equation:
# x^3 + 廉法 * x^2 - 實 = 0
x = symbols('x')
equation = Eq(x**3 + 廉法 * x**2 - 實, 0)
solutions = solve(equation, x)

# Find the positive real solution (股)
for solution in solutions:
    if solution.is_real and solution > 0:
        股 = solution
        break

# Output the result
a = 股
print(f"股 (gou) = {a}")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Values**:
   - The product of the leg and hypotenuse (`冪`) is converted to a fraction for precise calculations.
   - The difference between the hypotenuse and the leg (`多`) is also expressed as a fraction.

2. **Simplified Procedure**:
   - The simplified method provided in the text is used to calculate the "實" value.
   - The cubic equation is constructed using the relationship between the leg, hypotenuse, and the given conditions.

3. **Solving the Cubic Equation**:
   - The cubic equation is solved symbolically using `sympy`.
   - The positive real solution is selected as the length of the leg (`股`).

4. **Output**:
   - The result is stored in `a` and printed.

---

### Example Output:
If you run the code, it will compute the value of `股` (the leg) based on the given conditions. The exact numerical result will depend on solving the cubic equation.
