今有塹上廣一丈六尺三寸，下廣一丈，深六尺三寸，袤一十三丈二尺一寸。問︰積幾何？
荅曰：一萬九百四十三尺八寸。
夏程人功八百七十一尺。并出土功五分之一，沙礫水石之功作太半，定功二百三十二尺、一十五分尺之四。問︰用徒幾何？
術曰：置本人功，去其出土功五分之一，又去沙礫水石之功太半，餘為法。以塹積尺為實。實如法而一，即用徒人數。
荅曰： a人 。

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Volume Calculation**:
   - The trench has the following dimensions:
     - Top width: 1 zhang 6 chi 3 cun (1丈6尺3寸)
     - Bottom width: 1 zhang (1丈)
     - Depth: 6 chi 3 cun (6尺3寸)
     - Length: 13 zhang 2 chi 1 cun (13丈2尺1寸)
   - The volume of the trench is calculated using the formula for a trapezoidal prism:
     \[
     V = \frac{1}{2} \times (上廣 + 下廣) \times 深 \times 袤
     \]

2. **Labor Calculation**:
   - The volume of the trench is 10,943 chi 8 cun (10,943尺8寸).
   - A worker can dig 871 chi of earth per day (夏程人功 871尺).
   - Adjustments:
     - Subtract 1/5 of the labor for "removing earth" (出土功五分之一).
     - Subtract half of the labor for "gravel, water, and stones" (沙礫水石之功作太半).
   - The remaining labor is the divisor.
   - Divide the trench volume by the adjusted labor to determine the number of workers required.

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Volume Calculation**:
   - The dimensions are converted into chi (尺) for consistency.
   - The trapezoidal prism formula is used to calculate the volume.

2. **Labor Adjustment**:
   - The labor per worker is adjusted by subtracting 1/5 for "removing earth" and 1/2 for "gravel, water, and stones."

3. **Worker Calculation**:
   - The trench volume is divided by the adjusted labor to determine the number of workers required.

4. **Output**:
   - The result is displayed as a mixed number (whole workers and fractional labor).

---

### Example Output:

```
Trench volume: 10943 8/10 尺
Adjusted labor per worker: 348 4/5 尺
Number of workers required: 31 full workers and 1/5 of a worker's labor
```
