假令有句弦相乘冪一千三百三十七二十分之一，弦多股一、十分之一。問：股多少？
術曰：冪自乘，倍多而一，為立冪。又多再自乘，半之，減立冪，余為實。又多數自乘，倍之，為方法。又置多數，五之，二而一，為廉法，從。開立方除之，即股。案：此術脫簡既多，法亦煩擾，宜雲冪自乘，多數而一，所得四之，為實。多為廉法，從。立方開之，得減差，半之，即股。
答曰： a 。

This is a classic problem from ancient Chinese mathematics, involving the Pythagorean theorem and cubic equations. Let's translate the problem and solution into Python step by step.

### Problem Description:
Suppose the product of the leg (股, `gou`) and the hypotenuse (弦, `xian`) is given as \( 1337 \frac{1}{20} \) (or \( \frac{26741}{20} \)). The hypotenuse exceeds the other leg (股, `gou`) by \( 1 \frac{1}{10} \) (or \( \frac{11}{10} \)). 

Question: What is the length of the other leg (股, `gou`)?

---

### Procedure:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The given product of the leg and hypotenuse is called the "power" (冪, `mi`).
   - The difference between the hypotenuse and the leg is called "difference" (多, `duo`).

2. **Simplified Method**:
   - Multiply the power (`mi`) by the difference (`duo`), divide by 4, and call the result the "actual value" (實, `shi`).
   - Use the difference (`duo`) as the divisor (廉法, `lianfa`).
   - Extract the cube root of the actual value (`shi`) divided by the divisor (`lianfa`).
   - Subtract the result from the difference (`duo`), divide by 2, and the result is the leg (`gou`).

### Python Code:

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction
from sympy import cbrt  # For cube root

# Given values
mi = Fraction(26741, 20)  # 冪 (product of leg and hypotenuse)
duo = Fraction(11, 10)    # 多 (difference between hypotenuse and leg)

# Simplified method:
# Step 1: Calculate the actual value (實, shi)
shi = (mi * duo) / 4

# Step 2: Use the difference as the divisor (廉法, lianfa)
lianfa = duo

# Step 3: Extract the cube root of shi / lianfa
cube_root = cbrt(shi / lianfa)

# Step 4: Subtract the cube root from the difference, divide by 2 to get the leg (股, gou)
gou = (duo - cube_root) / 2

# Output the result
a = gou
print(f"The length of the leg (股) is: {a}")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Fractions**: We use the `Fraction` class to handle all fractional arithmetic precisely.
2. **Cube Root**: The `sympy.cbrt` function is used to compute the cube root of a number.
3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**: The code follows the simplified procedure described in the problem, ensuring clarity and correctness.

---

### Answer:
The length of the leg (股) is `a`. Run the code to compute the exact value.
