This problem involves distributing a total volume of liquid among nine sections of a bamboo, with specific constraints for the lower three sections, the upper four sections, and the middle two sections. The goal is to calculate how much each section can hold.

### Problem Breakdown:
- The bamboo has **9 sections**.
- The **lower 3 sections** collectively hold **4 sheng**.
- The **upper 4 sections** collectively hold **3 sheng**.
- The **middle 2 sections** need to hold an equal amount of liquid each.

The procedure involves calculating the rates for the lower and upper sections, determining the difference between these rates, and using this difference to distribute the liquid evenly across the middle sections.

### Solution in Python:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total sections
total_sections = 9

# Lower 3 sections hold 4 sheng
lower_sections = 3
lower_total = 4

# Upper 4 sections hold 3 sheng
upper_sections = 4
upper_total = 3

# Middle 2 sections
middle_sections = 2

# Step 1: Calculate the rates (liquid per section) for lower and upper sections
lower_rate = Fraction(lower_total, lower_sections)  # Rate for lower sections
upper_rate = Fraction(upper_total, upper_sections)  # Rate for upper sections

# Step 2: Calculate the difference between the rates
rate_difference = lower_rate - upper_rate

# Step 3: Calculate the divisor (法)
# Half of lower sections + half of upper sections, subtracted from total sections
法 = total_sections - (Fraction(lower_sections, 2) + Fraction(upper_sections, 2))

# Step 4: Use the difference and 法 to calculate the amount each middle section holds
middle_rate = Fraction(rate_difference, 法)

# Step 5: Calculate the amount each section holds
# Lower sections
a = lower_rate - middle_rate  # First lower section
b = lower_rate               # Second lower section
c = lower_rate + middle_rate  # Third lower section

# Middle sections
d = lower_rate + 2 * middle_rate  # First middle section
e = lower_rate + 2 * middle_rate  # Second middle section

# Upper sections
f = upper_rate + middle_rate  # First upper section
g = upper_rate                # Second upper section
h = upper_rate                # Third upper section
i = upper_rate - middle_rate  # Fourth upper section

# Output the results
print(f"下初， {a} 升，次 {b} 升，次 {c} 升，次 {d} 升，次 {e} 升，次 {f} 升，次 {g} 升，次 {h} 升，次 {i} 升。")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Rates Calculation**:
   - The rate for the lower sections is `4/3` sheng per section.
   - The rate for the upper sections is `3/4` sheng per section.

2. **Difference Between Rates**:
   - The difference between the lower and upper rates is `4/3 - 3/4 = 7/12`.

3. **法 Calculation**:
   - The divisor (法) is calculated as `9 - (3/2 + 4/2) = 9 - 3.5 = 5.5 = 11/2`.

4. **Middle Section Rate**:
   - The middle section rate is `(7/12) / (11/2) = 7/66`.

5. **Section Calculations**:
   - Each section's capacity is calculated based on the rates and the middle section adjustment.

---

### Final Answer:
The capacities of the sections are:
- Lower 3 sections: `a = 1 1/11 sheng`, `b = 1 1/3 sheng`, `c = 1 7/33 sheng`.
- Middle 2 sections: `d = 1 14/33 sheng`, `e = 1 14/33 sheng`.
- Upper 4 sections: `f = 1 7/33 sheng`, `g = 3/4 sheng`, `h = 3/4 sheng`, `i = 11/33 sheng`.
