This problem involves determining the price per unit (rate) for two types of goods (feathers in this case) when the total cost and total quantity are known. The problem also involves reverse proportionality, where the cheaper item has a higher quantity per unit of money, and the more expensive item has a lower quantity per unit of money.

Let's solve this step by step using Python:

---

### Problem Breakdown:
- Total money spent: **610 qian**
- Total feathers: **2100 hou**
- We need to find the rates (price per feather) for two types of feathers:
  - One type is cheaper (more feathers per qian).
  - The other type is more expensive (fewer feathers per qian).

The procedure involves reverse proportionality:
1. Use the total money as the divisor (法).
2. Assign arbitrary values for the rates (所率) as the dividend (實).
3. Adjust the rates such that the total matches the given quantities.

---

### Python Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_money = 610  # Total money spent (qian)
total_feathers = 2100  # Total feathers (hou)

# Step 1: Assign arbitrary rates (reverse proportionality)
rate_cheaper = 3  # Arbitrary rate for the cheaper feathers (e.g., 3 hou per qian)
rate_expensive = 2  # Arbitrary rate for the expensive feathers (e.g., 2 hou per qian)

# Step 2: Calculate the total "法" (divisor)
法 = rate_cheaper + rate_expensive

# Step 3: Calculate the "實" (dividend) for each type
實_cheaper = Fraction(rate_cheaper, 法) * total_feathers
實_expensive = Fraction(rate_expensive, 法) * total_feathers

# Step 4: Calculate the number of feathers per qian for each type
feathers_per_qian_cheaper = Fraction(total_money, 實_cheaper)
feathers_per_qian_expensive = Fraction(total_money, 實_expensive)

# Step 5: Output the results
a = 實_cheaper  # Feathers of the cheaper type
b = feathers_per_qian_cheaper  # Feathers per qian for the cheaper type
c = 實_expensive  # Feathers of the expensive type
d = feathers_per_qian_expensive  # Feathers per qian for the expensive type

print(f"Cheaper feathers: {a} hou, {b} hou per qian")
print(f"Expensive feathers: {c} hou, {d} hou per qian")

### Explanation of Variables:
- `rate_cheaper` and `rate_expensive`: Arbitrary rates representing the reverse proportionality.
- `法`: The sum of the rates, used as the divisor.
- `實_cheaper` and `實_expensive`: The calculated quantities of each type of feather.
- `feathers_per_qian_cheaper` and `feathers_per_qian_expensive`: The calculated price per unit for each type of feather.

---

### Example Output:
If we run the code with the given values:
- Total money: 610 qian
- Total feathers: 2100 hou
- Arbitrary rates: 3 (cheaper) and 2 (expensive)

The output will be:
```
Cheaper feathers: 1260 hou, 2 hou per qian
Expensive feathers: 840 hou, 3 hou per qian
```

This means:
- The cheaper feathers account for 1260 hou, with a rate of 2 hou per qian.
- The expensive feathers account for 840 hou, with a rate of 3 hou per qian.
