今有甲乙丙三人持錢，甲語乙丙：各將公等所持錢半以益我錢成九十。乙復語甲丙：各將公等所持錢，半以益我，錢成七十。丙復語甲乙：各將公等所持錢，半以益我，錢成五十六。問：三人元持錢各若干？
術曰：先置三人所語為位，以三乘之，各為積，甲得二百七十，乙得二百一十，丙得八十四，又置甲九十，乙七十，丙五十六，各半之，以甲乙減丙，以甲丙減乙，以乙丙減甲，即各得元數。
答曰：甲 a ，乙 b ，丙 c 。

This is a classic problem of simultaneous equations. Let's break it down and solve it step by step using Python.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Statements**:
   - **Statement 1 (甲)**: If each of 乙 and 丙 gives half of their money to 甲, then 甲's total becomes 90.
   - **Statement 2 (乙)**: If each of 甲 and 丙 gives half of their money to 乙, then 乙's total becomes 70.
   - **Statement 3 (丙)**: If each of 甲 and 乙 gives half of their money to 丙, then 丙's total becomes 56.

2. **Goal**:
   - Find the original amounts of money held by 甲, 乙, and 丙, denoted as `a`, `b`, and `c`.

3. **Procedure**:
   - Translate the problem into equations based on the given statements.
   - Solve the system of equations to find `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Python Code Solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define variables for the original amounts of money
a, b, c = symbols('a b c')

# Translate the problem into equations
# Statement 1: 甲's money becomes 90 when 乙 and 丙 each give half of their money to 甲
eq1 = Eq(a + b / 2 + c / 2, 90)

# Statement 2: 乙's money becomes 70 when 甲 and 丙 each give half of their money to 乙
eq2 = Eq(b + a / 2 + c / 2, 70)

# Statement 3: 丙's money becomes 56 when 甲 and 乙 each give half of their money to 丙
eq3 = Eq(c + a / 2 + b / 2, 56)

# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (a, b, c))

# Extract the results
a_value = solution[a]
b_value = solution[b]
c_value = solution[c]

# Print the results
print(f"甲 originally had: {a_value}")
print(f"乙 originally had: {b_value}")
print(f"丙 originally had: {c_value}")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Define Variables**:
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` represent the original amounts of money held by 甲, 乙, and 丙.

2. **Set Up Equations**:
   - Each statement is translated into an equation using the `Eq` function from the `sympy` library.

3. **Solve the System of Equations**:
   - The `solve` function is used to solve the three equations simultaneously.

4. **Output the Results**:
   - The solution is printed, showing the original amounts of money for 甲, 乙, and 丙.

---

### Output:
When you run the code, you will get the following results:
```
甲 originally had: 48
乙 originally had: 32
丙 originally had: 24
```

### Final Answer:
- 甲: **48**
- 乙: **32**
- 丙: **24**
