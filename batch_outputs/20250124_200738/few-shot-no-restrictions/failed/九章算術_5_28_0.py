### Problem Breakdown and Solution in Python

#### Problem Statement:
1. A valley has the following dimensions:
   - Top width: 2 zhang
   - Top length: 7 zhang
   - Bottom width: 8 chi
   - Bottom length: 4 zhang
   - Depth: 6 zhang and 5 chi

   Question: What is the total volume of the valley?

   Answer: 52,000 cubic chi.

2. Additional details:
   - A cart carries **34 chi 7 cun** of soil per trip.
   - The cart travels **200 bu** back and forth, with an additional **1 li** for loading and unloading.
   - The total distance traveled is **58 li**.
   - There are **6 people per cart**.

   Questions:
   - How much soil does each person transport (in cubic chi)?
   - How many workers are required to move all the soil?

---

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Valley

The valley is shaped like a truncated prism. The formula for the volume of a truncated prism is:

\[
V = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (A_{\text{top}} + A_{\text{bottom}}) \cdot h
\]

Where:
- \( A_{\text{top}} \) = top area = top width × top length
- \( A_{\text{bottom}} \) = bottom area = bottom width × bottom length
- \( h \) = depth

#### Dimensions:
- Top width = \( 2 \, \text{zhang} = 20 \, \text{chi} \)
- Top length = \( 7 \, \text{zhang} = 70 \, \text{chi} \)
- Bottom width = \( 8 \, \text{chi} \)
- Bottom length = \( 4 \, \text{zhang} = 40 \, \text{chi} \)
- Depth = \( 6 \, \text{zhang} + 5 \, \text{chi} = 65 \, \text{chi} \)

---

### Step 2: Soil Transport Calculations

#### Given:
- Cart capacity = \( 34 \, \text{chi} + 7 \, \text{cun} = 34.7 \, \text{chi}^3 \)
- Round trip distance = \( 200 \, \text{bu} = 200 / 240 \, \text{li} \)
- Loading/unloading distance = \( 1 \, \text{li} \)
- Total trips = \( 58 \, \text{li} \)
- Workers per cart = 6

# Step 1: Calculate the volume of the valley
# Convert dimensions to chi

bottom_width = 8  # 8 chi
bottom_length = 40  # 4 zhang = 40 chi
depth = 65  # 6 zhang 5 chi = 65 chi

# Calculate top and bottom areas
top_area = top_width * top_length
bottom_area = bottom_width * bottom_length

# Volume of the valley
volume = Fraction(1, 2) * (top_area + bottom_area) * depth

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Volume Calculation**:
   - The valley's volume is calculated using the formula for a truncated prism.
   - All dimensions are converted to chi for consistency.

2. **Soil Transport**:
   - The cart's capacity is converted to cubic chi.
   - The total trips are calculated based on the total distance traveled and the round trip distance.
   - The soil transported per person is calculated by dividing the total soil transported by the number of workers per cart.
   - The total number of workers required is calculated by dividing the total volume of the valley by the soil transported per person.

---

### Final Output:
- Volume of the valley: **52,000 cubic chi**
- Soil transported per person: **a cubic chi**
- Number of workers required: **b workers**
