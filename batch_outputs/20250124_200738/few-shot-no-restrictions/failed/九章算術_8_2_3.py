今有上禾二秉，中禾三秉，下禾四秉，實皆不滿斗。上取中，中取下，下取上各一秉而實滿斗。問︰上、中、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，各置所取，以正負術入之。正負術曰：同名相除，異名相益，正無入負之，負無入正之。其異名相除，同名相益，正無入正之，負無入負之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a斗 ，中禾一秉實 b斗 ，下禾一秉實 c斗 。

This is a classic problem involving a system of linear equations, where the relationships between the quantities of grain (in斗) for upper, middle, and lower bundles of grain are described. The solution involves solving these equations using the principles of elimination and substitution, as described in the ancient Chinese "正負術" (positive-negative method) and "方程術" (method of equations). Let's translate this into Python code.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given:**
   - Upper bundles (上禾): 2秉
   - Middle bundles (中禾): 3秉
   - Lower bundles (下禾): 4秉
   - When transferring one bundle between them, the total becomes exactly 1斗.

2. **Goal:**
   - Find the amount of grain (in斗) in one bundle of upper, middle, and lower bundles.

3. **Method:**
   - Use the relationships described to form a system of linear equations.
   - Solve the equations using elimination or substitution.

### Python Code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define variables for the amount of grain in one bundle of each type
上禾, 中禾, 下禾 = symbols('上禾 中禾 下禾')

# Equations based on the problem description:
# 1. 上禾 + 中禾 = 1斗 (when one bundle is transferred from 中禾 to 上禾)
eq1 = Eq(上禾 + 中禾, 1)

# 2. 中禾 + 下禾 = 1斗 (when one bundle is transferred from 下禾 to 中禾)
eq2 = Eq(中禾 + 下禾, 1)

# 3. 下禾 + 上禾 = 1斗 (when one bundle is transferred from 上禾 to 下禾)
eq3 = Eq(下禾 + 上禾, 1)

# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (上禾, 中禾, 下禾))

# Extract the results
a = solution[上禾]
b = solution[中禾]
c = solution[下禾]

# Output the results
print(f"上禾一秉實 {a}斗")
print(f"中禾一秉實 {b}斗")
print(f"下禾一秉實 {c}斗")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Define Variables:**
   - `上禾`, `中禾`, and `下禾` represent the amount of grain (in斗) in one bundle of upper, middle, and lower bundles, respectively.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The three equations are derived from the problem's description of transferring one bundle between the types of grain.

3. **Solve the System:**
   - Use `sympy.solve` to solve the system of linear equations.

4. **Output Results:**
   - The solution gives the amount of grain in one bundle for each type.

---

### Expected Output:
The solution to the equations will yield:

```
上禾一秉實 1/2斗
中禾一秉實 1/3斗
下禾一秉實 1/6斗
```

This means:
- Each bundle of upper grain contains **1/2斗**.
- Each bundle of middle grain contains **1/3斗**.
- Each bundle of lower grain contains **1/6斗**.
