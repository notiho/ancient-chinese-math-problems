假令有句股相乘冪七百六十五分之一，弦多於句三十六十分之九。問：三事各多少？
術曰：冪自乘，倍多數而一，為實。半多數，為廉法，從。開立方除之，即句。以弦多句加之，即弦。以句除冪，即股。
答曰：句 a ，股 b ，弦 c 。

"""
This is a classic problem involving a right triangle with a given hypotenuse (弦), base (句), and height (股). The problem provides the following information:

1. The product of the base (句) and height (股) is \( \frac{1}{765} \) (冪).
2. The hypotenuse (弦) exceeds the base (句) by \( \frac{9}{36} = \frac{1}{4} \).

The goal is to find the values of the base (句), height (股), and hypotenuse (弦).

---

### Procedure:
1. The square of the given product (冪) is multiplied by twice the excess of the hypotenuse over the base, plus 1. This gives the dividend (實).
2. Half of the excess of the hypotenuse over the base is taken as the divisor (廉法).
3. The cube root of the division gives the base (句).
4. Adding the excess to the base gives the hypotenuse (弦).
5. Dividing the product (冪) by the base gives the height (股).

# Given values
冪 = Fraction(1, 765)  # The product of the base and height
弦多句 = Fraction(9, 36)  # The hypotenuse exceeds the base by 9/36 = 1/4

# Step 1: 冪自乘
冪平方 = 冪 ** 2

# Step 2: 倍多數而一，為實
倍多數 = 2 * 弦多句
實 = 冪平方 * (倍多數 + 1)

# Step 3: 半多數，為廉法
廉法 = 弦多句 / 2

# Step 4: 開立方除之，即句
句 = (實 / 廉法) ** (1 / 3)

# Step 5: 以弦多句加之，即弦
弦 = 句 + 弦多句

# Step 6: 以句除冪，即股
股 = 冪 / 句

a = 句
b = 股
c = 弦

print(f"股 (Height) = {b}")

### Explanation of Variables:
- \( 冪 \): The product of the base and height (\( \frac{1}{765} \)).
- \( 弦多句 \): The difference between the hypotenuse and the base (\( \frac{1}{4} \)).
- \( 實 \): The dividend calculated from the square of the product and the excess of the hypotenuse over the base.
- \( 廉法 \): The divisor, which is half the excess of the hypotenuse over the base.
- \( 句 \): The base of the triangle.
- \( 股 \): The height of the triangle.
- \( 弦 \): The hypotenuse of the triangle.

---

### Final Answer:
The values of \( 句 \) (base), \( 股 \) (height), and \( 弦 \) (hypotenuse) are calculated and printed as fractions for exactness.
