今有五雀、六燕，集稱之衡，雀俱重，燕俱輕。一雀一燕交而處，衡適平。并燕、雀重一斤。問︰燕、雀一枚各重幾何？

荅曰：雀重 a兩 ，燕重 b兩 。

This problem involves determining the weight of a sparrow (雀) and a swallow (燕) based on their combined weight and the fact that one sparrow and one swallow balance each other on a scale. The solution uses a system of equations, which can be solved algebraically.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. There are 5 sparrows and 6 swallows, and their total weight is 1 jin (16 liang).
2. Each sparrow weighs the same, and each swallow weighs the same.
3. When one sparrow and one swallow are placed on a scale, they balance perfectly.
4. We are tasked with finding the weight of one sparrow and one swallow.

---

### Mathematical Representation:
Let:
- \( x \) = weight of one sparrow (in liang),
- \( y \) = weight of one swallow (in liang).

From the problem:
1. \( 5x + 6y = 16 \) (total weight of 5 sparrows and 6 swallows is 1 jin = 16 liang),
2. \( x = y \) (one sparrow balances one swallow).

---

### Solution:
We solve the system of equations:
1. Substitute \( x = y \) into \( 5x + 6y = 16 \):
   \[
   5x + 6x = 16
   \]
   \[
   11x = 16
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{16}{11}
   \]

2. Since \( x = y \), \( y = \frac{16}{11} \).

### Python Code Implementation:

"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the total weight in liang (1 jin = 16 liang)
total_weight = 16

# Solve for the weight of one sparrow (x) and one swallow (y)
sparrow_weight = Fraction(total_weight, 11)  # x = 16 / 11
swallow_weight = Fraction(total_weight, 11)  # y = 16 / 11

# Output the results
a = sparrow_weight
b = swallow_weight

print(f"雀重 {a} 兩，燕重 {b} 兩。")
#----- content ends here -----


"""


---

### Final Answer:
- \( a = \frac{16}{11} \) liang (weight of one sparrow),
- \( b = \frac{16}{11} \) liang (weight of one swallow).
