開方術曰：置積為實。借一算步之，超一等。議所得，以一乘所借一算為法，而以除。除已，倍法為定法。其復除。折法而下。復置借算步之如初，以復議一乘之，所得副，以加定法，以除。以所得副從定法。復除折下如前。若開之不盡者為不可開，當以面命之。若實有分者，通分內子為定實。乃開之，訖，開其母報除。若母不可開者，又以母乘定實，乃開之，訖，令如母而一。

This is a classic ancient Chinese square root problem, where the goal is to find the side length of a square given its area. The procedure described is an ancient method for extracting square roots, which involves iterative approximation. Below is the Python implementation of the procedure.

### Problem:
Given an area of \( 3,970,215,625 \) bu², find the side length of the square.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Parsing**: The given area (\( 3,970,215,625 \)) is treated as a large integer.
2. **Digit Grouping**: The number is divided into groups of two digits from right to left, as described in the ancient method.
3. **Iterative Square Root Extraction**:
   - At each step, the next group of digits is brought down.
   - The next digit of the square root is determined by trial and error, ensuring that the square of the partial root does not exceed the current remainder.
4. **Handling Remainders**: If there is a remainder after the process, the square root is not exact, and the result is approximate.
5. **Output**: The result is displayed as the side length of the square in "bu" (步).

---

### Answer:
For \( 3,970,215,625 \) bu², the side length of the square is:
