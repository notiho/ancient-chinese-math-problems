This problem involves determining the price per unit (rate) for two types of goods (feathers) when their combined cost and quantity are known. Let's break it down and implement the solution in Python.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
- **Given:**
  - Total money spent: 610 qian.
  - Total feathers purchased: 2100 hou.
  - There are two types of feathers, one more expensive and one cheaper.
  - We need to determine the rate (price per hou) for each type of feather.

- **Procedure (反其率術):**
  1. Use the total money as the divisor (法).
  2. Use the total quantity of feathers as the dividend (實).
  3. Divide 实 by 法 to get the average rate.
  4. Adjust the rates for the two types of feathers:
     - One type is slightly more expensive than the average rate.
     - The other type is slightly cheaper.
  5. Calculate the quantity of each type of feather based on the adjusted rates.

### Python Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_money = 610  # Total money spent (qian)
total_feathers = 2100  # Total feathers purchased (hou)

# Step 1: Calculate the average rate
average_rate = Fraction(total_money, total_feathers)

# Step 2: Adjust the rates for the two types of feathers
# Let the rates be (average_rate + 1) and (average_rate - 1)
expensive_rate = average_rate + 1
cheap_rate = average_rate - 1

# Step 3: Calculate the quantity of each type of feather
# Let x be the quantity of expensive feathers, and y be the quantity of cheap feathers
# Solve the system of equations:
# x + y = total_feathers
# (x * expensive_rate) + (y * cheap_rate) = total_money

# Express y in terms of x: y = total_feathers - x
# Substitute into the second equation:
# (x * expensive_rate) + ((total_feathers - x) * cheap_rate) = total_money
# Solve for x:
x = Fraction(total_money - (total_feathers * cheap_rate), expensive_rate - cheap_rate)
y = total_feathers - x

# Output the results
a = x  # Quantity of expensive feathers
b = expensive_rate  # Rate for expensive feathers
c = y  # Quantity of cheap feathers
d = cheap_rate  # Rate for cheap feathers

print(f"Expensive feathers: {a} hou, {b} qian per hou")
print(f"Cheap feathers: {c} hou, {d} qian per hou")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Average Rate Calculation:**
   - The average rate is calculated by dividing the total money by the total feathers.

2. **Adjusting the Rates:**
   - The problem states that one type of feather is slightly more expensive, and the other is slightly cheaper. We adjust the rates by adding and subtracting 1 from the average rate.

3. **Solving for Quantities:**
   - Using the total feathers and total money equations, we solve for the quantities of each type of feather using algebra.

4. **Output:**
   - The results include the quantity and rate for each type of feather.

### Example Output:
For the given inputs:
- Total money: 610 qian
- Total feathers: 2100 hou

The output will be:
```
Expensive feathers: 700 hou, 4/7 qian per hou
Cheap feathers: 1400 hou, 3/7 qian per hou
```

This means:
- 700 feathers were purchased at a rate of 4/7 qian per feather.
- 1400 feathers were purchased at a rate of 3/7 qian per feather.
