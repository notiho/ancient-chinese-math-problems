今有積六萬三千四百一尺、五百一十二分尺之四百四十七。問︰為立方幾何？

This is a classic ancient Chinese problem involving the extraction of a cube root. The problem describes a volume (in fractional units) and asks for the cube root of this volume, which represents the side length of a cube with the given volume.

The procedure for extracting cube roots in ancient Chinese mathematics is quite detailed and involves iterative approximation. Below is the Python implementation of this procedure:

---


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given volume: 63401 and 447/512 chi^3
volume = Fraction(63401) + Fraction(447, 512)

# Function to compute the cube root using the ancient Chinese method
def cube_root(volume, precision=10):
    """
    Compute the cube root of a given volume using an iterative method.
    :param volume: The volume to find the cube root of (as a Fraction).
    :param precision: The number of iterations for precision.
    :return: The cube root as a Fraction.
    """
    # Step 1: Initialize variables
    x = 1  # Start with an initial guess for the cube root
    for _ in range(precision):
        # Step 2: Compute the next approximation
        numerator = 2 * x**3 + volume
        denominator = 3 * x**2
        x = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
    
    return x

# Compute the cube root
a = cube_root(volume)

# Output the result
print(f"The cube root of the given volume is approximately {a} chi.")
#----- content ends here -----


"""

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Volume**: The given volume is expressed as a mixed fraction (63401 and 447/512). This is converted into a single `Fraction` object for precise arithmetic.
2. **Iterative Cube Root Method**: The cube root is approximated iteratively using the ancient Chinese method. The formula for updating the approximation is derived from the procedure described in the problem.
3. **Precision**: The number of iterations (`precision`) determines the accuracy of the result.
4. **Output**: The result is displayed as a fraction, representing the cube root of the given volume.

### Example Output:
For the given volume of \( 63401 \frac{447}{512} \), the program will compute the cube root and output the result as a fraction.
