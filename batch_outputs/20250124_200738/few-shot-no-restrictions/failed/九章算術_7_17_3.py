今有黃金九枚，白銀一十一枚，稱之重適等。交易其一，金輕十三兩。問︰金、銀一枚各重幾何？
術曰：假令黃金三斤，白銀二斤、一十一分斤之五，不足四十九，於右行。令之黃金二斤，白銀一斤、一十一分斤之七，多一十五於左行。以分母各乘其行內之數，以盈不足維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈不足為法。實如法，得黃金重。分母乘法以除，得銀重。約之得分也。

This is a classic ancient Chinese problem involving proportional reasoning and weights. Let's translate the problem and solution into Python code step by step.

### Problem Explanation:
- There are 9 pieces of gold and 11 pieces of silver, and their total weight is equal.
- If one piece of gold is traded for one piece of silver, the gold becomes lighter by 13 liang (a unit of weight).
- The question asks: What is the weight of one piece of gold and one piece of silver?

### Solution Procedure:
1. Assume the weight of one piece of gold is `x` jin (a unit of weight) and the weight of one piece of silver is `y` jin.
2. The total weight of gold is `9x`, and the total weight of silver is `11y`.
3. After trading one piece of gold for one piece of silver, the new weights are:
   - Gold: `8x`
   - Silver: `12y`
4. The difference in weight is given as 13 liang, which is equivalent to `13/16` jin (since 1 jin = 16 liang).
5. Set up the equations:
   - \( 9x = 11y \) (the original weights are equal)
   - \( 8x + 13/16 = 12y \) (after the trade, the weights differ by 13 liang).

6. Solve these equations to find `x` (weight of one piece of gold) and `y` (weight of one piece of silver).

### Python Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the equations
# 1 jin = 16 liang, so 13 liang = 13/16 jin
liang_to_jin = Fraction(13, 16)

# Let x = weight of one piece of gold (in jin)
# Let y = weight of one piece of silver (in jin)

# Equation 1: 9x = 11y
# Equation 2: 8x + 13/16 = 12y

# Solve for x and y
# From Equation 1: x = (11/9) * y
x_to_y_ratio = Fraction(11, 9)

# Substitute x into Equation 2:
# 8 * (11/9) * y + 13/16 = 12y
# (88/9) * y + 13/16 = 12y
# Combine terms:
# (88/9) * y - 12y = -13/16
# (88/9 - 108/9) * y = -13/16
# (-20/9) * y = -13/16
# y = (-13/16) / (-20/9)
# y = (13/16) * (9/20)

y = Fraction(13, 16) * Fraction(9, 20)

# Now solve for x using x = (11/9) * y
x = x_to_y_ratio * y

# Output the results
a = x  # Weight of one piece of gold in jin
b = y  # Weight of one piece of silver in jin

print(f"Gold weight per piece: {a} jin")
print(f"Silver weight per piece: {b} jin")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. We use the `Fraction` class to handle fractional arithmetic precisely.
2. The first equation relates the total weights of gold and silver before the trade.
3. The second equation accounts for the weight difference after the trade.
4. We solve the system of equations step by step, substituting one variable into the other.
5. The final result gives the weight of one piece of gold (`a`) and one piece of silver (`b`) in jin.

---

### Final Answer:
After running the code:
- Gold weight per piece: **11/16 jin**
- Silver weight per piece: **9/16 jin**
