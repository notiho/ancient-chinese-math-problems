今有甲、乙、丙、丁、戊、己、庚、辛、壬、癸九家共輸租，甲出三十五斛，乙出四十六斛，丙出五十七斛，丁出六十八斛，戊出七十九斛，己出八十斛，庚出一百斛，辛出二百一十斛，壬出三百二十五斛，凡九家，共輸租一千斛，僦運直折二百斛外。問：家各幾何？
術曰：置甲出三十五斛，以四乘之，得一百四十斛；以五除之，得二十八斛。乙出四十六斛，以四乘之，得一百八十四斛；以五除之，得三十六斛八斗。丙出五十七斛，以四乘之，得二百二十八斛；以五除之，得四十五斛六斗。丁出六十八斛，以四乘之，得二百七十二斛；以五除之，得五十四斛四斗。戊出七十九斛，以四乘之，得三百一十六斛；以五除之，得六十三斛二斗。己出八十斛，以四乘之，得三百二十斛；以五除之，得六十四斛。庚出一百斛，以四乘之，得四百斛；以五除之，得八十斛。辛出二百一十斛，以四乘之，得八百四十斛；以五除之，得一百六十八斛。壬出三百二十五斛，以四乘之，得一千三百斛；以五除之，得二百六十斛。

This problem involves distributing the transportation cost of rent (僦運直) among nine families based on their respective contributions of grain. Each family's contribution is adjusted by multiplying by 4 and dividing by 5. The total rent is 1000 hu, and the transportation cost is 200 hu. The goal is to determine how much each family contributes after the adjustment.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Contributions of each family in hu
contributions = {
    "甲": 35,
    "乙": 46,
    "丙": 57,
    "丁": 68,
    "戊": 79,
    "己": 80,
    "庚": 100,
    "辛": 210,
    "壬": 325
}

# Adjusted contributions after multiplying by 4 and dividing by 5
adjusted_contributions = {}
for family, amount in contributions.items():
    adjusted_contributions[family] = Fraction(4 * amount, 5)

# Total adjusted contributions
total_adjusted = sum(adjusted_contributions.values())

# Total rent and transportation cost
total_rent = 1000
transportation_cost = 200

# Total to be distributed
total_to_distribute = total_rent + transportation_cost

# Final contributions for each family
final_contributions = {}
for family, adjusted_amount in adjusted_contributions.items():
    final_contributions[family] = adjusted_amount / total_adjusted * total_to_distribute

# Output the results
for family, final_amount in final_contributions.items():
    print(f"{family} contributes {final_amount} hu.")
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Contributions**: Each family's initial contribution is stored in a dictionary.
2. **Adjust Contributions**: Each contribution is multiplied by 4 and divided by 5, as per the procedure.
3. **Total Adjusted Contributions**: The sum of all adjusted contributions is calculated.
4. **Distribute Total Rent and Transportation Cost**: The total rent (1000 hu) plus the transportation cost (200 hu) is distributed proportionally based on the adjusted contributions.
5. **Output Results**: The final contribution for each family is printed.

### Answer:
The final contributions for each family will be calculated and displayed in terms of hu. Each family's share is proportional to their adjusted contribution.
