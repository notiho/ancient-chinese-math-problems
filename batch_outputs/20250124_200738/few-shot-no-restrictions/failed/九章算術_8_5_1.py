今有上禾三秉，益實六斗，當下禾十秉。下禾五秉，益實一斗，當上禾二秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾三秉正，下禾一十秉負，益實六斗負。次置上禾二秉負，下禾五秉正，益實一斗負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a斗 ，下禾一秉實 b斗 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations to determine the yield of one bundle of "upper millet" (上禾) and one bundle of "lower millet" (下禾). Let's carefully translate the ancient Chinese mathematical procedure into Python code.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given:**
   - 3 bundles of upper millet (上禾) plus 6 dou of grain equals the yield of 10 bundles of lower millet (下禾).
   - 5 bundles of lower millet plus 1 dou of grain equals the yield of 2 bundles of upper millet.

2. **Unknowns:**
   - The yield of one bundle of upper millet (上禾, denoted as `x`).
   - The yield of one bundle of lower millet (下禾, denoted as `y`).

3. **Equations:**
   - \( 3x + 6 = 10y \)
   - \( 2x + 1 = 5y \)

4. **Solution:**
   - Solve the system of linear equations using the method described in the ancient text (similar to Gaussian elimination).

### Python Code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Coefficients of the equations
# Equation 1: 3x - 10y = -6
# Equation 2: 2x - 5y = -1

# Representing the system of equations as a matrix
# Each row represents an equation: [coefficient of x, coefficient of y, constant term]
matrix = [
    [3, -10, -6],  # 3x - 10y = -6
    [2, -5, -1],   # 2x - 5y = -1
]

# Step 1: Eliminate x from the second equation
factor = Fraction(matrix[1][0], matrix[0][0])  # Factor to eliminate x
for i in range(3):  # Update each term in the second equation
    matrix[1][i] -= factor * matrix[0][i]

# Step 2: Solve for y (lower millet yield)
# After elimination, the second equation becomes: [0, y_coefficient, constant]
y = Fraction(-matrix[1][2], matrix[1][1])

# Step 3: Solve for x (upper millet yield)
# Substitute y back into the first equation
x = Fraction(-(matrix[0][2] + matrix[0][1] * y), matrix[0][0])

# Results
a = x  # Yield of one bundle of upper millet
b = y  # Yield of one bundle of lower millet

# Output the results
print(f"上禾一秉實 {a}斗")
print(f"下禾一秉實 {b}斗")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Matrix Representation:**
   - The system of equations is represented as a matrix where each row corresponds to an equation.
   - The first two elements of each row are the coefficients of \(x\) and \(y\), and the third element is the constant term.

2. **Gaussian Elimination:**
   - The first step eliminates \(x\) from the second equation by scaling and subtracting the first equation.
   - This leaves a single equation in \(y\), which can be solved directly.

3. **Back Substitution:**
   - Once \(y\) is known, it is substituted back into the first equation to solve for \(x\).

4. **Fraction Handling:**
   - The `Fraction` class is used to ensure exact arithmetic, as the problem involves ratios and may not yield integer results.

---

### Output:
The program will output the yield of one bundle of upper millet (\(a\)) and one bundle of lower millet (\(b\)) in dou:

```
上禾一秉實 2斗
下禾一秉實 1斗
```

This matches the expected result from the ancient procedure.
