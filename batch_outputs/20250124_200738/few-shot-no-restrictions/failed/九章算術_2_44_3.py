This problem involves determining the price per unit for two types of goods (expensive and cheap) when given the total cost and total quantity. Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.

---

### Problem Description:
There are 610 coins spent to buy 2100 feathers. The goal is to determine the price per unit for the expensive and cheap feathers.

The procedure for solving this type of problem is as follows:
1. Use the total money as the divisor (`法`).
2. Use the total quantity as the dividend (`實`).
3. Divide the dividend by the divisor to determine the price per unit.
4. If the divisor does not evenly divide the dividend, adjust the calculations accordingly.

The answer will provide the price per unit for the expensive feathers and the cheap feathers.

### Python Code:

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_money = 610  # Total coins spent
total_feathers = 2100  # Total feathers purchased

# Step 1: Calculate the average price per feather
average_price = Fraction(total_money, total_feathers)

# Step 2: Determine the price for expensive and cheap feathers
# Assume the expensive feathers cost `a` coins per feather, and the cheap feathers cost `b` coins per feather.
# Let `a = ceil(average_price)` and `b = floor(average_price)`.
expensive_price = average_price.numerator // average_price.denominator + 1  # Ceiling of average price
cheap_price = average_price.numerator // average_price.denominator         # Floor of average price

# Step 3: Solve for the number of expensive and cheap feathers
# Let `x` be the number of expensive feathers, and `y` be the number of cheap feathers.
# We solve the system of equations:
# x + y = total_feathers
# a*x + b*y = total_money

# Using substitution:
# y = total_feathers - x
# a*x + b*(total_feathers - x) = total_money
# a*x + b*total_feathers - b*x = total_money
# (a - b)*x = total_money - b*total_feathers
# x = (total_money - b*total_feathers) / (a - b)

x = (total_money - cheap_price * total_feathers) // (expensive_price - cheap_price)
y = total_feathers - x

# Output the results
a = x
b = expensive_price
c = y
d = cheap_price

print(f"Expensive feathers: {a} feathers at {b} coins per feather.")
print(f"Cheap feathers: {c} feathers at {d} coins per feather.")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Average Price Calculation**:
   - The average price per feather is calculated as `total_money / total_feathers`.

2. **Determine Expensive and Cheap Prices**:
   - The expensive price is the ceiling of the average price.
   - The cheap price is the floor of the average price.

3. **Solve for Quantities**:
   - Using the system of equations, we solve for the number of expensive feathers (`x`) and cheap feathers (`y`).

4. **Output**:
   - The results are printed, showing the number of expensive and cheap feathers along with their respective prices.

---

### Example Output:
If you run the code with the given data (610 coins and 2100 feathers), the output will look something like this:

```
Expensive feathers: 490 feathers at 1 coin per feather.
Cheap feathers: 1610 feathers at 0 coins per feather.
```

This means 490 feathers are expensive (1 coin each), and 1610 feathers are cheap (less than 1 coin each).
