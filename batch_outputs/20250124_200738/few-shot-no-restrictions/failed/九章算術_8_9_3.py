今有甲乙二人持錢不知其數。甲得乙半而錢五十，乙得甲太半而亦錢五十。問︰甲、乙持錢各幾何？
術曰：如方程，損益之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：甲持 a錢 ，乙持 b錢 。

This is a classic problem involving a system of linear equations. The problem describes two people, A (甲) and B (乙), holding unknown amounts of money. The conditions are as follows:

1. If A takes half of B's money, A will have 50 units of money.
2. If B takes more than half of A's money (specifically, 3/2 of half of A's money), B will also have 50 units of money.

We need to determine how much money A and B each have. Let's solve this step by step using Python.

---

### Problem Restatement in Mathematical Terms:
Let:
- \( x \) = money held by A (甲)
- \( y \) = money held by B (乙)

From the problem:
1. \( x + \frac{y}{2} = 50 \)
2. \( y + \frac{3x}{4} = 50 \)

We solve this system of equations to find \( x \) and \( y \).

---

### Python Code Solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define variables for the money held by A (甲) and B (乙)
x, y = symbols('x y')

# Equation 1: A takes half of B's money
eq1 = Eq(x + y / 2, 50)

# Equation 2: B takes 3/4 of A's money
eq2 = Eq(y + (3 * x) / 4, 50)

# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))

# Extract the results
a = solution[x]
b = solution[y]

# Output the results
print(f"甲持 {a} 錢，乙持 {b} 錢。")
#----- content ends here -----


"""


---

### Explanation of the Code:
1. We use the `sympy` library to symbolically define the variables \( x \) and \( y \).
2. The two equations are defined based on the problem's conditions.
3. The `solve` function is used to solve the system of equations.
4. The solution is extracted and printed.

---

### Answer:
After running the code, the solution is:

- \( a = 40 \) (甲持 40 錢)
- \( b = 20 \) (乙持 20 錢)

Thus:
**甲持 40 錢，乙持 20 錢。**
