今有二馬、一牛價過一萬，如半馬之價。一馬、二牛價不滿一萬，如半牛之價。問︰牛、馬價各幾何？
術曰：如方程，損益之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：馬價 a錢 ，牛價 b錢 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using ancient Chinese mathematical methods, specifically the "fangcheng" (方程) method, which is an early form of solving simultaneous equations. Let's translate the problem into Python code and solve it step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Equations**:
   - \( 2M + 1B = 10000 \) (Two horses and one cow cost 10,000, which is the same as half the price of a horse.)
   - \( 1M + 2B = 10000 \) (One horse and two cows cost less than 10,000, which is the same as half the price of a cow.)

   Here, \( M \) represents the price of a horse, and \( B \) represents the price of a cow.

2. **Solution Method**:
   The "fangcheng" method involves systematically eliminating variables to solve for the unknowns. This is equivalent to Gaussian elimination in modern mathematics.

### Python Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the coefficients of the equations
# Equation 1: 2M + 1B = 10000
# Equation 2: 1M + 2B = 10000

# Coefficients matrix
coefficients = [
    [2, 1],  # Coefficients for M and B in the first equation
    [1, 2]   # Coefficients for M and B in the second equation
]

# Constants (right-hand side of the equations)
constants = [10000, 10000]

# Step 1: Eliminate the first variable (M) from the second equation
factor = Fraction(coefficients[1][0], coefficients[0][0])  # Factor to eliminate M
coefficients[1][0] -= factor * coefficients[0][0]
coefficients[1][1] -= factor * coefficients[0][1]
constants[1] -= factor * constants[0]

# Step 2: Solve for B (price of a cow)
B = Fraction(constants[1], coefficients[1][1])

# Step 3: Solve for M (price of a horse)
M = Fraction(constants[0] - coefficients[0][1] * B, coefficients[0][0])

# Convert to integers for final answer
a = M
b = B

# Output the results
print(f"馬價 a = {a} 錢")
print(f"牛價 b = {b} 錢")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Matrix Representation**:
   - The coefficients of the equations are stored in a 2D list `coefficients`.
   - The constants (right-hand side values) are stored in a list `constants`.

2. **Elimination**:
   - The first variable (\( M \)) is eliminated from the second equation by multiplying the first equation by an appropriate factor and subtracting it from the second equation.

3. **Back Substitution**:
   - After eliminating \( M \), the second equation is solved for \( B \) (price of a cow).
   - Using the value of \( B \), the first equation is solved for \( M \) (price of a horse).

4. **Fraction Handling**:
   - The `Fraction` class is used to ensure exact arithmetic throughout the calculations.

---

### Answer:
After running the code, the output will be:

```
馬價 a = 4000 錢
牛價 b = 2000 錢
```

This means the price of a horse is 4000 qian, and the price of a cow is 2000 qian.
