This problem involves dividing 576 units of money to purchase 78 bamboo items, where the bamboo items are of two different sizes (or qualities) with different prices. The goal is to determine how many of each type of bamboo are purchased and their respective prices.

The procedure involves proportional distribution based on the given rates.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Total Money:** 576 units.
2. **Total Bamboo:** 78 items.
3. **Rates:** The problem implies there are two types of bamboo with different prices, but the exact rates are not provided in the problem statement. Without specific rates, we cannot compute the exact solution.

If you provide the rates (e.g., the price per bamboo for each type), I can compute the solution. For now, I'll assume two rates: `x` and `y` (price per bamboo for the two types).

### Python Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Total money and total bamboo
total_money = 576
total_bamboo = 78

# Let x and y be the prices of the two types of bamboo
x, y = symbols('x y')

# Let a and c be the quantities of the two types of bamboo
a, c = symbols('a c')

# Equations based on the problem
eq1 = Eq(a + c, total_bamboo)  # Total bamboo
eq2 = Eq(a * x + c * y, total_money)  # Total money

# Solve for a and c in terms of x and y
solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (a, c))

# Display the solution

### Explanation of the Code:
1. `total_money` is the total amount of money spent.
2. `total_bamboo` is the total number of bamboo items purchased.
3. `x` and `y` are the prices of the two types of bamboo.
4. `a` and `c` are the quantities of the two types of bamboo.
5. The equations represent:
   - The total number of bamboo items (`a + c = 78`).
   - The total money spent (`a * x + c * y = 576`).
6. The `solve` function computes the values of `a` and `c` in terms of `x` and `y`.

---

### Next Steps:
If you provide the specific rates (e.g., `x = 8` and `y = 6`), I can substitute those values into the equations and compute the exact quantities and prices. Let me know!
