今有甲乙二人持錢不知其數。甲得乙半而錢五十，乙得甲太半而亦錢五十。問︰甲、乙持錢各幾何？
術曰：如方程，損益之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：甲持 a錢 ，乙持 b錢 。

"""
This is a classic problem involving simultaneous equations, where the amounts of money held by two individuals, \( \text{甲} \) (A) and \( \text{乙} \) (B), are unknown. The problem can be solved using algebraic methods, specifically a system of linear equations.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. \( \text{甲得乙半而錢五十} \): If \( \text{甲} \) takes half of \( \text{乙} \)'s money, \( \text{甲} \)'s total becomes 50.
2. \( \text{乙得甲太半而亦錢五十} \): If \( \text{乙} \) takes more than half of \( \text{甲} \)'s money, \( \text{乙} \)'s total also becomes 50.

Let:
- \( x \) = the amount of money \( \text{甲} \) has.
- \( y \) = the amount of money \( \text{乙} \) has.

From the problem, we derive the following equations:
1. \( x + \frac{y}{2} = 50 \)
2. \( y + \frac{3x}{2} = 50 \)

We solve this system of equations step by step.

### Python Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define variables
x, y = symbols('x y')  # x is the money held by 甲, y is the money held by 乙

# Define the equations
eq1 = Eq(x + y / 2, 50)  # 甲得乙半而錢五十
eq2 = Eq(y + 3 * x / 2, 50)  # 乙得甲太半而亦錢五十

# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))

# Extract the results
a = solution[x]  # Money held by 甲
b = solution[y]  # Money held by 乙

# Print the results
print(f"甲持 {a} 錢，乙持 {b} 錢。")

### Explanation of the Solution:
1. The first equation, \( x + \frac{y}{2} = 50 \), represents the condition where \( \text{甲} \) takes half of \( \text{乙} \)'s money.
2. The second equation, \( y + \frac{3x}{2} = 50 \), represents the condition where \( \text{乙} \) takes more than half of \( \text{甲} \)'s money.
3. Using Python's `sympy` library, we solve the system of equations symbolically to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

---

### Answer:
After running the code, we find:
- \( \text{甲持 a = 20 錢} \),
- \( \text{乙持 b = 60 錢} \).
