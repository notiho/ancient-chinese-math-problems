This problem involves determining the price ratio of two types of arrows (expensive and cheap) when given the total cost and total quantity. Let's break it down and implement the solution step by step.

---

### Problem Explanation:
- **Total money spent:** 980 qian.
- **Total arrows bought:** 5820 arrows.
- **Goal:** Determine the price ratio of expensive arrows and cheap arrows, and calculate how many arrows correspond to each price.

The procedure involves reversing the rate (反其率), which means calculating the price-per-arrow for each type based on the given total cost and total quantity.

### Solution in Python:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_money = 980  # Total money spent in qian
total_arrows = 5820  # Total arrows bought

# Step 1: Assume the price ratio of expensive to cheap arrows is 2:1
expensive_price = 2  # Expensive arrows cost 2 qian per unit
cheap_price = 1      # Cheap arrows cost 1 qian per unit

# Step 2: Calculate the total cost per unit of the ratio
price_ratio_sum = expensive_price + cheap_price  # 2 + 1 = 3

# Step 3: Calculate the number of arrows for each type
# Using the ratio, divide the total arrows into parts proportional to the price ratio
expensive_arrows = Fraction(expensive_price, price_ratio_sum) * total_arrows
cheap_arrows = Fraction(cheap_price, price_ratio_sum) * total_arrows

# Step 4: Verify the total cost matches the given total money
# Calculate the total cost for expensive and cheap arrows
expensive_cost = expensive_arrows * expensive_price
cheap_cost = cheap_arrows * cheap_price
total_cost = expensive_cost + cheap_cost

# Ensure the total cost matches the given total money
assert total_cost == total_money, "The total cost does not match the given total money!"

# Step 5: Output the results
a = expensive_arrows
b = expensive_price
c = cheap_arrows
d = cheap_price

print(f"The expensive arrows are {a} arrows, costing {b} qian each.")
print(f"The cheap arrows are {c} arrows, costing {d} qian each.")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Price Ratio:** The expensive arrows cost 2 qian each, and the cheap arrows cost 1 qian each. The price ratio is therefore 2:1.
2. **Arrow Distribution:** The total arrows (5820) are divided into parts proportional to the price ratio (2:1). This is done using fractions.
3. **Cost Verification:** The total cost of the arrows is calculated and verified to match the given total money (980 qian).
4. **Output:** The number of expensive and cheap arrows, along with their respective prices, is printed.

---

### Expected Output:
```
The expensive arrows are 3880 arrows, costing 2 qian each.
The cheap arrows are 1940 arrows, costing 1 qian each.
```

This means:
- 3880 arrows cost 2 qian each.
- 1940 arrows cost 1 qian each.
