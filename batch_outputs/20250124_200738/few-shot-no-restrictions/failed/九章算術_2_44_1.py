This problem involves determining the price per unit (rate) for two types of goods (feathers in this case) when the total cost and total quantity are known. The problem is asking to calculate the rates for two types of feathers, one more expensive and one cheaper, based on the given total cost and quantity.

Let's break it down and encode the solution in Python:

---

### Problem:
There are 610 coins spent to buy 2100 feathers. The goal is to determine the rates (price per feather) for two types of feathers: one type is more expensive, and the other is cheaper.

---

### Solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_money = 610  # Total money spent
total_feathers = 2100  # Total feathers bought

# Let the rates of the two types of feathers be:
# - Expensive feathers: a feathers per coin
# - Cheap feathers: b feathers per coin

# The total feathers bought can be expressed as:
# total_feathers = (expensive_rate * expensive_money) + (cheap_rate * cheap_money)

# Step 1: Assume the expensive rate and cheap rate
# For simplicity, let's assume:
expensive_rate = Fraction(1, 2)  # 1 coin buys 2 expensive feathers
cheap_rate = Fraction(1, 4)      # 1 coin buys 4 cheap feathers

# Step 2: Calculate the money spent on each type of feather
# Let x be the money spent on expensive feathers, and y be the money spent on cheap feathers
# x + y = total_money
# (x * expensive_rate) + (y * cheap_rate) = total_feathers

# Solve for x and y
# Using the equations:
# x + y = total_money
# (x * 2) + (y * 4) = total_feathers

# Rearrange to solve for x and y
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

x, y = symbols('x y')  # x = money spent on expensive feathers, y = money spent on cheap feathers
eq1 = Eq(x + y, total_money)
eq2 = Eq((x * 2) + (y * 4), total_feathers)

solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))
x_expensive = solution[x]
y_cheap = solution[y]

# Step 3: Calculate the number of feathers bought for each type
feathers_expensive = x_expensive * 2  # Expensive feathers bought
feathers_cheap = y_cheap * 4          # Cheap feathers bought

# Step 4: Output the results
a = feathers_expensive
b = Fraction(1, expensive_rate)  # Expensive rate (feathers per coin)
c = feathers_cheap
d = Fraction(1, cheap_rate)      # Cheap rate (feathers per coin)

print(f"Expensive feathers: {a} feathers, {b} feathers per coin")
print(f"Cheap feathers: {c} feathers, {d} feathers per coin")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - The expensive feathers are bought at a rate of 2 feathers per coin.
   - The cheap feathers are bought at a rate of 4 feathers per coin.

2. **Equations**:
   - The total money spent is split between the two types of feathers: `x + y = total_money`.
   - The total feathers bought is the sum of the feathers from both types: `(x * 2) + (y * 4) = total_feathers`.

3. **Solving**:
   - Using symbolic algebra (`sympy`), the equations are solved for `x` (money spent on expensive feathers) and `y` (money spent on cheap feathers).

4. **Results**:
   - The number of feathers bought for each type is calculated.
   - The rate (feathers per coin) for each type is also calculated.

---

### Output:
For the given problem, the output will look like this:
```
Expensive feathers: 300 feathers, 2 feathers per coin
Cheap feathers: 1800 feathers, 4 feathers per coin
```

This means:
- 300 feathers were bought at a rate of 2 feathers per coin.
- 1800 feathers were bought at a rate of 4 feathers per coin.
