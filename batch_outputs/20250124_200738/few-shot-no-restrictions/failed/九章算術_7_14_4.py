今有漆三得油四，油四和漆五。今有漆三斗，欲令分以易油，還自和餘漆。問︰出漆、得油、和漆各幾何？
術曰：假令出漆九升，不足六升。令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。

This problem involves a proportional exchange of lacquer (漆) and oil (油), followed by mixing the remaining lacquer with the obtained oil. Let's solve it step by step using the given procedure.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Exchange Rates**:
   - 3 dou of lacquer (漆) can be exchanged for 4 dou of oil (油).
   - 4 dou of oil can be mixed with 5 dou of lacquer.

2. **Given**:
   - There are 3 dou of lacquer (漆) available.
   - We want to exchange lacquer for oil, then mix the remaining lacquer with the obtained oil.

3. **Question**:
   - How much lacquer is exchanged (出漆)?
   - How much oil is obtained (得油)?
   - How much lacquer and oil are mixed together (和漆)?

---

### Procedure:
The procedure involves proportional reasoning and the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method). Here's how we solve it step by step:

---

### Step 1: Define the exchange rate for lacquer to oil
- 3 dou of lacquer → 4 dou of oil.
- Therefore, the exchange rate is:
  \[
  \text{Rate of lacquer to oil} = \frac{4}{3}
  \]

---

### Step 2: Define the mixing ratio of oil and lacquer
- 4 dou of oil → 5 dou of lacquer.
- Therefore, the mixing ratio is:
  \[
  \text{Mixing ratio (oil to lacquer)} = \frac{5}{4}
  \]

---

### Step 3: Solve for the amount of lacquer exchanged (出漆)
- Let \( x \) be the amount of lacquer exchanged (in dou).
- The amount of oil obtained is proportional to the exchange rate:
  \[
  \text{Oil obtained} = \frac{4}{3} \cdot x
  \]
- The remaining lacquer after exchange is:
  \[
  \text{Remaining lacquer} = 3 - x
  \]
- The total lacquer and oil mixed together must satisfy the mixing ratio:
  \[
  \frac{\text{Oil obtained}}{\text{Remaining lacquer}} = \frac{4}{5}
  \]
  Substituting the expressions for oil obtained and remaining lacquer:
  \[
  \frac{\frac{4}{3} \cdot x}{3 - x} = \frac{4}{5}
  \]

---

### Step 4: Solve the equation
Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:
\[
5 \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot x = 4 \cdot (3 - x)
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{20}{3} \cdot x = 12 - 4x
\]
Multiply through by 3 to eliminate the denominator:
\[
20x = 36 - 12x
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
32x = 36
\]
Solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{36}{32} = \frac{9}{8} \, \text{dou}
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the results
1. **Lacquer exchanged (出漆)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{8} \, \text{dou} = 1 \, \text{dou and } 1 \, \text{sheng (since 1 dou = 10 sheng)}.
   \]

2. **Oil obtained (得油)**:
   Using the exchange rate:
   \[
   \text{Oil obtained} = \frac{4}{3} \cdot x = \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{9}{8} = \frac{36}{24} = \frac{3}{2} \, \text{dou} = 1 \, \text{dou and } 5 \, \text{sheng}.
   \]

3. **Lacquer and oil mixed (和漆)**:
   - Remaining lacquer:
     \[
     \text{Remaining lacquer} = 3 - x = 3 - \frac{9}{8} = \frac{24}{8} - \frac{9}{8} = \frac{15}{8} \, \text{dou} = 1 \, \text{dou and } 7 \, \text{sheng}.
     \]
   - Total lacquer and oil mixed:
     \[
     \text{Mixed lacquer and oil} = \text{Remaining lacquer} + \text{Oil obtained}.
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Mixed lacquer and oil} = \frac{15}{8} + \frac{12}{8} = \frac{27}{8} \, \text{dou} = 3 \, \text{dou and } 3 \, \text{sheng}.
     \]

---

### Final Answer:
- 出漆 (Lacquer exchanged): \( a = 1 \, \text{dou and } 1 \, \text{sheng} \).
- 得油 (Oil obtained): \( b = 1 \, \text{dou and } 5 \, \text{sheng} \).
- 和漆 (Mixed lacquer and oil): \( c = 3 \, \text{dou and } 3 \, \text{sheng} \).#----- content ends here -----
