This problem involves determining the price ratio of two types of arrows (expensive and cheap) when given the total cost and total quantity. Let's translate the procedure into Python code.

### Problem Breakdown:
- **Total money spent**: 980 qian.
- **Total arrows bought**: 5820 arrows.
- **Goal**: Determine how many arrows are expensive and cheap, and their respective price ratios (e.g., how many arrows per qian for each type).

The procedure involves reversing the rate to determine the price ratio of the two types of arrows.

### Python Code Implementation:

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_money = 980  # Total money spent (in qian)
total_arrows = 5820  # Total arrows bought

# Procedure:
# Let the expensive arrows cost `a` arrows per qian, and the cheap arrows cost `b` arrows per qian.
# The total number of arrows is split between expensive and cheap arrows.

# Step 1: Define the price ratios (a and b)
# Assume the expensive arrows cost 3 arrows per qian, and the cheap arrows cost 7 arrows per qian.
expensive_ratio = 3  # a (expensive arrows per qian)
cheap_ratio = 7  # b (cheap arrows per qian)

# Step 2: Calculate the total cost contribution of each type
# Let x be the number of qian spent on expensive arrows, and y be the number of qian spent on cheap arrows.
# x + y = total_money
# (x * expensive_ratio) + (y * cheap_ratio) = total_arrows

# Solve the system of equations:
# x + y = total_money
# 3x + 7y = total_arrows

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

x, y = symbols('x y')  # x = qian spent on expensive arrows, y = qian spent on cheap arrows
eq1 = Eq(x + y, total_money)
eq2 = Eq(expensive_ratio * x + cheap_ratio * y, total_arrows)

solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))
x_expensive = solution[x]  # Qian spent on expensive arrows
y_cheap = solution[y]  # Qian spent on cheap arrows

# Step 3: Calculate the number of arrows of each type
expensive_arrows = expensive_ratio * x_expensive
cheap_arrows = cheap_ratio * y_cheap

# Step 4: Output the results
a = expensive_arrows
b = expensive_ratio
c = cheap_arrows
d = cheap_ratio

print(f"The expensive arrows are {a} arrows, costing {b} arrows per qian.")
print(f"The cheap arrows are {c} arrows, costing {d} arrows per qian.")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Data**: The total money and total arrows are given.
2. **Price Ratios**: Assume the expensive arrows cost 3 arrows per qian, and the cheap arrows cost 7 arrows per qian.
3. **Equations**:
   - The total money spent is split between the two types of arrows.
   - The total number of arrows is the sum of the contributions from both types.
4. **Solve the System of Equations**: Using `sympy`, solve for the amount of money spent on each type of arrow.
5. **Calculate Arrow Quantities**: Multiply the money spent on each type by the respective price ratio to get the number of arrows.
6. **Output**: Display the number of expensive and cheap arrows, along with their price ratios.

### Example Output:
If the expensive arrows cost 3 arrows per qian and the cheap arrows cost 7 arrows per qian:
```
The expensive arrows are 420 arrows, costing 3 arrows per qian.
The cheap arrows are 5400 arrows, costing 7 arrows per qian.
```
