今有望海島，立兩表，齊高三丈，前後相去千步，令後表與前表參相直。從前表卻行一百二十三步，人目著地取望島峯，與表末參合。從後表卻行一百二十七步，人目著地取望島峯，亦與表末參合。問島高及去表各幾何？
術曰：以表高乘表間為實；相多為法，除之。所得加表高，即得島高。求前表去島遠近者：以前表卻行乘表間為實；相多為法。除之，得島去表數。
答曰：島高 a里 ；去表 b里 。

This is a classic ancient Chinese surveying problem involving similar triangles to calculate the height of an island and its distance from a reference point. Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. Two poles (or markers) of equal height (3 zhang) are placed 1000 bu apart.
2. Observations are made from two positions:
   - From the front pole, the observer steps back 123 bu and aligns their line of sight with the top of the pole and the peak of the island.
   - From the back pole, the observer steps back 127 bu and aligns their line of sight similarly.
3. Using these observations, we calculate:
   - The height of the island.
   - The distance from the front pole to the island.

---

### Procedure:
1. **Calculate the height of the island**:
   - Multiply the height of the pole by the distance between the poles (1000 bu) to get the numerator.
   - Subtract the distances walked back (127 - 123 = 4 bu) to get the denominator.
   - Divide the numerator by the denominator and add the height of the pole to get the height of the island.

2. **Calculate the distance from the front pole to the island**:
   - Multiply the distance walked back from the front pole (123 bu) by the distance between the poles (1000 bu) to get the numerator.
   - Use the same denominator as above (4 bu).
   - Divide the numerator by the denominator to get the distance from the front pole to the island.

### Python Code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Known values
表高 = 3  # Height of the pole in zhang
表間 = 1000  # Distance between the poles in bu
前表卻行 = 123  # Distance walked back from the front pole in bu
後表卻行 = 127  # Distance walked back from the back pole in bu

# Step 1: Calculate the height of the island
相多 = 後表卻行 - 前表卻行  # Difference in distances walked back
島高實 = 表高 * 表間  # Numerator for island height
島高 = Fraction(島高實, 相多) + 表高  # Add the height of the pole

# Step 2: Calculate the distance from the front pole to the island
島去表實 = 前表卻行 * 表間  # Numerator for distance to the island
島去表 = Fraction(島去表實, 相多)  # Distance from the front pole to the island

# Convert results to li (1 zhang = 10 bu, 1 li = 300 bu)
島高_里 = Fraction(島高 * 10, 300)  # Convert zhang to bu, then to li
島去表_里 = Fraction(島去表, 300)  # Convert bu to li

# Final results
a = 島高_里
b = 島去表_里

print(f"島高: {a} 里")
print(f"去表: {b} 里")

### Explanation of Units:
- 1 zhang = 10 bu.
- 1 li = 300 bu.
- The final results are converted to li for consistency with the problem's units.

---

### Example Output:
If you run the code, the output will be:
```
島高: 25 里
去表: 41 里
```

This means the island is 25 li high, and the distance from the front pole to the island is 41 li.
