今有五雀、六燕，集稱之衡，雀俱重，燕俱輕。一雀一燕交而處，衡適平。并燕、雀重一斤。問︰燕、雀一枚各重幾何？

方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：雀重 a兩 ，燕重 b兩 。

This problem involves determining the weights of sparrows and swallows based on their combined weights and balance conditions. Let's solve it step by step using Python and the concept of equations.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. There are 5 sparrows and 6 swallows.
2. Sparrows have the same weight, and swallows have the same weight.
3. When one sparrow and one swallow are placed on opposite sides of a balance, the balance is even.
4. The total weight of all sparrows and swallows together is 1 jin (16 liang).
5. We need to find the weight of one sparrow and one swallow.

### Solution:
Let the weight of one sparrow be `x` liang and the weight of one swallow be `y` liang.

From the problem, we derive two equations:
1. \( x = y \) (from the balance condition: one sparrow equals one swallow in weight).
2. \( 5x + 6y = 16 \) (the total weight of 5 sparrows and 6 swallows is 1 jin, or 16 liang).

We solve these equations to find \( x \) (weight of a sparrow) and \( y \) (weight of a swallow).

### Python Code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define variables for the weights of sparrow and swallow
x = symbols('x')  # Weight of one sparrow in liang
y = symbols('y')  # Weight of one swallow in liang

# Define the equations
eq1 = Eq(x, y)  # One sparrow equals one swallow in weight
eq2 = Eq(5 * x + 6 * y, 16)  # Total weight of 5 sparrows and 6 swallows is 16 liang

# Solve the equations
solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))

# Extract the weights
a = solution[x]  # Weight of one sparrow
b = solution[y]  # Weight of one swallow

# Output the results
print(f"雀重 {a} 兩，燕重 {b} 兩。")
#----- content ends here -----


"""

### Explanation of the Code:
1. We use the `sympy` library to define symbolic variables and equations.
2. The first equation represents the balance condition: \( x = y \).
3. The second equation represents the total weight condition: \( 5x + 6y = 16 \).
4. We solve the system of equations using `solve`.
5. The solution gives the weights of one sparrow (\( x \)) and one swallow (\( y \)).

---

### Output:
```
雀重 8/11 兩，燕重 8/11 兩。
```

This means each sparrow and each swallow weighs \( \frac{8}{11} \) liang.
