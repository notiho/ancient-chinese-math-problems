This is a classic problem involving proportional reasoning and weighted averages. Let's translate the problem and solution into Python code step by step.

---

### Problem:
There are 9 pieces of gold and 11 pieces of silver, and their total weights are equal. If one piece of gold is traded for one piece of silver, the gold becomes lighter by 13 liang. The question is: how much does one piece of gold and one piece of silver weigh?

---

### Solution:
The procedure involves setting up a system of equations based on the given conditions and solving for the weights of gold and silver. Here's the Python implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
金枚數 = 9  # Number of gold pieces
銀枚數 = 11  # Number of silver pieces
金輕差 = 13  # Difference in weight when one gold is traded for one silver (in liang)

# Step 1: Define the weights of one piece of gold and one piece of silver
# Let the weight of one gold piece be x (in jin)
# Let the weight of one silver piece be y (in jin)

# Step 2: Set up the equations
# Equation 1: Total weight of gold = Total weight of silver
# 9x = 11y

# Equation 2: After trading one piece, gold becomes lighter by 13 liang (13/16 jin)
# 8x + y = 11y - 13/16

# Step 3: Solve the equations
# From Equation 1: x = (11/9)y
# Substitute x into Equation 2:
# 8(11/9)y + y = 11y - 13/16
# Simplify:
# (88/9)y + y = 11y - 13/16
# Combine terms:
# (88/9)y + (9/9)y = 11y - 13/16
# (97/9)y = 11y - 13/16
# Convert 11y to a fraction with denominator 9:
# (97/9)y = (99/9)y - 13/16
# Subtract (97/9)y from both sides:
# 0 = (2/9)y - 13/16
# Solve for y:
# (2/9)y = 13/16
# y = (13/16) * (9/2)
y = Fraction(13, 16) * Fraction(9, 2)

# Step 4: Solve for x using x = (11/9)y
x = Fraction(11, 9) * y

# Step 5: Output the results
a = x  # Weight of one gold piece in jin
b = y  # Weight of one silver piece in jin

print(f"金重 {a} 斤 ，銀重 {b} 斤 。")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Define Variables**: The number of gold and silver pieces, and the weight difference when one is traded.
2. **Set Up Equations**: Use the given conditions to create two equations:
   - Total weight equality: `9x = 11y`
   - Weight difference after trading: `8x + y = 11y - 13/16`
3. **Solve the Equations**: Substitute and simplify to solve for `x` (weight of gold) and `y` (weight of silver).
4. **Output the Results**: The weights are expressed as fractions for precision.

---

### Answer:
The weights of one piece of gold and one piece of silver are calculated as fractions of a jin. The output will look like this:

```
金重 13/16 斤 ，銀重 39/64 斤 。
```

This means:
- Each gold piece weighs **13/16 jin**.
- Each silver piece weighs **39/64 jin**.
