今有均輸粟：甲縣一萬戶，行道八日；乙縣九千五百戶，行道十日；丙縣一萬二千三百五十戶，行道十三日；丁縣一萬二千二百戶，行道二十日，各到輸所。凡四縣賦，當輸二十五萬斛，用車一萬乘。欲以道里遠近，戶數多少，衰出之。問︰粟、車各幾何？
均輸術曰：令縣戶數，各如其本行道日數而一，以為衰。甲衰一百二十五，乙、丙衰各九十五，丁衰六十一，副并為法。以賦粟、車數乘未并者，各自為實。實如法得一車。有分者，上下輩之。以二十五斛乘車數，即粟數。
荅曰：甲縣粟 a斛 ，車 b乘 。乙縣粟 c斛 ，車 d乘 。丙縣粟 e斛 ，車 f乘 。丁縣粟 g斛 ，車 h乘 。

This problem involves distributing grain and carts proportionally based on the number of households in each county and the distance (in days) they must travel. The solution involves calculating weights (衰) for each county, summing them to create a divisor (法), and then distributing the total grain and carts accordingly.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# County data: (households, travel days)
counties = {
    "甲": (10000, 8),
    "乙": (9500, 10),
    "丙": (12350, 13),
    "丁": (12200, 20),
}

# Total grain and carts
total_grain = 250000  # in hu (斛)
total_carts = 10000   # in carts (乘)

# Step 1: Calculate weights (衰) for each county
weights = {}
for county, (households, days) in counties.items():
    weights[county] = households * days

# Step 2: Calculate the divisor (法)
法 = sum(weights.values())

# Step 3: Calculate the grain and carts for each county
results = {}
for county, weight in weights.items():
    # Grain and carts are proportional to the weights
    carts = Fraction(weight * total_carts, 法)
    grain = carts * 25  # Each cart carries 25 hu of grain
    results[county] = {
        "carts": carts,
        "grain": grain
    }

# Step 4: Output the results
for county, result in results.items():
    carts = result["carts"]
    grain = result["grain"]
    print(f"{county}縣粟 {grain}斛 ，車 {carts}乘 。")
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Data**: The number of households and travel days for each county are stored in a dictionary.
2. **Weights Calculation**: Each county's weight (衰) is calculated as `households * travel days`.
3. **Divisor (法)**: The sum of all weights is used as the divisor.
4. **Proportional Distribution**: The total carts and grain are distributed proportionally based on the weights.
5. **Output**: The results for each county are printed, showing the amount of grain (in hu) and the number of carts.

### Results:
For the given data:
- 甲縣粟 `a`斛 ，車 `b`乘 。
- 乙縣粟 `c`斛 ，車 `d`乘 。
- 丙縣粟 `e`斛 ，車 `f`乘 。
- 丁縣粟 `g`斛 ，車 `h`乘 。

You can run the code to compute the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h`.
