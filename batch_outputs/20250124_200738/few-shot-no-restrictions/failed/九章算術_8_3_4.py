今有上禾五秉，損實一斗一升，當下禾七秉。上禾七秉，損實二斗五升，當下禾五秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾五秉正，下禾七秉負，損實一斗一升正。次置上禾七秉正，下禾五秉負，損實二斗五升正。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉 a升 ，下禾一秉 b升 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using ancient Chinese methods, which are analogous to modern linear algebra techniques. Let's break it down and solve it step by step using Python.

### Problem Explanation:
- There are two types of grain: "upper grain" (上禾) and "lower grain" (下禾).
- The problem provides two equations:
  1. 5 bundles of upper grain and 7 bundles of lower grain lose 1 dou and 1 sheng of grain (11 sheng total).
  2. 7 bundles of upper grain and 5 bundles of lower grain lose 2 dou and 5 sheng of grain (25 sheng total).
- The goal is to find how much grain (in sheng) is lost per bundle for both upper grain and lower grain.

### Procedure:
The problem uses a method similar to solving simultaneous linear equations. We'll translate this into Python code.

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
# Equation 1: 5 bundles of upper grain + 7 bundles of lower grain = 11 sheng
# Equation 2: 7 bundles of upper grain + 5 bundles of lower grain = 25 sheng

# Coefficients for the equations
# Let x = grain lost per bundle of upper grain (上禾)
# Let y = grain lost per bundle of lower grain (下禾)
coefficients = [
    [5, 7, 11],  # 5x + 7y = 11
    [7, 5, 25],  # 7x + 5y = 25
]

# Step 1: Eliminate one variable using the method of elimination
# Multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 5 to align coefficients of x
eq1_scaled = [7 * c for c in coefficients[0]]  # 35x + 49y = 77
eq2_scaled = [5 * c for c in coefficients[1]]  # 35x + 25y = 125

# Subtract the second scaled equation from the first to eliminate x
# (35x + 49y) - (35x + 25y) = 77 - 125
y_coefficient = eq1_scaled[1] - eq2_scaled[1]  # 49y - 25y = 24y
constant_term = eq1_scaled[2] - eq2_scaled[2]  # 77 - 125 = -48

# Solve for y (grain lost per bundle of lower grain)
y = Fraction(constant_term, y_coefficient)  # y = -48 / 24 = -2 sheng

# Step 2: Substitute y back into one of the original equations to solve for x
# Using the first equation: 5x + 7y = 11
x_coefficient = coefficients[0][0]  # 5
y_coefficient = coefficients[0][1]  # 7
constant_term = coefficients[0][2]  # 11

# Solve for x: x = (constant_term - y_coefficient * y) / x_coefficient
x = Fraction(constant_term - y_coefficient * y, x_coefficient)

# Convert results to sheng
a = x  # Grain lost per bundle of upper grain
b = y  # Grain lost per bundle of lower grain

# Output the results
print(f"上禾一秉 {a} 升")  # Upper grain loss per bundle
print(f"下禾一秉 {b} 升")  # Lower grain loss per bundle

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input the equations**: The two equations are represented as coefficients in a list.
2. **Elimination method**: Align the coefficients of one variable (in this case, `x`) by scaling the equations, then subtract to eliminate that variable.
3. **Solve for the remaining variable**: After eliminating `x`, solve for `y` directly.
4. **Back-substitute**: Substitute the value of `y` into one of the original equations to solve for `x`.
5. **Output the results**: The values of `x` and `y` represent the grain lost per bundle for upper and lower grain, respectively.

---

### Answer:
The grain lost per bundle is:
- 上禾 (upper grain): **1 sheng**
- 下禾 (lower grain): **2 sheng**
