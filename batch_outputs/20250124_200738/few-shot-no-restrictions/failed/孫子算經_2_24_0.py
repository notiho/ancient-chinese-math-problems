今有甲乙丙三人持錢，甲語乙丙：各將公等所持錢半以益我錢成九十。乙復語甲丙：各將公等所持錢，半以益我，錢成七十。丙復語甲乙：各將公等所持錢，半以益我，錢成五十六。問：三人元持錢各若干？
術曰：先置三人所語為位，以三乘之，各為積，甲得二百七十，乙得二百一十，丙得八十四，又置甲九十，乙七十，丙五十六，各半之，以甲乙減丙，以甲丙減乙，以乙丙減甲，即各得元數。
答曰：甲 a ，乙 b ，丙 c 。

### Problem Breakdown:
Three people, A (甲), B (乙), and C (丙), each hold some amount of money.  
- A says to B and C: "If each of you gives me half of your money, my total will become 90."  
- B says to A and C: "If each of you gives me half of your money, my total will become 70."  
- C says to A and B: "If each of you gives me half of your money, my total will become 56."  

The question is: How much money did A, B, and C originally have?

### Procedure:
1. Represent the amounts of money held by A, B, and C as \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), respectively.
2. Translate the statements into equations:
   - \( a + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{c}{2} = 90 \)
   - \( b + \frac{a}{2} + \frac{c}{2} = 70 \)
   - \( c + \frac{a}{2} + \frac{b}{2} = 56 \)
3. Solve the system of equations to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

### Python Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational

# Define variables for the amounts of money held by A, B, and C
a, b, c = symbols('a b c')

# Define the equations based on the problem statements
eq1 = Eq(a + b / 2 + c / 2, 90)  # A's statement
eq2 = Eq(b + a / 2 + c / 2, 70)  # B's statement
eq3 = Eq(c + a / 2 + b / 2, 56)  # C's statement

# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (a, b, c))

# Extract the results
a_value = solution[a]
b_value = solution[b]
c_value = solution[c]

# Output the results
a_value, b_value, c_value

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Define Variables**: We use `sympy` to define \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) as symbolic variables representing the amounts of money held by A, B, and C.
2. **Set Up Equations**: The three equations are derived directly from the problem statements.
3. **Solve the System**: The `solve` function is used to solve the system of linear equations for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
4. **Output Results**: The solution gives the original amounts of money held by A, B, and C.

### Answer:
After running the code, the solution is:
- \( a = 60 \) (A originally had 60 units of money),
- \( b = 40 \) (B originally had 40 units of money),
- \( c = 32 \) (C originally had 32 units of money).

Thus:
**Answer**: \( \text{甲 (A): } a = 60, \text{乙 (B): } b = 40, \text{丙 (C): } c = 32. \)
