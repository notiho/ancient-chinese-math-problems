### Explanation of the Algorithm:
1. **Initial Guess (`借算`)**:
   - Start with an initial guess for the square root by incrementing until the square of the guess exceeds the given area.

2. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Subtract the square of the guess from the area to get the remainder (`餘`).
   - Double the current guess to form the divisor (`定法`).
   - Find the next digit of the square root by trial and error, ensuring that the product of the divisor and the digit does not exceed the remainder.

3. **Final Result**:
   - Combine the digits of the square root to form the final result.
   - If the square root cannot be extracted exactly, the algorithm provides the result in fractional form.

---

### Example Output:
For an area of 25,281 bu, the side length of the square field is approximately:

```
荅曰：159步。
```

This implementation follows the ancient Chinese algorithm for square root extraction while using modern Python constructs for clarity.
