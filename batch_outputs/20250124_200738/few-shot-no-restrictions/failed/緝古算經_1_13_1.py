假令有粟二萬六千三百四十二石四斗，欲作方窖六、圓窖四，令口小底大，方面與圓徑等，其深亦同，令深少於下方七尺，多於上方一丈四尺，盛各滿中而粟適盡。問上下方、深數各多少？
術曰：以四十二乘斛法，以乘粟，三百八十四而一，為方亭積尺。令方差自乘，三而一，為隅陽冪。以多乘之，以減積，余為實。以多乘差，加冪，為方法。又以多加差，為廉法，從。開立方除之，即上方。加差，即合所問。
答曰：方窖上方 a尺 ，下方 b丈 ，深 c丈 ，圓窖上下徑深與方窖同。

This is a complex ancient Chinese mathematical problem involving the calculation of the dimensions of square and circular granaries based on a given volume of grain. The problem involves cubic equations and iterative methods to solve for the dimensions. Below is the Python implementation of the procedure described in the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Data**:
   - Total grain: 26,342 石 4 斗.
   - 1 石 = 10 斗.
   - There are 6 square granaries and 4 circular granaries.
   - The square granaries and circular granaries have the same depth.
   - The depth is 7 尺 less than the bottom side and 1 丈 4 尺 more than the top side.
   - The grain is evenly distributed, and the total volume is used up.

2. **Procedure**:
   - Use the formula for the volume of a square granary and a circular granary.
   - Solve for the top side, bottom side, and depth using the relationships provided.

3. **Answer**:
   - The dimensions of the square granary (top side, bottom side, depth).
   - The circular granary has the same dimensions.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Conversion**:
   - The total grain is converted into cubic chi using the given conversion factor (42斛法 and 384 cubic chi per 石).

2. **Equations**:
   - The relationships between the top side, bottom side, and depth are encoded as equations.
   - The volume formulas for square and circular granaries are used to calculate the total volume.

3. **Solution**:
   - The `sympy` library is used to solve the system of equations for the dimensions of the granaries.

4. **Output**:
   - The dimensions of the square granary are printed.
   - Since the circular granary has the same dimensions, it is stated explicitly.

### Note:
This problem involves solving a cubic equation, which may have multiple solutions. The correct solution must be chosen based on the context (e.g., positive dimensions). The implementation assumes the use of symbolic computation for accuracy.
