今有上禾三秉，益實六斗，當下禾十秉。下禾五秉，益實一斗，當上禾二秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾三秉正，下禾一十秉負，益實六斗負。次置上禾二秉負，下禾五秉正，益實一斗負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a斗 ，下禾一秉實 b斗 。

This is a classic ancient Chinese problem involving a system of linear equations. The problem can be solved using the method described in the text, which is essentially Gaussian elimination. Let's break it down step by step and implement it in Python.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given:**
   - 3 bundles of upper millet (上禾) plus 6 dou of grain equals 10 bundles of lower millet (下禾).
   - 5 bundles of lower millet plus 1 dou of grain equals 2 bundles of upper millet.

2. **Goal:**
   - Find the grain (实) per bundle for both upper millet (上禾) and lower millet (下禾).

3. **Method:**
   - Represent the problem as a system of linear equations:
     - \( 3x - 10y = -6 \)
     - \( -2x + 5y = -1 \)
     Where:
     - \( x \) is the grain per bundle of upper millet (上禾).
     - \( y \) is the grain per bundle of lower millet (下禾).
   - Solve the system using elimination or substitution.

### Python Implementation:

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Coefficients of the equations
# Equation 1: 3x - 10y = -6
a1, b1, c1 = 3, -10, -6

# Equation 2: -2x + 5y = -1
a2, b2, c2 = -2, 5, -1

# Step 1: Eliminate x by multiplying the equations to align coefficients of x
# Multiply Equation 1 by 2 and Equation 2 by 3
a1, b1, c1 = 2 * a1, 2 * b1, 2 * c1  # 6x - 20y = -12
a2, b2, c2 = 3 * a2, 3 * b2, 3 * c2  # -6x + 15y = -3

# Step 2: Add the two equations to eliminate x
# (6x - 20y) + (-6x + 15y) = -12 + (-3)
b = b1 + b2  # Coefficient of y
c = c1 + c2  # Constant term
# Resulting equation: -5y = -15
y = Fraction(-c, b)  # y = 3

# Step 3: Substitute y back into one of the original equations to solve for x
# Using Equation 1: 3x - 10y = -6
x = Fraction(c1 - b1 * y, a1)  # x = 2

# Results
a = x  # Grain per bundle of upper millet (上禾)
b = y  # Grain per bundle of lower millet (下禾)

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input the equations:** The coefficients of the two equations are input as variables.
2. **Eliminate one variable:** The equations are manipulated to eliminate \( x \), leaving a single equation in terms of \( y \).
3. **Solve for \( y \):** The resulting equation is solved for \( y \) using basic algebra.
4. **Substitute \( y \) back:** The value of \( y \) is substituted into one of the original equations to solve for \( x \).
5. **Output the results:** The values of \( x \) and \( y \) are printed as the grain per bundle for upper and lower millet.

---

### Answer:
The grain per bundle is:
- \( a = 2 \) dou for upper millet (上禾).
- \( b = 3 \) dou for lower millet (下禾).
