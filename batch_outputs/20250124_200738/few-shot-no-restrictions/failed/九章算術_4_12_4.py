This problem describes the ancient Chinese method of square root extraction, specifically for determining the side length of a square field given its area. The procedure is quite detailed and involves iterative steps to approximate the square root. Below is the Python implementation of this method.

### Problem Description:
Given an area of 25,281 bu (步), determine the side length of the square field.

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The total area (`積`) is given as 25,281 bu.
   - Start with an initial guess (`借算`) of 1 for the side length.

2. **Iterative Approximation**:
   - The algorithm iteratively refines the guess for the side length by increasing its order of magnitude (`超一等`) and checking if the square of the guess exceeds the total area.

3. **Refinement**:
   - Once the approximate side length is determined, the algorithm refines it further by doubling the divisor (`倍法為定法`) and subtracting the square of the guess from the area (`折法而下`).

4. **Exact or Fractional Result**:
   - If the remainder is zero, the exact square root is found.
   - If the remainder is negative, the square root cannot be extracted exactly, and the result is returned as a fraction.

5. **Output**:
   - The final side length (`a`) is printed in bu.

---

### Example Output:
For an area of 25,281 bu, the side length of the square field is approximately:

```
荅曰：159步。
```

This implementation follows the ancient Chinese method of square root extraction while leveraging Python's `Fraction` class for precise calculations.
