今有塹上廣一丈六尺三寸，下廣一丈，深六尺三寸，袤一十三丈二尺一寸。問︰積幾何？
荅曰：一萬九百四十三尺八寸。
夏程人功八百七十一尺。并出土功五分之一，沙礫水石之功作太半，定功二百三十二尺、一十五分尺之四。問︰用徒幾何？
術曰：置本人功，去其出土功五分之一，又去沙礫水石之功太半，餘為法。以塹積尺為實。實如法而一，即用徒人數。
荅曰： a人 。

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Volume Calculation**:
   - The trench has:
     - Top width: 1 zhang 6 chi 3 cun (16.3 chi)
     - Bottom width: 1 zhang (10 chi)
     - Depth: 6 chi 3 cun (6.3 chi)
     - Length: 13 zhang 2 chi 1 cun (132.1 chi)
   - The volume is calculated using the formula for a trapezoidal prism:
     \[
     V = \frac{(上廣 + 下廣) \times 深 \times 袤}{2}
     \]

2. **Labor Calculation**:
   - The total volume of the trench is 10,943.8 chi³.
   - Each worker can dig 871 chi³ of earth.
   - Adjustments:
     - Remove 1/5 of the labor for "removing earth."
     - Remove 1/2 of the labor for "gravel, water, and stone."
   - The remaining labor per worker is used to calculate the number of workers required.

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Volume Calculation**:
   - The trapezoidal prism formula is used to calculate the trench's volume.
   - All dimensions are converted into chi (尺) for consistency.

2. **Labor Calculation**:
   - Each worker's capacity is adjusted by removing 1/5 for "removing earth" and 1/2 for "gravel, water, and stone."
   - The remaining effective labor is used to calculate the number of workers required.

3. **Output**:
   - The trench volume is printed in chi³.
   - The number of workers required is calculated and printed as a fraction for precision.

---

### Example Output:

```
Trench volume: 10943.8 chi³
Number of workers needed: 14 people
```
