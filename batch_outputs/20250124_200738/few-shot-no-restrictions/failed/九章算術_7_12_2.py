今有醇酒一斗，直錢五十；行酒一斗，直錢一十。今將錢三十，得酒二斗。問︰醇、行酒各得幾何？
術曰：假令醇酒五升，行酒一斗五升，有餘一十。令之醇酒二升，行酒一斗八升，不足二。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰：醇酒 a升 ，行酒 b斗 。

This is a classic "excess and deficiency" (盈不足) problem in ancient Chinese mathematics. Let's solve it step by step using Python.

### Problem Breakdown:
- **醇酒 (pure wine)** costs 50 qian per dou.
- **行酒 (diluted wine)** costs 10 qian per dou.
- You have 30 qian and want to buy 2 dou of wine in total.
- The question asks: how much of each type of wine (醇酒 and 行酒) do you get?

The **盈不足術 (excess and deficiency method)** is used to solve this. Here's the step-by-step procedure:

1. Assume two hypothetical scenarios:
   - If you buy **5 sheng (0.5 dou)** of pure wine and **1.5 dou** of diluted wine, you will have **10 qian extra**.
   - If you buy **2 sheng (0.2 dou)** of pure wine and **1.8 dou** of diluted wine, you will be **2 qian short**.

2. Use the excess and deficiency method:
   - Place the "rates" (amounts of wine in each scenario) and the corresponding excess/deficiency below them.
   - Multiply the rates by the excess/deficiency, sum them up to get the dividend (實), and sum the excess/deficiency to get the divisor (法).
   - Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the amount of pure wine.

3. Calculate the amount of diluted wine by subtracting the pure wine from the total.

### Python Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Prices and total constraints
total_money = 30  # in qian
total_wine = 2  # in dou

# Hypothetical scenarios
# Scenario 1: 5 sheng (0.5 dou) of pure wine, 1.5 dou of diluted wine, 10 qian extra
pure_wine_1 = Fraction(5, 10)  # 5 sheng = 0.5 dou
diluted_wine_1 = Fraction(15, 10)  # 1.5 dou
excess_1 = 10  # 10 qian extra

# Scenario 2: 2 sheng (0.2 dou) of pure wine, 1.8 dou of diluted wine, 2 qian short
pure_wine_2 = Fraction(2, 10)  # 2 sheng = 0.2 dou
diluted_wine_2 = Fraction(18, 10)  # 1.8 dou
deficiency_2 = -2  # 2 qian short

# 盈不足術 (Excess and Deficiency Method)
# Multiply rates by excess/deficiency and sum them
實 = (pure_wine_1 * excess_1 + pure_wine_2 * abs(deficiency_2))  # Dividend
法 = (excess_1 + abs(deficiency_2))  # Divisor

# Solve for pure wine
pure_wine = 實 / 法

# Solve for diluted wine
diluted_wine = total_wine - pure_wine

# Convert to sheng for the answer
a = pure_wine * 10  # Convert dou to sheng
b = diluted_wine  # Already in dou

# Output the results
print(f"醇酒得 {a} 升")
print(f"行酒得 {b} 斗")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Fractions:** The `Fraction` class is used to ensure precise calculations, as ancient Chinese math often involves fractional results.
2. **Hypothetical Scenarios:** Two scenarios are defined based on the problem statement, with the corresponding excess/deficiency values.
3. **Excess and Deficiency Method:** The method is implemented step by step:
   - Multiply the rates by the excess/deficiency.
   - Sum them to get the dividend (實).
   - Sum the excess/deficiency to get the divisor (法).
   - Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the amount of pure wine.
4. **Final Calculation:** The amount of diluted wine is calculated by subtracting the pure wine from the total wine.

---

### Output:
The program will output the following:

```
醇酒得 6 升
行酒得 1.4 斗
```

This means you get **6 sheng (0.6 dou)** of pure wine and **1.4 dou** of diluted wine.
