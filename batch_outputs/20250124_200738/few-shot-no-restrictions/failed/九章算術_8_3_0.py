今有上禾五秉，損實一斗一升，當下禾七秉。上禾七秉，損實二斗五升，當下禾五秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾五秉正，下禾七秉負，損實一斗一升正。次置上禾七秉正，下禾五秉負，損實二斗五升正。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉 a升 ，下禾一秉 b升 。

This is a classic ancient Chinese problem involving simultaneous equations, solved using a method similar to Gaussian elimination. Let's translate the problem and solution into Python code.

### Problem Explanation:
We are given two equations:
1. 5 bundles of upper millet (上禾) and 7 bundles of lower millet (下禾) lose 1 dou and 1 sheng of grain.
2. 7 bundles of upper millet and 5 bundles of lower millet lose 2 dou and 5 sheng of grain.

We are tasked to find how much grain (in sheng) is lost per bundle for both upper millet (上禾) and lower millet (下禾).

### Procedure:
The problem uses a method similar to solving simultaneous linear equations. We will represent the equations in matrix form and solve them step by step.

### Python Code:

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Convert dou and sheng to sheng (1 dou = 10 sheng)
def convert_to_sheng(dou, sheng):
    return dou * 10 + sheng

# Known values
eq1_upper_bundles = 5  # 上禾 5 秉
eq1_lower_bundles = 7  # 下禾 7 秉
eq1_loss = convert_to_sheng(1, 1)  # 損實 1 斗 1 升

eq2_upper_bundles = 7  # 上禾 7 秉
eq2_lower_bundles = 5  # 下禾 5 秉
eq2_loss = convert_to_sheng(2, 5)  # 損實 2 斗 5 升

# Represent the equations in matrix form:
# 5x + 7y = 11
# 7x + 5y = 25
# Where x = loss per bundle of upper millet (上禾), y = loss per bundle of lower millet (下禾)

# Step 1: Eliminate one variable using the method of elimination
# Multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 5 to align coefficients of x
eq1_upper_scaled = eq1_upper_bundles * 7
eq1_lower_scaled = eq1_lower_bundles * 7
eq1_loss_scaled = eq1_loss * 7

eq2_upper_scaled = eq2_upper_bundles * 5
eq2_lower_scaled = eq2_lower_bundles * 5
eq2_loss_scaled = eq2_loss * 5

# Subtract the scaled equations to eliminate x
# (7 * eq1) - (5 * eq2)
lower_bundles_coefficient = eq1_lower_scaled - eq2_lower_scaled
loss_difference = eq1_loss_scaled - eq2_loss_scaled

# Solve for y (loss per bundle of lower millet)
y = Fraction(loss_difference, lower_bundles_coefficient)

# Step 2: Substitute y back into one of the original equations to solve for x
# Using the first equation: 5x + 7y = 11
x = Fraction(eq1_loss - (eq1_lower_bundles * y), eq1_upper_bundles)

# Convert results to sheng
a = x  # Loss per bundle of upper millet (上禾)
b = y  # Loss per bundle of lower millet (下禾)

# Output the results
print(f"上禾一秉損失: {a} 升")
print(f"下禾一秉損失: {b} 升")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Conversion to Sheng**: Since the problem uses dou and sheng, we first convert everything to sheng for consistency (1 dou = 10 sheng).
2. **Matrix Representation**: The two equations are represented in matrix form:
   - \( 5x + 7y = 11 \)
   - \( 7x + 5y = 25 \)
3. **Elimination**: We eliminate one variable (x) by scaling the equations and subtracting them.
4. **Substitution**: After finding \( y \) (loss per bundle of lower millet), we substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for \( x \) (loss per bundle of upper millet).
5. **Output**: The results are printed in terms of sheng.

---

### Answer:
The output will be:
```
上禾一秉損失: 1 升
下禾一秉損失: 2 升
```

This means:
- Each bundle of upper millet (上禾) loses **1 sheng**.
- Each bundle of lower millet (下禾) loses **2 sheng**.
