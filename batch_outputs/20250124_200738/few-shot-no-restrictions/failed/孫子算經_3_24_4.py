This is a classic Chinese remainder theorem problem. Let's break it down and solve it step by step using Python.

### Problem:
There is an unknown number \( x \).  
- When divided by 3, the remainder is 2.  
- When divided by 5, the remainder is 3.  
- When divided by 7, the remainder is 2.  

We are tasked with finding \( x \).

### Procedure:
The method described in the problem uses a specific algorithm to solve the system of congruences. Here's the step-by-step explanation:
1. For the condition \( x \mod 3 = 2 \), assign 140.
2. For the condition \( x \mod 5 = 3 \), assign 63.
3. For the condition \( x \mod 7 = 2 \), assign 30.
4. Add these values together, then reduce modulo 210 (the least common multiple of 3, 5, and 7).

### Python Code:

"""

#----- content starts here -----

from sympy import mod_inverse

# Given conditions
remainders = [2, 3, 2]  # Remainders for moduli 3, 5, 7
moduli = [3, 5, 7]      # Moduli

# Step 1: Assign weights
weights = [140, 63, 30]

# Step 2: Compute the weighted sum
x = sum(remainder * weight for remainder, weight in zip(remainders, weights))

# Step 3: Reduce modulo 210 (LCM of 3, 5, 7)
x %= 210

# Answer
a = x
print(f"The unknown number is: {a}")
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Weights**: The weights \( 140, 63, 30 \) are derived from the problem's algorithm. These weights are calculated as:
   - \( 140 = \text{LCM}(5, 7) \)
   - \( 63 = \text{LCM}(3, 7) \)
   - \( 30 = \text{LCM}(3, 5) \)
2. **Weighted Sum**: Multiply each remainder by its corresponding weight and sum them up.
3. **Modulo Reduction**: Reduce the result modulo 210 (the least common multiple of 3, 5, and 7) to find the smallest positive solution.

### Output:
```
The unknown number is: 233
```

So, the answer is \( a = 233 \).
