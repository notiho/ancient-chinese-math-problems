This problem involves calculating the total number of items in a square bundle of objects, where the outer perimeter of the square is given, and each side of the square contains 32 items. The procedure involves a specific algorithm for determining the total count.

Let's translate this into Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

# 方物一束外周，一市有三十二枚
外周 = 32  # The number of items on one side of the square

# 術曰：重置二位左位減八餘加右位，至盡虛加一，即得
# This algorithm is not fully clear in its description, but we will interpret it step by step.

# Step 1: Calculate the total number of items in the square
# Since the square has 4 sides, and each side has 32 items,
# the total number of items is the square of the side length.

a = 外周 ** 2  # Total number of items in the square

# Output the result
print(f"答曰：{a}枚")
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. The problem states that the square has an outer perimeter, and each side contains 32 items.
2. To calculate the total number of items in the square, we square the number of items on one side (`外周 ** 2`).
3. The algorithm mentioned in the problem seems to involve some additional steps, but based on the description, the simplest interpretation is to calculate the square of the side length.

If the algorithm provided in the problem has a more specific meaning, feel free to clarify, and I can adjust the code accordingly!
