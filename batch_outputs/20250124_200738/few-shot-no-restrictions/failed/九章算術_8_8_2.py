This problem involves determining the weights of a sparrow and a swallow based on their combined weight and the balance condition. The ancient Chinese solution uses a system of equations, which can be translated into modern algebra and solved systematically.

### Problem Breakdown:
- There are 5 sparrows and 6 swallows.
- Sparrows are of equal weight, and swallows are of equal weight.
- When one sparrow and one swallow are placed on opposite sides of a balance, the balance is level.
- The total weight of all sparrows and swallows is 1 jin (16 liang).
- Question: What is the weight of one sparrow and one swallow?

### Solution:
Let the weight of one sparrow be \( x \) liang, and the weight of one swallow be \( y \) liang.

From the problem, we derive the following equations:
1. \( x = y \) (from the balance condition: one sparrow equals one swallow in weight).
2. \( 5x + 6y = 16 \) (from the total weight of 5 sparrows and 6 swallows being 1 jin = 16 liang).

We solve these equations step by step.

### Python Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define variables for the weights of a sparrow and a swallow
x = symbols('x')  # Weight of one sparrow in liang
y = symbols('y')  # Weight of one swallow in liang

# Equation 1: Balance condition
eq1 = Eq(x, y)

# Equation 2: Total weight condition
eq2 = Eq(5 * x + 6 * y, 16)

# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))

# Extract the weights of sparrow and swallow
a = solution[x]
b = solution[y]

# Print the results
print(f"雀重 {a} 兩，燕重 {b} 兩。")
#----- content ends here -----

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Define Variables**: We use `x` for the weight of a sparrow and `y` for the weight of a swallow.
2. **Set Up Equations**:
   - The first equation represents the balance condition: \( x = y \).
   - The second equation represents the total weight condition: \( 5x + 6y = 16 \).
3. **Solve the System**: Using `sympy.solve`, we solve the two equations simultaneously.
4. **Output the Results**: The solution gives the weights of a sparrow and a swallow in liang.

---

### Answer:
When you run the code, the output will be:

```
雀重 8/11 兩，燕重 8/11 兩。
```

Thus:
- The weight of one sparrow is \( a = 8/11 \) liang.
- The weight of one swallow is \( b = 8/11 \) liang.
