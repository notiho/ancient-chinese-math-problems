假令有句股相乘冪七百六十五分之一，弦多於句三十六十分之九。問：三事各多少？
術曰：冪自乘，倍多數而一，為實。半多數，為廉法，從。開立方除之，即句。以弦多句加之，即弦。以句除冪，即股。
答曰：句 a ，股 b ，弦 c 。

This is a classic problem from ancient Chinese mathematics involving a right triangle where the hypotenuse (弦), the base (句), and the height (股) are related through the Pythagorean theorem. The problem provides the following information:

1. The product of the base (句) and the height (股) is \( \frac{1}{765} \) (冪, the area of the triangle).
2. The hypotenuse (弦) exceeds the base (句) by \( \frac{9}{36} = \frac{1}{4} \).

The goal is to find the values of the base (句), height (股), and hypotenuse (弦).

### Procedure:
1. Square the area (冪自乘).
2. Multiply the result by twice the excess of the hypotenuse over the base (倍多數而一).
3. Take half of the excess (半多數) as the divisor (廉法).
4. Extract the cube root of the result divided by the divisor to find the base (句).
5. Add the excess to the base to find the hypotenuse (弦).
6. Divide the area by the base to find the height (股).

Let's implement this in Python:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction
from sympy import Rational, cbrt

# Given data
冪 = Fraction(1, 765)  # The area of the triangle
弦多句 = Fraction(9, 36)  # The hypotenuse exceeds the base by 9/36 = 1/4

# Step 1: 冪自乘 (square the area)
冪平方 = 冪 ** 2

# Step 2: 倍多數而一 (multiply by twice the excess plus one)
實 = 冪平方 * (2 * 弦多句 + 1)

# Step 3: 半多數 (half of the excess)
廉法 = 弦多句 / 2

# Step 4: 開立方除之，即句 (extract the cube root of the result divided by the divisor)
句 = cbrt(實 / 廉法)

# Step 5: 以弦多句加之，即弦 (add the excess to the base to find the hypotenuse)
弦 = 句 + 弦多句

# Step 6: 以句除冪，即股 (divide the area by the base to find the height)
股 = 冪 / 句

# Results
a = 句
b = 股
c = 弦

print(f"句 (base): {a}")
print(f"股 (height): {b}")
print(f"弦 (hypotenuse): {c}")

"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **冪自乘**: The area of the triangle is squared.
2. **倍多數而一**: The result is multiplied by twice the excess of the hypotenuse over the base plus one.
3. **半多數**: Half of the excess is taken as the divisor.
4. **開立方除之**: The cube root of the result divided by the divisor gives the base (句).
5. **以弦多句加之**: Adding the excess to the base gives the hypotenuse (弦).
6. **以句除冪**: Dividing the area by the base gives the height (股).

### Output:
The values of the base (句), height (股), and hypotenuse (弦) will be printed as fractions for precise representation.
