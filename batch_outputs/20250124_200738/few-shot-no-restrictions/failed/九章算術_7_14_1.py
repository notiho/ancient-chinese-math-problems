今有漆三得油四，油四和漆五。今有漆三斗，欲令分以易油，還自和餘漆。問︰出漆、得油、和漆各幾何？
術曰：假令出漆九升，不足六升。令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰：出漆 a斗 ，得油 b斗 ，和漆 c斗 ， d升 。

This problem involves a proportional exchange of lacquer (漆) and oil (油), followed by combining the remaining lacquer with the obtained oil. Let's break it down step by step and solve it using Python.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Exchange Rates**:
   - 3 dou of lacquer can be exchanged for 4 dou of oil.
   - 4 dou of oil can be mixed with 5 dou of lacquer.

2. **Given**:
   - There are 3 dou of lacquer available.
   - We want to determine:
     - How much lacquer is exchanged (出漆, "lacquer given").
     - How much oil is obtained (得油, "oil obtained").
     - How much lacquer remains and is mixed with the obtained oil (和漆, "lacquer mixed with oil").

3. **Procedure**:
   - Use the "盈不足術" (Surplus and Deficit Method) to calculate the exchange and mixing proportions.
   - Follow the rules for proportional exchange and mixing.

### Python Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given exchange rates
漆_to_油_rate = Fraction(4, 3)  # 3 dou of lacquer gets 4 dou of oil
油_to_漆_rate = Fraction(5, 4)  # 4 dou of oil mixes with 5 dou of lacquer

# Initial amount of lacquer
initial_漆 = 3  # in dou

# Step 1: Determine how much lacquer is exchanged (出漆)
# Assume we exchange all lacquer initially
出漆 = initial_漆  # Start by exchanging all lacquer

# Step 2: Determine how much oil is obtained (得油)
得油 = 出漆 * 漆_to_油_rate  # Use the exchange rate

# Step 3: Determine how much lacquer is left after exchange
remaining_漆 = initial_漆 - 出漆  # Remaining lacquer after exchange

# Step 4: Combine remaining lacquer with obtained oil (和漆)
# The total lacquer mixed with oil is the remaining lacquer
和漆 = remaining_漆 + 得油 * 油_to_漆_rate  # Mix remaining lacquer with oil

# Convert 和漆 to dou and sheng (1 dou = 10 sheng)
和漆_dou = 和漆 // 1  # Integer part (dou)
和漆_sheng = (和漆 - 和漆_dou) * 10  # Fractional part converted to sheng

# Output results
a = 出漆  # Lacquer exchanged (in dou)
b = 得油  # Oil obtained (in dou)
c = 和漆_dou  # Lacquer mixed with oil (in dou)
d = 和漆_sheng  # Remaining lacquer mixed with oil (in sheng)

print(f"出漆 {a}斗 ，得油 {b}斗 ，和漆 {c}斗 ， {d}升 。")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Exchange Rates**:
   - `漆_to_油_rate` represents the rate at which lacquer is exchanged for oil (4 dou of oil for 3 dou of lacquer).
   - `油_to_漆_rate` represents the rate at which oil is mixed with lacquer (5 dou of lacquer for 4 dou of oil).

2. **Initial Lacquer**:
   - Start with 3 dou of lacquer.

3. **Exchange Calculation**:
   - Assume all lacquer is exchanged initially.
   - Calculate the amount of oil obtained using the exchange rate.

4. **Remaining Lacquer**:
   - Subtract the exchanged lacquer from the initial amount to get the remaining lacquer.

5. **Mixing Calculation**:
   - Combine the remaining lacquer with the obtained oil using the mixing rate.

6. **Conversion**:
   - Convert the final mixed lacquer amount into dou and sheng for the answer.

---

### Example Output:
If you run the code, it will calculate and output the following:
```
出漆 3斗 ，得油 4斗 ，和漆 5斗 ， 0升 。
```

This means:
- 3 dou of lacquer are exchanged.
- 4 dou of oil are obtained.
- After mixing, the total lacquer mixed with oil is 5 dou and 0 sheng.
