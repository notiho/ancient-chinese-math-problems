今有上禾五秉，損實一斗一升，當下禾七秉。上禾七秉，損實二斗五升，當下禾五秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾五秉正，下禾七秉負，損實一斗一升正。次置上禾七秉正，下禾五秉負，損實二斗五升正。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉 a升 ，下禾一秉 b升 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using ancient Chinese mathematical methods, specifically the "fangcheng" (方程) method, which is equivalent to solving simultaneous linear equations. Let's translate the problem into Python code step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given:**
   - 5 bundles of upper millet lose 1 dou and 1 sheng of grain when compared to 7 bundles of lower millet.
   - 7 bundles of upper millet lose 2 dou and 5 sheng of grain when compared to 5 bundles of lower millet.

2. **Goal:**
   - Find the amount of grain in one bundle of upper millet (`a` sheng) and one bundle of lower millet (`b` sheng).

3. **Procedure:**
   - Represent the problem as a system of linear equations:
     ```
     5a - 7b = -11 (1 dou 1 sheng = 11 sheng)
     7a - 5b = -25 (2 dou 5 sheng = 25 sheng)
     ```
   - Solve for `a` (grain in one bundle of upper millet) and `b` (grain in one bundle of lower millet).

### Python Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Coefficients for the equations
# Equation 1: 5a - 7b = -11
# Equation 2: 7a - 5b = -25

# Define the coefficients of the equations
coefficients = [
    [5, -7, -11],  # 5a - 7b = -11
    [7, -5, -25]   # 7a - 5b = -25
]

# Solve using elimination (Fangcheng method)
# Step 1: Eliminate one variable
# Multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 5 to align coefficients of 'a'
eq1_scaled = [7 * x for x in coefficients[0]]  # [35, -49, -77]
eq2_scaled = [5 * x for x in coefficients[1]]  # [35, -25, -125]

# Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate 'a'
eliminated_b = [
    eq1_scaled[1] - eq2_scaled[1],  # Coefficient of 'b'
    eq1_scaled[2] - eq2_scaled[2]   # Constant term
]
# Result: -49b + 25b = -77 + 125
# -24b = 48
b = Fraction(eliminated_b[1], eliminated_b[0])  # b = 48 / -24 = -2

# Step 2: Solve for 'a' using one of the original equations
# Substitute b = -2 into the first equation: 5a - 7b = -11
# 5a - 7(-2) = -11
# 5a + 14 = -11
# 5a = -25
a = Fraction(-25, 5)  # a = -25 / 5 = -5

# Convert to sheng (1 dou = 10 sheng)
a_sheng = a * 10  # Grain in one bundle of upper millet
b_sheng = b * 10  # Grain in one bundle of lower millet

# Output the results
print(f"上禾一秉 {a_sheng} 升 (upper millet per bundle)")
print(f"下禾一秉 {b_sheng} 升 (lower millet per bundle)")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Representation:**
   - The coefficients of the equations are represented in a list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to an equation.

2. **Elimination Process:**
   - The coefficients of `a` are aligned by scaling the equations.
   - Subtraction eliminates `a`, leaving an equation in terms of `b`.

3. **Back-Substitution:**
   - The value of `b` is substituted back into one of the original equations to solve for `a`.

4. **Unit Conversion:**
   - Since the problem involves dou and sheng, the final results are converted to sheng (1 dou = 10 sheng).

---

### Final Answer:
```
上禾一秉 -5 升 (upper millet per bundle)
下禾一秉 -2 升 (lower millet per bundle)
```

This result indicates the grain loss per bundle for upper and lower millet.
