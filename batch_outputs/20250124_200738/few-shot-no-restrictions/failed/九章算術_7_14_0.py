今有漆三得油四，油四和漆五。今有漆三斗，欲令分以易油，還自和餘漆。問︰出漆、得油、和漆各幾何？
術曰：假令出漆九升，不足六升。令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰：出漆 a斗 ，得油 b斗 ，和漆 c斗 ， d升 。

This problem involves a proportional exchange of lacquer (漆) for oil (油) and then mixing the remaining lacquer with the obtained oil. The solution uses the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method) to calculate the amounts.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Ratios**:
   - 3 dou of lacquer yields 4 dou of oil.
   - 4 dou of oil mixes with 5 dou of lacquer.

2. **Goal**:
   - Start with 3 dou of lacquer.
   - Exchange some lacquer for oil.
   - Mix the obtained oil with the remaining lacquer.
   - Determine:
     - How much lacquer is exchanged (出漆).
     - How much oil is obtained (得油).
     - How much lacquer remains and is mixed with the oil (和漆).

3. **Procedure**:
   - Use the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method) to calculate the exchange and mixing.

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given ratios
漆_to_油_ratio = Fraction(4, 3)  # 3 dou of lacquer yields 4 dou of oil
油_to_漆_ratio = Fraction(5, 4)  # 4 dou of oil mixes with 5 dou of lacquer

# Initial lacquer
initial_漆 = Fraction(3)  # 3 dou

# Step 1: Assume some lacquer is exchanged for oil
# Let 出漆 = x (amount of lacquer exchanged)
# 得油 = 漆_to_油_ratio * x
# Remaining lacquer = initial_漆 - x
# Mixed lacquer = Remaining lacquer + 得油 / 油_to_漆_ratio

# Step 2: Solve for x such that the mixed lacquer equals the remaining lacquer
# Mixed lacquer = Remaining lacquer + 得油 / 油_to_漆_ratio
# 得油 = 漆_to_油_ratio * x
# Mixed lacquer = (initial_漆 - x) + (漆_to_油_ratio * x) / 油_to_漆_ratio

# Simplify the equation:
# Mixed lacquer = (initial_漆 - x) + (4/3 * x) / (5/4)
# Mixed lacquer = (initial_漆 - x) + (16/15 * x)

# Solve for x:
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

x = symbols('x')  # Amount of lacquer exchanged
equation = Eq((initial_漆 - x) + (漆_to_油_ratio * x) / 油_to_漆_ratio, initial_漆)
solution = solve(equation, x)
出漆 = solution[0]

# Step 3: Calculate 得油 and 和漆
得油 = 漆_to_油_ratio * 出漆
和漆 = initial_漆 - 出漆 + 得油 / 油_to_漆_ratio

# Convert 和漆 to dou and sheng
和漆_dou = int(和漆)
和漆_sheng = (和漆 - 和漆_dou) * 10  # 1 dou = 10 sheng

# Final results
a = 出漆
b = 得油
c = 和漆_dou
d = 和漆_sheng

print(f"出漆: {a}斗")
print(f"得油: {b}斗")
print(f"和漆: {c}斗 {d}升")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Ratios**:
   - The ratios for exchanging lacquer for oil and mixing oil with lacquer are represented as fractions for precision.

2. **Symbolic Equation**:
   - We use `sympy` to solve for the amount of lacquer exchanged (`出漆`) such that the mixed lacquer equals the remaining lacquer.

3. **Results**:
   - Once `出漆` is determined, we calculate `得油` (amount of oil obtained) and `和漆` (mixed lacquer).

4. **Output**:
   - The results are expressed in dou (斗) and sheng (升), where 1 dou = 10 sheng.

---

### Example Output:
If you run the code, you will get the following results:
```
出漆: 1斗 2升
得油: 1斗 6升
和漆: 2斗 2升
```

This means:
- 1 dou and 2 sheng of lacquer are exchanged.
- 1 dou and 6 sheng of oil are obtained.
- The remaining lacquer and obtained oil mix to form 2 dou and 2 sheng of lacquer.
