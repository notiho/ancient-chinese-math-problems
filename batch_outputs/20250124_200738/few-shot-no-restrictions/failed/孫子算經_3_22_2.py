This problem is a bit cryptic, but it appears to involve calculating the total number of items in a bundle of square-shaped objects based on a specific counting method. The procedure described involves manipulating the digits of the given number in a specific way to compute the result.

Let's break it down step by step and implement it in Python:

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: A square bundle of items with a total of 32 items in one side (外周, the outer perimeter).
2. **Procedure**:
   - Take the number (32 in this case).
   - Split it into two digits: the left digit and the right digit.
   - Subtract 8 from the left digit, then add the right digit.
   - Repeat this process until the number is reduced to a single digit.
   - Add 1 to the result to get the final answer.

### Python Implementation:

#----- content starts here -----

# Input: Total number of items in one side of the square bundle
外周 = 32

# Procedure to calculate the total number of items
def calculate_total(外周):
    # Convert the number to a string to manipulate digits
    num = str(外周)
    
    while len(num) > 1:  # Repeat until the number is reduced to a single digit
        left_digit = int(num[0])  # Leftmost digit
        right_digit = int(num[1])  # Rightmost digit
        new_digit = (left_digit - 8) + right_digit  # Subtract 8 from the left, add the right
        num = str(new_digit)  # Update the number as a string
    
    # Add 1 to the final result
    return int(num) + 1

# Calculate the total
a = calculate_total(外周)
print(f"答曰：{a} 枚。")
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. The input number (`外周`) is converted to a string to allow manipulation of its digits.
2. The leftmost and rightmost digits are extracted.
3. The procedure described in the problem is applied: subtract 8 from the left digit, add the right digit, and repeat until the number is reduced to a single digit.
4. Finally, 1 is added to the result to get the total.

### Answer:
For the given input of `外周 = 32`, the code will calculate the total number of items in the bundle.
