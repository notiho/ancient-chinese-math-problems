### Problem Breakdown and Solution in Python

#### Problem Description:
1. **Volume Calculation**:
   - A valley has the following dimensions:
     - Top width: 2 zhang
     - Top length: 7 zhang
     - Bottom width: 8 chi
     - Bottom length: 4 zhang
     - Depth: 6 zhang 5 chi
   - Question: What is the total volume?

2. **Transportation Problem**:
   - The total volume is 52,000 chi³.
   - A cart carries 34 chi 7 cun of soil per trip.
   - The cart travels:
     - 200 bu for loading/unloading.
     - 1 li for transportation.
     - Total distance: 58 li.
   - 6 people share one cart.
   - Question:
     - How much soil does one person transport?
     - How many workers are required?

---

### Step 1: Volume Calculation

The valley is shaped like a frustum of a rectangular pyramid. The formula for the volume of a frustum is:

\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \cdot h \cdot (A_1 + A_2 + \sqrt{A_1 \cdot A_2})
\]

Where:
- \( h \) is the height (depth of the valley).
- \( A_1 \) is the area of the top rectangle.
- \( A_2 \) is the area of the bottom rectangle.

---

### Step 2: Transportation Problem

1. **Soil transported by one person**:
   - Total soil transported by the cart in one trip: \( 34 \, \text{chi} + 7 \, \text{cun} = 34.7 \, \text{chi}^3 \).
   - Total trips: \( \text{Total volume} / \text{Volume per trip} \).
   - Total distance per trip: \( 200 \, \text{bu} + 1 \, \text{li} = 1.5 \, \text{li} \).
   - Total distance for all trips: \( \text{Total trips} \times 58 \, \text{li} \).
   - Soil transported by one person: Divide the total soil by the number of people (6 per cart).

2. **Number of workers required**:
   - Divide the total volume by the soil transported by one person.

### Python Code Implementation


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Step 1: Volume Calculation
# Dimensions
top_width = 2 * 10  # 2 zhang = 20 chi
top_length = 7 * 10  # 7 zhang = 70 chi
bottom_width = 8  # 8 chi
bottom_length = 4 * 10  # 4 zhang = 40 chi
depth = 6 * 10 + 5  # 6 zhang 5 chi = 65 chi

# Areas
A1 = top_width * top_length  # Top area
A2 = bottom_width * bottom_length  # Bottom area

# Volume formula for a frustum
volume = Fraction(1, 3) * depth * (A1 + A2 + (A1 * A2) ** 0.5)
volume = round(volume)  # Round to nearest integer
print(f"Volume of the valley: {volume} chi³")

# Step 2: Transportation Problem
# Given values
cart_capacity = 34 + Fraction(7, 10)  # 34 chi 7 cun = 34.7 chi³
round_trip_distance = 200 / 240 + 1  # 200 bu = 200/240 li, plus 1 li
total_distance = 58  # Total distance in li
people_per_cart = 6

# Total trips required
total_trips = volume / cart_capacity

# Soil transported by one person
soil_per_person = (cart_capacity * total_distance) / (round_trip_distance * people_per_cart)

# Number of workers required
workers_required = volume / soil_per_person

# Results
a = round(soil_per_person)  # Soil transported by one person
b = round(workers_required)  # Number of workers required

print(f"One person transports: {a} chi³")
print(f"Number of workers required: {b}")

### Explanation of Results:
1. **Volume of the valley**: \( 52,000 \, \text{chi}^3 \) (as given in the problem).
2. **Soil transported by one person**: \( a \, \text{chi}^3 \).
3. **Number of workers required**: \( b \, \text{people} \).

This Python code calculates the required values step by step, following the ancient Chinese mathematical procedure.
