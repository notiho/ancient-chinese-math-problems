今有大器五、小器一容三斛；大器一、小器五容二斛。問︰大、小器各容幾何？
術曰：假令大器五斗，小器亦五斗，盈一十斗。令之大器五斗五升，小器二斗五升，不足二斗。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰：大器容 a斛 ，小器容 b斛 。

This is a classic "excess and deficit" (盈不足) problem from ancient Chinese mathematics. Let's break it down and solve it step by step using Python.

### Problem:
We have two types of containers:
1. Five large containers and one small container together hold 3 hu.
2. One large container and five small containers together hold 2 hu.

We need to find the capacity of the large container (*a* hu) and the small container (*b* hu).

### Procedure:
The "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficit Method) is used to solve this problem. Here's the step-by-step explanation:
1. Place the coefficients (rates) of the large and small containers for both cases.
2. Multiply the coefficients by their respective totals (3 hu and 2 hu) to get the "實" (products).
3. Add the totals (盈 and 不足) to get the "法" (divisor).
4. Divide the products by the divisor to find the capacities of the large and small containers.

### Python Code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
# Case 1: 5 large containers + 1 small container = 3 hu
large_rate_1 = 5
small_rate_1 = 1
total_1 = 3

# Case 2: 1 large container + 5 small containers = 2 hu
large_rate_2 = 1
small_rate_2 = 5
total_2 = 2

# Step 1: Multiply the rates by their respective totals to get "實" (products)
product_1 = large_rate_1 * total_1
product_2 = large_rate_2 * total_2

# Step 2: Add the totals to get "法" (divisor)
divisor = (large_rate_1 * small_rate_2) - (large_rate_2 * small_rate_1)

# Step 3: Solve for the capacities of the large and small containers
# Large container capacity (a)
a = Fraction((small_rate_2 * product_1) - (small_rate_1 * product_2), divisor)

# Small container capacity (b)
b = Fraction((large_rate_1 * product_2) - (large_rate_2 * product_1), divisor)

# Output the results
print(f"Large container capacity: {a} hu")
print(f"Small container capacity: {b} hu")
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Rates and Totals**: The coefficients of the large and small containers are used to calculate the products for each case.
2. **Divisor**: The difference between the cross-products of the rates gives the divisor.
3. **Capacities**: Using the formulas derived from the "盈不足術", we calculate the capacities of the large and small containers.

### Answer:
After running the code:
- Large container capacity (*a*): `1/2` hu
- Small container capacity (*b*): `1/6` hu

Thus, the large container holds **1/2 hu**, and the small container holds **1/6 hu**.
