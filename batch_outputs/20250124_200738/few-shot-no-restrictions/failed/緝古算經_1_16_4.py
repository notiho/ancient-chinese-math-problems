假令有句弦相乘冪一千三百三十七二十分之一，弦多股一、十分之一。問：股多少？
術曰：冪自乘，倍多而一，為立冪。又多再自乘，半之，減立冪，余為實。又多數自乘，倍之，為方法。又置多數，五之，二而一，為廉法，從。開立方除之，即股。案：此術脫簡既多，法亦煩擾，宜雲冪自乘，多數而一，所得四之，為實。多為廉法，從。立方開之，得減差，半之，即股。
答曰： a 。

This problem involves solving for the "leg" (股) of a right triangle given the product of the hypotenuse (弦) and the base (句), as well as the relationship between the hypotenuse and the base. The problem is complex and involves cubic equations and simplifications. Let's break it down step by step and implement it in Python.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given:**
   - The product of the hypotenuse and the base (冪, "power") is \( 1337 \frac{1}{20} \).
   - The hypotenuse (弦) exceeds the base (股) by \( 1 \frac{1}{10} \).

2. **Procedure:**
   - The procedure involves multiple steps, including squaring, cubing, and simplifying equations to solve for the base (股).

3. **Simplified Method:**
   - The problem suggests a simplified method:
     - Multiply the given "power" (冪) by the excess of the hypotenuse over the base (多數).
     - Divide the result by 4 to get the "real value" (實).
     - Use the excess (多數) as the divisor (廉法).
     - Extract the cube root and adjust to find the base (股).

### Python Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction
from sympy import cbrt  # For cube root

# Given values
冪 = Fraction(1337, 1) + Fraction(1, 20)  # 冪: 1337 1/20
多數 = Fraction(1, 1) + Fraction(1, 10)  # 多數: 1 1/10

# Simplified procedure:
# Step 1: 冪自乘，多數而一，所得四之，為實
實 = (冪 * 多數) / 4

# Step 2: 多數為廉法，從
廉法 = 多數

# Step 3: Extract the cube root and adjust
股 = cbrt(實 / 廉法)

# Output the result
a = 股
print(f"股 = {a}")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Values:**
   - The "power" (冪) is \( 1337 \frac{1}{20} \), represented as a `Fraction`.
   - The excess (多數) is \( 1 \frac{1}{10} \), also represented as a `Fraction`.

2. **Simplified Procedure:**
   - Multiply the "power" by the excess and divide by 4 to get the "real value" (實).
   - Use the excess as the divisor (廉法).
   - Divide the "real value" by the divisor and extract the cube root to find the base (股).

3. **Output:**
   - The result is the value of the base (股), which is printed as a fraction or decimal.

---

### Note:
This implementation uses Python's `sympy` library for symbolic computation, specifically for extracting cube roots. If you don't have `sympy` installed, you can install it using `pip install sympy`.
