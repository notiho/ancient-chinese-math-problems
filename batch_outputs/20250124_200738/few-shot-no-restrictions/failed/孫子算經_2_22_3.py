今有錢六千九百三十，欲令二百一十六人作九分，分之八十一人，人與二分；七十二人，人與三分；六十三人，人與四分。問：三種各得幾何？
術曰：先置八十一人于上，七十二人次之，六十三人在下，頭位以二乘之，得一百六十二，次位以三乘之，得二百一十六，下位以四乘之，得二百五十二，副并三位，得六百三十為法。又置錢六千九百三十為三位頭位，以一百六十二乘之，得一百一十二萬二千六百六十，又以二百一十六乘中位，得一百四十九萬六千八百八十，又以二百五十二乘下位，得一百七十四萬六千三百六十，各為實以法，六百三十各除之，頭位得一千七百八十二，中位得二千三百七十六，下位得二千七百七十二，各以人數除之，即得。
答曰：二分人得錢 a ，三分人得錢 b ，四分人得錢 c 。

This problem involves distributing a total of 6930 coins among 216 people, divided into three groups based on their shares. The first group of 81 people receives 2 shares each, the second group of 72 people receives 3 shares each, and the third group of 63 people receives 4 shares each. The goal is to calculate how much money each group receives.

### Procedure:
1. Multiply the number of people in each group by their respective shares to calculate the total shares for each group.
2. Add up the total shares across all groups to determine the divisor (法).
3. Multiply the total amount of money (6930 coins) by the total shares of each group to calculate the dividend (實) for each group.
4. Divide the dividend of each group by the divisor to determine the total money allocated to each group.
5. Divide the total money for each group by the number of people in the group to determine how much each person in that group receives.

### Python Code:

from fractions import Fraction

# Total money and group sizes

group2_people = 72
group3_people = 63

# Shares per person in each group

group3_total_shares = group3_people * group3_shares

# Step 2: Calculate the total shares (divisor)

# Step 3: Calculate the total money allocated to each group

### Explanation of Results:
- `a` is the total money received by the group of 81 people (2 shares each).
- `b` is the total money received by the group of 72 people (3 shares each).
- `c` is the total money received by the group of 63 people (4 shares each).

This code calculates the exact distribution of money among the three groups based on the given shares and number of people.
