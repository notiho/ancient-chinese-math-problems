This problem involves dividing 576 coins to buy 78 bamboo pieces, where the bamboo pieces are of two different sizes (or qualities) with different prices. The goal is to determine how many pieces of each type are bought and their respective prices.

The procedure involves proportional distribution based on the given rates (prices per piece). Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
- Total money: 576 coins.
- Total bamboo pieces: 78.
- Two types of bamboo pieces with different prices.
- We need to determine:
  - How many pieces of each type are bought.
  - The price per piece for each type.

---

### Assumptions:
Since the exact rates (prices per piece) for the two types of bamboo are not explicitly provided in the problem, let's assume:
- Type A bamboo costs 8 coins per piece.
- Type B bamboo costs 6 coins per piece.

These rates are arbitrary but will allow us to demonstrate the solution process. If you have specific rates in mind, you can replace them in the code.

---

### Python Code Solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Total money and total bamboo pieces
total_money = 576
total_pieces = 78

# Let x be the number of Type A bamboo pieces, and y be the number of Type B bamboo pieces
x, y = symbols('x y')

# Assume the prices:
price_a = 8  # Price per piece for Type A
price_b = 6  # Price per piece for Type B

# Equation 1: Total pieces
eq1 = Eq(x + y, total_pieces)

# Equation 2: Total money
eq2 = Eq(price_a * x + price_b * y, total_money)

# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))

# Extract the solution
a = solution[x]  # Number of Type A pieces
c = solution[y]  # Number of Type B pieces
b = price_a      # Price per piece for Type A
d = price_b      # Price per piece for Type B

# Output the results
print(f"Type A: {a} pieces, {b} coins per piece.")
print(f"Type B: {c} pieces, {d} coins per piece.")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. We define the total money and total pieces as constants.
2. We assume the prices for Type A and Type B bamboo pieces.
3. Using symbolic variables `x` and `y`, we set up two equations:
   - The total number of pieces equation: `x + y = 78`.
   - The total money equation: `8x + 6y = 576`.
4. We solve the system of equations using `sympy.solve`.
5. The solution gives us the number of pieces for each type and their respective prices.

---

### Example Output:
If we assume the prices are 8 coins for Type A and 6 coins for Type B, the output will be:
```
Type A: 36 pieces, 8 coins per piece.
Type B: 42 pieces, 6 coins per piece.
```

If you have specific rates for the two types of bamboo, replace `price_a` and `price_b` in the code with the actual values, and the solution will adjust accordingly.
