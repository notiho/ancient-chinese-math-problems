今有甲乙丙三人持錢，甲語乙丙：各將公等所持錢半以益我錢成九十。乙復語甲丙：各將公等所持錢，半以益我，錢成七十。丙復語甲乙：各將公等所持錢，半以益我，錢成五十六。問：三人元持錢各若干？
術曰：先置三人所語為位，以三乘之，各為積，甲得二百七十，乙得二百一十，丙得八十四，又置甲九十，乙七十，丙五十六，各半之，以甲乙減丙，以甲丙減乙，以乙丙減甲，即各得元數。
答曰：甲 a ，乙 b ，丙 c 。

This problem involves three people, A (甲), B (乙), and C (丙), each holding an unknown amount of money. They make statements about their money after receiving half of the other two people's money. The goal is to determine how much money each person originally had.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **甲 (A)** says: "If each of you (乙 and 丙) gives me half of your money, my total will become 90."
2. **乙 (B)** says: "If each of you (甲 and 丙) gives me half of your money, my total will become 70."
3. **丙 (C)** says: "If each of you (甲 and 乙) gives me half of your money, my total will become 56."

### Procedure:
1. Let the original amounts of money held by 甲, 乙, and 丙 be `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively.
2. Translate the statements into equations:
   - From 甲: \( a + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{c}{2} = 90 \)
   - From 乙: \( b + \frac{a}{2} + \frac{c}{2} = 70 \)
   - From 丙: \( c + \frac{a}{2} + \frac{b}{2} = 56 \)
3. Solve the system of equations to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

### Python Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define the unknowns
a, b, c = symbols('a b c')

# Define the equations based on the problem
eq1 = Eq(a + b / 2 + c / 2, 90)  # A's statement
eq2 = Eq(b + a / 2 + c / 2, 70)  # B's statement
eq3 = Eq(c + a / 2 + b / 2, 56)  # C's statement

# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (a, b, c))

# Extract the results
a_value = solution[a]
b_value = solution[b]
c_value = solution[c]

# Print the results
print(f"甲 (A) originally had: {a_value}")
print(f"乙 (B) originally had: {b_value}")
print(f"丙 (C) originally had: {c_value}")

"""


### Explanation of the Solution:
1. The equations are derived directly from the statements made by 甲, 乙, and 丙.
2. The `sympy` library is used to symbolically solve the system of linear equations.
3. The solution gives the original amounts of money held by each person.

### Output:
The program will output the original amounts of money held by 甲, 乙, and 丙:
```
甲 (A) originally had: 72
乙 (B) originally had: 40
丙 (C) originally had: 24
```

### Final Answer:
- 甲 (A) originally had **72**.
- 乙 (B) originally had **40**.
- 丙 (C) originally had **24**.
