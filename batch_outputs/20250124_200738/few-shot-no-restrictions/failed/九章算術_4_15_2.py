This is a classic ancient Chinese square root problem. The problem involves finding the square root of a very large number using the ancient "开方术" (square root extraction method). Below is the Python implementation of this procedure.

### Problem:
Given a total area of **3,970,215,625 bu²**, find the side length of the square field.

---

### Translation of the Procedure:
1. Place the total area as the dividend (实, "shi").
2. Borrow one digit (算步, "calculation step") and group the digits into pairs starting from the right.
3. Estimate the largest number whose square is less than or equal to the first group. This becomes the first digit of the square root.
4. Multiply the first digit by itself to form the divisor (法, "fa") and subtract it from the first group.
5. Double the current root to form the "定法" (fixed divisor). Use this to calculate the next digit of the square root.
6. Repeat the process for each group of digits until all groups are processed.
7. If the square root is not exact, express the result as a fraction.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Grouping Digits**: The digits of the area are grouped into pairs starting from the rightmost digit. This is necessary for the square root extraction process.
2. **Square Root Extraction**: The algorithm iteratively calculates each digit of the square root by estimating the largest possible digit that satisfies the condition.
3. **Fractional Part**: If the square root is not exact, the remainder is expressed as a fraction of the total area.

---

### Answer:
For the given area of **3,970,215,625 bu²**, the side length of the square field is:

**a = 63,025 bu**.
