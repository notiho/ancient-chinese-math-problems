今有五雀、六燕，集稱之衡，雀俱重，燕俱輕。一雀一燕交而處，衡適平。并燕、雀重一斤。問︰燕、雀一枚各重幾何？
術曰：如方程，交易質之，各重八兩。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：雀重 a兩 ，燕重 b兩 。

This problem involves determining the weights of sparrows and swallows based on their combined weights and balance conditions. The solution uses a system of equations, which can be solved algebraically. Here's the Python implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define variables for the weights of a sparrow and a swallow
雀 = symbols('雀')  # Weight of one sparrow in liang
燕 = symbols('燕')  # Weight of one swallow in liang

# Equation 1: One sparrow and one swallow balance each other
# This implies that the weight of one sparrow equals the weight of one swallow
Eq1 = Eq(雀 + 燕, 16)  # Combined weight of one sparrow and one swallow is 16 liang (1 jin = 16 liang)

# Equation 2: Total weight of 5 sparrows and 6 swallows is 1 jin (16 liang)
Eq2 = Eq(5 * 雀 + 6 * 燕, 16)

# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve((Eq1, Eq2), (雀, 燕))

# Extract the weights of the sparrow and the swallow
a = solution[雀]
b = solution[燕]

# Output the results
print(f"雀重 {a} 兩，燕重 {b} 兩。")
#----- content ends here -----

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Define Variables**: We define `雀` (sparrow) and `燕` (swallow) as symbolic variables representing their weights in liang.
2. **Set Up Equations**:
   - The first equation represents the condition that one sparrow and one swallow together weigh 16 liang.
   - The second equation represents the total weight of 5 sparrows and 6 swallows being 16 liang.
3. **Solve the System**: Using `sympy.solve`, we solve the system of equations to find the weights of the sparrow and the swallow.
4. **Output**: The solution is printed in terms of liang.

### Answer:
The solution to the equations gives:
- 雀重 \( a = 8 \) 兩
- 燕重 \( b = 8 \) 兩

Thus, both the sparrow and the swallow weigh **8 liang** each.
