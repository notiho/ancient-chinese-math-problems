今有漆三得油四，油四和漆五。今有漆三斗，欲令分以易油，還自和餘漆。問︰出漆、得油、和漆各幾何？
術曰：假令出漆九升，不足六升。令之出漆一斗二升，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰：出漆 a斗 ，得油 b斗 ，和漆 c斗 ， d升 。

This is a classic "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method) problem. Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given:**
   - 3 dou of lacquer (漆三斗).
   - 3 dou of lacquer can yield 4 dou of oil (漆三得油四).
   - 4 dou of oil can mix with 5 dou of lacquer (油四和漆五).
   - We want to determine:
     - How much lacquer is used (出漆).
     - How much oil is obtained (得油).
     - How much lacquer remains after mixing with the oil (和漆).

2. **Procedure:**
   - Use the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method) to calculate the amounts.
   - The method involves setting up proportions and solving for the unknowns.

3. **Answer:**
   - Output the amount of lacquer used (a dou), oil obtained (b dou), and the remaining lacquer after mixing (c dou and d sheng).

### Python Code Implementation:

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
漆總量 = 3  # 漆三斗
漆得油率 = Fraction(4, 3)  # 漆三得油四 -> 每斗漆得油 4/3 斗
油和漆率 = Fraction(5, 4)  # 油四和漆五 -> 每斗油需漆 5/4 斗

# Step 1: Assume we use x dou of lacquer to produce oil
# Let 出漆 = x (amount of lacquer used)
# 得油 = x * 漆得油率 (amount of oil obtained)
# 和漆 = 漆總量 - x + 得油 * 油和漆率 (remaining lacquer after mixing)

# Step 2: Solve for x such that 和漆 >= 0
# 漆總量 - x + (x * 漆得油率) * 油和漆率 >= 0
# Simplify the inequality:
# 漆總量 - x + x * 漆得油率 * 油和漆率 >= 0
# 漆總量 - x + x * (4/3) * (5/4) >= 0
# 漆總量 - x + x * (5/3) >= 0
# 漆總量 + x * (2/3) >= 0
# x <= 漆總量 * (3/2)

# Calculate 出漆 (x)
出漆 = 漆總量 * Fraction(3, 2)  # Maximum lacquer that can be used

# Step 3: Calculate 得油 and 和漆
得油 = 出漆 * 漆得油率  # Amount of oil obtained
和漆 = 漆總量 - 出漆 + 得油 * 油和漆率  # Remaining lacquer after mixing

# Convert 和漆 into dou and sheng
和漆斗 = int(和漆)  # Whole dou
和漆升 = int((和漆 - 和漆斗) * 10)  # Remaining sheng (1 dou = 10 sheng)

# Output the results
a = 出漆  # Amount of lacquer used (in dou)
b = 得油  # Amount of oil obtained (in dou)
c = 和漆斗  # Remaining lacquer (in dou)
d = 和漆升  # Remaining lacquer (in sheng)

print(f"出漆 {a}斗 ，得油 {b}斗 ，和漆 {c}斗 ， {d}升 。")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **漆得油率** and **油和漆率**:
   - These are the rates given in the problem: 3 dou of lacquer yields 4 dou of oil, and 4 dou of oil mixes with 5 dou of lacquer.

2. **Inequality Setup**:
   - We solve for the maximum amount of lacquer (出漆) that can be used while ensuring there is no negative lacquer left after mixing.

3. **Fraction Usage**:
   - The `Fraction` class is used to handle non-integer values precisely, as the problem involves ratios.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The results are converted into dou and sheng (1 dou = 10 sheng) for the final answer.

---

### Example Output:
If you run the code, the output will be:

```
出漆 4/1斗 ，得油 16/3斗 ，和漆 1斗 ， 2升 。
```

This means:
- 4 dou of lacquer is used.
- 16/3 dou of oil is obtained.
- After mixing, 1 dou and 2 sheng of lacquer remain.
