This problem involves finding the square root of a very large number using an ancient Chinese method for extracting square roots. The method described is iterative and involves successive approximations to determine the square root. Below is the Python implementation of this procedure:

---

### Problem:
Suppose there is an area of **3,970,215,625 bu²**.  
Question: What is the side length of the square field?

The procedure for square root extraction says:  
1. Place the area as the dividend. Borrow one digit at a time, skipping one place each time.  
2. Estimate the first digit of the root. Multiply the estimate by itself to form the divisor. Divide the dividend by the divisor.  
3. Double the divisor to form the "fixed divisor" for the next step.  
4. Repeat the process by appending the next digit to the remainder, estimating the next digit of the root, and updating the divisor.  
5. If the root cannot be extracted exactly, the result is approximate.  
6. If the area has fractional parts, convert them into a common denominator and proceed with the same method.
