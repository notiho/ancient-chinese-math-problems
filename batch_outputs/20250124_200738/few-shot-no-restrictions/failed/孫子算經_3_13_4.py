Suppose there are three people sharing a cart, leaving two carts empty.
If two people share a cart, nine people are walking.
Question: how many people and carts are there?

The procedure says: Place 2 people and multiply by 3, obtaining 6. Add the 9 people walking, obtaining 15 carts.
To find the number of people, multiply the number of carts by 2, then add the 9 people walking.

Answer: *a* carts, *b* people.
