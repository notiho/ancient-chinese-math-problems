今有望清淵，淵下有白石。偃矩岸上，令句高三尺。斜望水岸，入下股四尺五寸。望白石，入下股二尺四寸。又設重矩于上，其間相去四尺。更從句端斜望水岸，入上股四尺。以望白石，入上股二尺二寸。問水深幾何？
術曰：置望水上下股相減，餘以乘望石上股為上率。又以望石上下股相減，餘以乘望水上股為下率。兩率相減，餘以乘矩間為實；以二差相乘為法。實如法而一，得水深。
答曰： a丈 。

This is a classic problem involving geometry and proportional reasoning to calculate the depth of water based on observations using a measuring tool (矩) and the concept of similar triangles. Let's translate the problem into Python step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Data:**
   - The height of the measuring tool (矩) on the bank is 3 chi (尺).
   - Observations from the lower end of the tool:
     - Looking at the water's edge: the lower leg (股) is 4 chi 5 cun (寸).
     - Looking at the white stone: the lower leg (股) is 2 chi 4 cun.
   - Observations from the upper end of the tool (4 chi above the lower end):
     - Looking at the water's edge: the upper leg (股) is 4 chi.
     - Looking at the white stone: the upper leg (股) is 2 chi 2 cun.
   - The vertical distance between the two observation points is 4 chi.

2. **Procedure:**
   - Subtract the upper and lower legs for the water's edge to calculate the "upper rate" (上率).
   - Subtract the upper and lower legs for the white stone to calculate the "lower rate" (下率).
   - Subtract the two rates, multiply the result by the vertical distance between the observation points (矩間), and divide by the product of the two differences to find the water depth.

3. **Units:**
   - 1 chi = 10 cun.

### Python Code:

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
矩高 = 3  # Height of the measuring tool in chi
矩間 = 4  # Vertical distance between the two observation points in chi

# Observations from the lower end
望水下股 = 4 + Fraction(5, 10)  # 4 chi 5 cun
望石下股 = 2 + Fraction(4, 10)  # 2 chi 4 cun

# Observations from the upper end
望水上股 = 4  # 4 chi
望石上股 = 2 + Fraction(2, 10)  # 2 chi 2 cun

# Step 1: Calculate the upper rate (上率)
望水股差 = 望水上股 - 望水下股
上率 = 望水股差 * 望石上股

# Step 2: Calculate the lower rate (下率)
望石股差 = 望石上股 - 望石下股
下率 = 望石股差 * 望水上股

# Step 3: Calculate the difference between the rates
率差 = 上率 - 下率

# Step 4: Calculate the product of the two differences
法 = 望水股差 * 望石股差

# Step 5: Calculate the water depth
實 = 率差 * 矩間
水深 = Fraction(實, 法)

# Convert the result to zhang (丈), where 1 丈 = 10 尺
水深丈 = 水深 / 10

# Output the result
a = 水深丈
print(f"水深為 {a} 丈。")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Conversion:** All measurements are converted into fractions of chi to handle mixed units (chi and cun).
2. **Rate Calculation:** The differences between the upper and lower observations are used to calculate the upper and lower rates.
3. **Depth Calculation:** The water depth is calculated using the formula provided in the problem, ensuring all intermediate steps are followed.
4. **Unit Conversion:** The final result is converted from chi to zhang for the answer.

### Answer:
The depth of the water is `a` zhang.
