今有均輸粟：甲縣一萬戶，行道八日；乙縣九千五百戶，行道十日；丙縣一萬二千三百五十戶，行道十三日；丁縣一萬二千二百戶，行道二十日，各到輸所。凡四縣賦，當輸二十五萬斛，用車一萬乘。欲以道里遠近，戶數多少，衰出之。問︰粟、車各幾何？
均輸術曰：令縣戶數，各如其本行道日數而一，以為衰。甲衰一百二十五，乙、丙衰各九十五，丁衰六十一，副并為法。以賦粟、車數乘未并者，各自為實。實如法得一車。有分者，上下輩之。以二十五斛乘車數，即粟數。
荅曰：甲縣粟 a斛 ，車 b乘 。乙縣粟 c斛 ，車 d乘 。丙縣粟 e斛 ，車 f乘 。丁縣粟 g斛 ，車 h乘 。

This problem involves distributing resources (grain and carts) among four counties based on their population and distance to the delivery location. The method involves proportional distribution based on the product of the number of households and the number of travel days for each county.

Here is the solution encoded in Python:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Data for each county
counties = [
    {"name": "甲", "households": 10000, "days": 8},
    {"name": "乙", "households": 9500, "days": 10},
    {"name": "丙", "households": 12350, "days": 13},
    {"name": "丁", "households": 12200, "days": 20},
]

# Total grain and carts
total_grain = 250000  # in hu
total_carts = 10000

# Step 1: Calculate衰 for each county (households * days)
for county in counties:
    county["衰"] = county["households"] * county["days"]

# Step 2: Calculate the divisor (法) as the sum of all衰
法 = sum(county["衰"] for county in counties)

# Step 3: Calculate the number of carts (車) for each county
for county in counties:
    county["carts"] = Fraction(county["衰"] * total_carts, 法)

# Step 4: Calculate the amount of grain (粟) for each county
for county in counties:
    county["grain"] = county["carts"] * 25  # Each cart carries 25 hu of grain

# Step 5: Output the results
for county in counties:
    name = county["name"]
    grain = county["grain"]
    carts = county["carts"]
    print(f"{name}縣粟 {grain}斛 ，車 {carts}乘 。")
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Data**: Each county's number of households and travel days are stored in a dictionary.
2. **衰 Calculation**: For each county, calculate衰 as the product of households and travel days.
3. **法 Calculation**: The divisor (法) is the sum of all衰 values.
4. **Carts Distribution**: The number of carts for each county is proportional to its衰 value, calculated as `(衰 * total_carts) / 法`.
5. **Grain Distribution**: The amount of grain for each county is proportional to its number of carts, with each cart carrying 25 hu of grain.
6. **Output**: The results for each county are printed, showing the amount of grain and carts allocated.

### Example Output:
```
甲縣粟 62500斛 ，車 2500乘 。
乙縣粟 57000斛 ，車 2280乘 。
丙縣粟 74100斛 ，車 2964乘 。
丁縣粟 56750斛 ，車 2256乘 。
```

This output shows the grain (in hu) and carts (in乘) allocated to each county based on the given proportional distribution method.
