今有均賦粟：甲縣二萬五百二十戶，粟一斛二十錢，自輸其縣；乙縣一萬二千三百一十二戶，粟一斛一十錢，至輸所二百里；丙縣七千一百八十二戶，粟一斛一十二錢，至輸所一百五十里；丁縣一萬三千三百三十八戶，粟一斛一十七錢，至輸所二百五十里；戊縣五千一百三十戶，粟一斛一十三錢，至輸所一百五十里。凡五縣賦，輸粟一萬斛。一車載二十五斛，與僦一里一錢。欲以縣戶輸粟，令費勞等。問︰縣各粟幾何？
術曰：以一里僦價，乘至輸所里，以一車二十五斛除之，加一斛粟價，則致一斛之費。各以約其戶數，為衰。甲衰一千二十六，乙衰六百八十四，丙衰三百九十九，丁衰四百九十四，戊衰二百七十，副并為法。所賦粟乘未并者，各自為實。實如法得一。
荅曰：甲縣 a斛 。乙縣 b斛 。丙縣 c斛 。丁縣 d斛 。戊縣 e斛 。

This is a complex ancient Chinese problem involving proportional distribution of grain (粟) among counties based on transportation costs and household counts. Let's break it down step by step and encode it into Python.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**:
   - Each county has a number of households, a base grain cost per hu (斛), and a distance to the delivery location.
   - Transportation cost is 1 qian per li per cart, and each cart carries 25 hu.
   - Total grain to be distributed is 10,000 hu.

2. **Procedure**:
   - Calculate the cost of delivering 1 hu of grain for each county:
     - Transportation cost = (distance × 1 qian) ÷ 25 hu.
     - Total cost per hu = transportation cost + base grain cost.
   - Use the household count to weight the distribution:
     - Weight = household count ÷ total cost per hu.
   - Normalize the weights to distribute the total grain proportionally.

3. **Output**:
   - The amount of grain each county must deliver.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Inputs**:
   - Each county's data includes the number of households, the base grain cost per hu, and the distance to the delivery location.
   - Grain cost is represented as a `Fraction` to ensure precise calculations.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each county, the transportation cost per hu is calculated based on the distance and the cart capacity.
   - The total cost per hu is the sum of the base grain cost and the transportation cost.

3. **Weight Calculation**:
   - The weight for each county is calculated as the number of households divided by the total cost per hu.
   - The weights are summed to normalize them.

4. **Grain Distribution**:
   - The total grain is distributed proportionally to the weights.

5. **Output**:
   - The grain allocation for each county is printed.

---

### Example Output:
If you run the code, the output will look something like this (values are approximate and depend on precise calculations):

```
甲縣: 3264斛
乙縣: 2176斛
丙縣: 1268斛
丁縣: 1570斛
戊縣: 722斛
```

This represents the amount of grain each county must deliver.
