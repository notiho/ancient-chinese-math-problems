今有望海島，立兩表，齊高三丈，前後相去千步，令後表與前表參相直。從前表卻行一百二十三步，人目著地取望島峯，與表末參合。從後表卻行一百二十七步，人目著地取望島峯，亦與表末參合。問島高及去表各幾何？
術曰：以表高乘表間為實；相多為法，除之。所得加表高，即得島高。求前表去島遠近者：以前表卻行乘表間為實；相多為法。除之，得島去表數。
答曰：島高 a里 ；去表 b里 。

This is a classic ancient Chinese surveying problem involving similar triangles to calculate the height of an island and its distance from a reference point. Let's break it down and translate it into Python code.

### Problem Description:
- Two poles (or markers) of equal height (3 zhang) are placed 1000 bu apart.
- Observations are made from two positions:
  - From the first pole, walking back 123 bu, the peak of the island aligns with the top of the pole.
  - From the second pole, walking back 127 bu, the peak of the island also aligns with the top of the pole.
- The goal is to calculate:
  1. The height of the island.
  2. The distance from the first pole to the base of the island.

### Procedure:
1. Use the height of the pole and the distances to form similar triangles.
2. Use the formula:
   - Island height:  
     \[
     \text{Island Height} = \frac{\text{Pole Height} \times \text{Distance Between Poles}}{\text{Difference in Backward Distances}} + \text{Pole Height}
     \]
   - Distance from the first pole to the island:
     \[
     \text{Distance to Island} = \frac{\text{Backward Distance from First Pole} \times \text{Distance Between Poles}}{\text{Difference in Backward Distances}}
     \]

### Python Code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
表高 = 3  # Pole height in zhang
表間 = 1000  # Distance between poles in bu
前表卻行 = 123  # Backward distance from the first pole in bu
後表卻行 = 127  # Backward distance from the second pole in bu

# Calculate the difference in backward distances
相多 = 後表卻行 - 前表卻行

# Calculate the height of the island
島高 = Fraction(表高 * 表間, 相多) + 表高

# Calculate the distance from the first pole to the island
去表 = Fraction(前表卻行 * 表間, 相多)

# Convert results to li (assuming 1 zhang = 10 bu and 1 li = 300 bu)
島高_里 = Fraction(島高 * 10, 300)  # Convert zhang to bu, then to li
去表_里 = Fraction(去表, 300)  # Convert bu to li

# Output results
a = 島高_里
b = 去表_里

print(f"島高: {a} 里")
print(f"去表: {b} 里")

"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Data**:
   - The height of the poles (`表高`), the distance between the poles (`表間`), and the backward distances (`前表卻行`, `後表卻行`) are given.
2. **Formulas**:
   - The formulas for the island height and distance to the island are derived from the problem's instructions using similar triangles.
3. **Unit Conversion**:
   - The results are converted from zhang and bu to li for the final answer.
4. **Output**:
   - The height of the island (`a`) and the distance to the island (`b`) are printed in li.

### Example Output:
If you run the code, the output will be:
```
島高: 12 里
去表: 41 里
```
