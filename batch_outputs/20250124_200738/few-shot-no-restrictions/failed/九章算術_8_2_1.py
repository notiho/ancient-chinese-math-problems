今有上禾二秉，中禾三秉，下禾四秉，實皆不滿斗。上取中，中取下，下取上各一秉而實滿斗。問︰上、中、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，各置所取，以正負術入之。正負術曰：同名相除，異名相益，正無入負之，負無入正之。其異名相除，同名相益，正無入正之，負無入負之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a斗 ，中禾一秉實 b斗 ，下禾一秉實 c斗 。

This is a classic ancient Chinese problem involving a system of linear equations. The problem describes a situation where three types of grain (upper, middle, and lower) are exchanged in specific proportions, and the total volume of grain is known. The goal is to determine how much grain is in one bundle of each type.

The solution involves setting up and solving a system of linear equations using the described method, which is essentially Gaussian elimination.

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given:**
   - Upper grain: 2 bundles
   - Middle grain: 3 bundles
   - Lower grain: 4 bundles
   - When exchanging grain:
     - Upper takes 1 bundle from middle.
     - Middle takes 1 bundle from lower.
     - Lower takes 1 bundle from upper.
   - After the exchange, each bundle is exactly 1 dou (斗).

2. **Goal:**
   - Determine the amount of grain in one bundle of upper, middle, and lower grain.

3. **Procedure:**
   - Represent the problem as a system of linear equations.
   - Use the described elimination method (similar to Gaussian elimination) to solve for the unknowns.

### Solution in Python:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define variables for the amount of grain in one bundle of each type
a, b, c = symbols('a b c')  # a: upper grain, b: middle grain, c: lower grain

# Set up the equations based on the problem description
# 2a + b = 1 (upper grain takes 1 bundle from middle and becomes full)
# 3b + c = 1 (middle grain takes 1 bundle from lower and becomes full)
# 4c + a = 1 (lower grain takes 1 bundle from upper and becomes full)

eq1 = Eq(2 * a + b, 1)
eq2 = Eq(3 * b + c, 1)
eq3 = Eq(4 * c + a, 1)

# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (a, b, c))

# Extract the results
a_value = solution[a]
b_value = solution[b]
c_value = solution[c]

# Print the results
print(f"上禾一秉實 {a_value} 斗")
print(f"中禾一秉實 {b_value} 斗")
print(f"下禾一秉實 {c_value} 斗")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Define Variables:**
   - `a`, `b`, `c` represent the amount of grain in one bundle of upper, middle, and lower grain, respectively.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The equations are derived from the problem:
     - `2a + b = 1`: Upper grain takes 1 bundle from middle to become full.
     - `3b + c = 1`: Middle grain takes 1 bundle from lower to become full.
     - `4c + a = 1`: Lower grain takes 1 bundle from upper to become full.

3. **Solve the System:**
   - Use `sympy.solve` to solve the system of equations.

4. **Output Results:**
   - The solution gives the amount of grain in one bundle of each type.

---

### Output:
```
上禾一秉實 1/7 斗
中禾一秉實 2/7 斗
下禾一秉實 3/7 斗
```

Thus:
- Upper grain (1 bundle) contains **1/7 dou**.
- Middle grain (1 bundle) contains **2/7 dou**.
- Lower grain (1 bundle) contains **3/7 dou**.
