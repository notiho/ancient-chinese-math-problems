This problem describes the ancient Chinese method of square root extraction, specifically for determining the side length of a square field given its area. The procedure is quite detailed and involves iterative steps to approximate the square root. Below is the Python implementation of this method.

### Problem:
Given an area of \( 71,824 \) square bu (步), determine the side length of the square field.

---

### Translation of the Procedure:
1. Place the given area as the dividend.
2. Borrow one digit (or "step") from the dividend, skipping one place.
3. Estimate the largest number such that its square is less than or equal to the current dividend.
4. Multiply the estimated number by itself to form the divisor, and divide the dividend.
5. Double the divisor to form the "fixed divisor" for the next step.
6. Continue the process iteratively, refining the estimate.
7. If the square root cannot be determined exactly, express the result as a fraction or mixed number.

### Python Implementation:

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: The `dividend` is the given area, and `result` will store the side length of the square.
2. **Determine Place Value**: The largest place value is determined to start the iterative process.
3. **Iterative Extraction**: For each place value, the largest digit is found such that the square of the result does not exceed the dividend.
4. **Fractional Part**: If the square root is not exact, the remainder is expressed as a fraction of the original area.

---

### Example Output:
For the given area of \( 71,824 \), the program will compute the side length of the square field and output the result. If the square root is not exact, it will include the fractional part.
