今有上禾三秉，益實六斗，當下禾十秉。下禾五秉，益實一斗，當上禾二秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾三秉正，下禾一十秉負，益實六斗負。次置上禾二秉負，下禾五秉正，益實一斗負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a斗 ，下禾一秉實 b斗 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations to determine the yield (in dou) of one sheaf of "upper millet" (上禾) and one sheaf of "lower millet" (下禾). Let's break it down and solve it step by step using Python.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Relationships:**
   - 3 sheaves of upper millet (上禾) plus 6 dou equals the yield of 10 sheaves of lower millet (下禾).
   - 5 sheaves of lower millet (下禾) plus 1 dou equals the yield of 2 sheaves of upper millet (上禾).

2. **Goal:**
   - Find the yield of one sheaf of upper millet (上禾) and one sheaf of lower millet (下禾).

3. **Method:**
   - This is a system of two linear equations:
     - \( 3x - 10y = -6 \)
     - \( -2x + 5y = -1 \)
   - Solve this system using the method described in the problem, which is essentially Gaussian elimination.

### Python Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the coefficients of the equations
# Equation 1: 3x - 10y = -6
# Equation 2: -2x + 5y = -1

# Coefficients for the equations
a1, b1, c1 = 3, -10, -6  # Coefficients for the first equation
a2, b2, c2 = -2, 5, -1   # Coefficients for the second equation

# Step 1: Eliminate x from the second equation
# Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3
# to align the coefficients of x
factor1 = 2
factor2 = 3

a1, b1, c1 = a1 * factor1, b1 * factor1, c1 * factor1
a2, b2, c2 = a2 * factor2, b2 * factor2, c2 * factor2

# Subtract the second equation from the first
b_new = b1 - b2
c_new = c1 - c2

# Now we have a single equation in terms of y:
# b_new * y = c_new
y = Fraction(c_new, b_new)

# Step 2: Solve for x using the first equation
# 3x - 10y = -6
x = Fraction(-c1 - b1 * y, a1)

# Results
a = x  # Yield of one sheaf of upper millet (上禾)
b = y  # Yield of one sheaf of lower millet (下禾)

print(f"上禾一秉實 {a}斗 ，下禾一秉實 {b}斗 。")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input the equations:** The coefficients of the two equations are input as variables.
2. **Eliminate one variable:** By multiplying the equations to align the coefficients of \(x\), we eliminate \(x\) to solve for \(y\).
3. **Back-substitute:** Once \(y\) is found, substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for \(x\).
4. **Output the results:** The values of \(x\) (yield of one sheaf of upper millet) and \(y\) (yield of one sheaf of lower millet) are printed.

---

### Answer:
After running the code, the result will be:

\[
\text{上禾一秉實 } a \text{斗 ，下禾一秉實 } b \text{斗 。}
\]
