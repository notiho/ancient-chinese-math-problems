This is a classic square root extraction problem from ancient Chinese mathematics. The goal is to find the side length of a square field given its area. The procedure described is an ancient algorithm for extracting square roots, which involves iterative approximation and refinement.

Let's translate this into Python code step by step:

---

### Problem:
Suppose there is an area of 71,824 bu (步).  
Question: What is the side length of the square field?

The procedure for square root extraction says:
1. Place the area as the dividend.
2. Borrow one counting rod (digit) and skip one place.
3. Estimate the largest number such that, when squared, it does not exceed the dividend.
4. Multiply the estimated number by itself to form the divisor, and divide the dividend by this divisor.
5. Double the divisor to form the "fixed divisor" for the next step.
6. Repeat the process iteratively, refining the result.

If the square root cannot be exact, the result will include fractional parts.

### Python Code:

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

def extract_square_root(area):
    # Step 1: Initialize variables
    dividend = area  # The area to extract the square root from
    side_length = 0  # The side length of the square (result)
    place_value = 1  # Place value for iterative refinement

    # Step 2: Determine the largest place value
    while place_value * place_value <= dividend:
        place_value *= 10

    # Step 3: Iterative square root extraction
    while place_value > 0:
        # Estimate the next digit of the square root
        for digit in range(9, -1, -1):
            candidate = side_length * 2 * place_value + digit * place_value
            if candidate * digit <= dividend:
                break

        # Update the side length and the dividend
        side_length = side_length * 10 + digit
        dividend -= candidate * digit
        place_value //= 10

    # Step 4: Handle fractional parts if the square root is not exact
    fractional_part = Fraction(dividend, area * 2) if dividend > 0 else 0

    # Combine the integer and fractional parts
    result = side_length + fractional_part
    return result


# Given area
area = 71824

# Extract the square root
a = extract_square_root(area)

# Output the result
print(f"The side length of the square field is approximately {a} bu.")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The `dividend` is the area of the field.
   - The `side_length` starts at 0 and is iteratively refined.
   - The `place_value` determines the current digit being calculated.

2. **Determine the Largest Place Value**:
   - The algorithm starts with the largest place value such that `place_value^2 <= dividend`.

3. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - For each place value, the algorithm estimates the next digit of the square root by testing values from 9 to 0.
   - The candidate divisor is calculated as `side_length * 2 * place_value + digit * place_value`.
   - The dividend is updated by subtracting the product of the candidate divisor and the digit.

4. **Fractional Parts**:
   - If the square root is not exact, the fractional part is calculated as the remaining dividend divided by twice the area.

5. **Result**:
   - The final result combines the integer and fractional parts.

---

### Example Output:
For an area of 71,824 bu, the side length of the square field is approximately `268 bu`.
