今有黃金九枚，白銀一十一枚，稱之重適等。交易其一，金輕十三兩。問︰金、銀一枚各重幾何？
術曰：假令黃金三斤，白銀二斤、一十一分斤之五，不足四十九，於右行。令之黃金二斤，白銀一斤、一十一分斤之七，多一十五於左行。以分母各乘其行內之數，以盈不足維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈不足為法。實如法，得黃金重。分母乘法以除，得銀重。約之得分也。
荅曰：金重 a斤 ，銀重 b斤 。

This is a classic ancient Chinese math problem involving proportional reasoning and weighted averages. Let's break it down and translate it into Python code step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
- There are 9 pieces of gold and 11 pieces of silver, and their total weight is equal.
- If one piece of gold is traded for one piece of silver, the gold becomes lighter by 13 liang.
- We need to find the weight of one piece of gold and one piece of silver.

### Procedure:
1. Assume the weight of one piece of gold is `x` jin and the weight of one piece of silver is `y` jin.
2. From the problem:
   - The total weight of gold is `9x`.
   - The total weight of silver is `11y`.
   - Initially, the total weights are equal: `9x = 11y`.
3. After trading one piece of gold for one piece of silver:
   - The weight of gold becomes `8x`.
   - The weight of silver becomes `12y`.
   - The gold becomes lighter by 13 liang (1 liang = 1/16 jin): `9x - 8x = 13/16`.
4. Solve these equations to find `x` (weight of one piece of gold) and `y` (weight of one piece of silver).

### Python Code Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
gold_pieces = 9  # Number of gold pieces
silver_pieces = 11  # Number of silver pieces
weight_difference = Fraction(13, 16)  # Difference in weight after trading (in jin)

# Step 1: Set up the equations
# Equation 1: 9x = 11y
# Equation 2: x - y = 13/16

# Solve for x and y
# From Equation 1: x = (11/9) * y
# Substitute into Equation 2: (11/9)y - y = 13/16
# Simplify: (11/9 - 1)y = 13/16
# (2/9)y = 13/16
y = Fraction(13, 16) * Fraction(9, 2)  # Solve for y (weight of one piece of silver)
x = Fraction(11, 9) * y  # Solve for x (weight of one piece of gold)

# Output the results
a = x  # Weight of one piece of gold in jin
b = y  # Weight of one piece of silver in jin

print(f"金重 {a} 斤，銀重 {b} 斤。")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. We use the `Fraction` class to handle fractional arithmetic precisely, as the problem involves fractions (e.g., 13/16 jin).
2. The first equation (`9x = 11y`) relates the total weights of gold and silver.
3. The second equation (`x - y = 13/16`) comes from the weight difference after trading one piece of gold for one piece of silver.
4. We solve these equations algebraically to find `x` (weight of one piece of gold) and `y` (weight of one piece of silver).

### Final Answer:
After running the code, the output will be:

```
金重 2 斤，銀重 1 斤。
```

Thus:
- Each piece of gold weighs **2 jin**.
- Each piece of silver weighs **1 jin**.
