This problem involves calculating the total number of items in a square bundle of objects, given that the outer perimeter of the square contains 32 items. The procedure involves a specific algorithm to determine the total count.

### Problem Breakdown:
- The outer perimeter of the square contains 32 items.
- The goal is to calculate the total number of items in the square.

### Procedure:
1. **重置二位**: Split the number into two digits (left and right positions).
2. **左位減八**: Subtract 8 from the left digit.
3. **餘加右位**: Add the remainder to the right digit.
4. **至盡虛加一**: Repeat the process until no digits remain, then add 1 to the result.

### Python Implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

# Outer perimeter of the square
outer_perimeter = 32

# Step 1: Calculate the side length of the square
# The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length
side_length = outer_perimeter // 4

# Step 2: Calculate the total number of items in the square
# The total number of items in the square is the side length squared
total_items = side_length ** 2

# Answer
a = total_items
print(f"Total items in the square: {a} 枚")
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. The outer perimeter of the square is given as 32.
2. The side length of the square is calculated as `outer_perimeter // 4`, which gives 8.
3. The total number of items in the square is the square of the side length, i.e., `8 ** 2 = 64`.

### Final Answer:
The total number of items in the square is **64 枚**.
