假令有粟三千七十二石，欲作方倉一、圓窖一，令徑與方等，方於窖深二尺，少於倉高三尺，盛各滿中而粟適盡。問：方、徑、高、深各多少？
術曰：三十五乘粟，二十五而一，為率。多自乘，以並多少乘之，以乘一十四，如二十五而一，所得以減率，余為實。並多少，以乘多，倍之，乘一十四，如二十五而一，多自乘加之，為方法。又並多少，以乘一十四，如二十五而一，加多加之，為廉法，從。開立方除之，即窖深。各加差，即方、徑、高。
答曰：方徑各 a丈 ，高 b丈 ，深 c丈 。

This is a complex ancient Chinese mathematical problem involving the calculation of dimensions for a square granary and a circular pit, given specific relationships between their dimensions and the total volume of grain. Let's break this down into Python code step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given**:
   - Total grain: 3072 石.
   - The square granary and circular pit must have the same width (side of the square = diameter of the circle).
   - The square granary is 2 尺 deeper than the circular pit.
   - The square granary is 3 尺 shorter in height than the circular pit.
   - Both are filled to capacity, and the grain is exactly used up.

2. **Procedure**:
   - Use the formula provided in the problem to calculate the depth of the circular pit (`窖深`).
   - Use the relationships between the dimensions to calculate the side of the square (`方`), the diameter of the circle (`徑`), the height of the square granary (`高`), and the depth of the circular pit (`深`).

3. **Answer**:
   - Output the dimensions: side/diameter (`a` 丈), height (`b` 丈), and depth (`c` 丈).

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction
from math import pow

# Given data
粟 = 3072  # Total grain in 石
差 = Fraction(2, 10)  # Difference between square granary depth and circular pit depth (2 尺 = 2/10 丈)
差高 = Fraction(3, 10)  # Difference between circular pit height and square granary height (3 尺 = 3/10 丈)

# Constants in the formula
三十五 = 35
二十五 = 25
一十四 = 14

# Step 1: Calculate the rate (率)
率 = Fraction(三十五 * 粟, 二十五)

# Step 2: Calculate the "method for the square" (方法)
多 = 差 + 差高
方法 = 多**2 + 2 * 多 * 差 + 差**2

# Step 3: Calculate the "method for the edge" (廉法)
廉法 = 2 * 多 + 差

# Step 4: Solve for the depth of the circular pit (窖深)
窖深 = pow(float(率 / 方法), 1/3)

# Step 5: Calculate the dimensions
深 = Fraction(窖深)  # Depth of the circular pit
方 = 深 + 差  # Side of the square granary
徑 = 方  # Diameter of the circular pit (equal to the side of the square granary)
高 = 深 + 差高  # Height of the circular pit

# Convert to 丈 for the final answer
a = 方
b = 高
c = 深

# Output the results
print(f"方徑各 {a} 丈, 高 {b} 丈, 深 {c} 丈.")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Conversion**:
   - The differences in depth and height are converted from 尺 to 丈 (1 丈 = 10 尺).

2. **Rate Calculation**:
   - The rate (`率`) is calculated using the formula `35 * 粟 / 25`.

3. **Formula Application**:
   - The "method for the square" (`方法`) and "method for the edge" (`廉法`) are calculated using the relationships provided in the problem.

4. **Depth Calculation**:
   - The depth of the circular pit (`窖深`) is calculated by solving the cubic equation using the cube root.

5. **Dimension Calculation**:
   - The side of the square granary (`方`), diameter of the circular pit (`徑`), height of the square granary (`高`), and depth of the circular pit (`深`) are calculated using the relationships provided.

6. **Output**:
   - The results are printed in 丈.

### Final Answer:
The dimensions of the square granary and circular pit are:
- Side/Diameter (`a`): Calculated value in 丈.
- Height (`b`): Calculated value in 丈.
- Depth (`c`): Calculated value in 丈.

This code provides a step-by-step solution to the problem using Python.
