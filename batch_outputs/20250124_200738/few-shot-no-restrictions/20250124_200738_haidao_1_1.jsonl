Let's break it down step by step and translate it into Python code.\n\n### Problem Explanation:\nWe are tasked with determining the north-south length and east-west width of a city (\u9091) located south of a mountain. The problem involves using a surveying tool called a \"\u77e9\" (a carpenter's square) and measurements of distances and angles. The procedure involves several steps of geometric calculations.\n\n### Variables:\n- **\u53e5\u9ad8**: The height of the vertical leg of the square (3 chi 5 cun = 3.5 chi).\n- **\u77e9\u9593**: The distance between the two squares (4 zhang = 40 chi).\n- **\u6771\u5317\u9685\u5165\u4e0b\u80a1**: The distance from the northeast corner to the lower leg (1 zhang 2 chi = 12 chi).\n- **\u6771\u5357\u9685\u5165\u4e0b\u80a1**: The distance from the southeast corner to the lower leg (1 zhang 8 chi = 18 chi).\n- **\u5165\u6a6b\u53e5**: The distance from the northwest corner to the horizontal leg (5 chi).\n- **\u6771\u5357\u9685\u5165\u4e0a\u80a1**: The distance from the southeast corner to the upper leg (1 zhang 7 chi 5 cun = 17.5 chi).\n\n### Procedure:\n1. **Calculate the north-south length (\u5357\u5317\u9577):**\n   - Multiply the height of the vertical leg (\u53e5\u9ad8) by the southeast corner's lower leg distance (\u6771\u5357\u9685\u5165\u4e0b\u80a1).\n   - Divide the result by the upper leg distance (\u6771\u5357\u9685\u5165\u4e0a\u80a1) and subtract the height of the vertical leg (\u53e5\u9ad8).\n   - Use the difference between the northeast and southeast lower leg distances to calculate the actual length.\n\n2. **Calculate the east-west width (\u6771\u897f\u5ee3):**\n   - Multiply the horizontal leg distance (\u5165\u6a6b\u53e5) by the distance between the two squares (\u77e9\u9593).\n   - Divide the result by the height of the vertical leg (\u53e5\u9ad8).\n\n---\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Given values\n\u53e5\u9ad8 = Fraction(35, 10)  # 3 chi 5 cun = 3.5 chi\n\u77e9\u9593 = 40  # 4 zhang = 40 chi\n\u6771\u5317\u9685\u5165\u4e0b\u80a1 = 12  # 1 zhang 2 chi = 12 chi\n\u6771\u5357\u9685\u5165\u4e0b\u80a1 = 18  # 1 zhang 8 chi = 18 chi\n\u5165\u6a6b\u53e5 = 5  # 5 chi\n\u6771\u5357\u9685\u5165\u4e0a\u80a1 = Fraction(175, 10)  # 1 zhang 7 chi 5 cun = 17.5 chi\n\n# Step 1: Calculate \u5357\u5317\u9577 (north-south length)\n# \u6cd5 = (\u53e5\u9ad8 * \u6771\u5357\u9685\u5165\u4e0b\u80a1) / \u6771\u5357\u9685\u5165\u4e0a\u80a1 - \u53e5\u9ad8\n\u6cd5 = (\u53e5\u9ad8 * \u6771\u5357\u9685\u5165\u4e0b\u80a1) / \u6771\u5357\u9685\u5165\u4e0a\u80a1 - \u53e5\u9ad8\n\n# \u5be6 = (\u6771\u5317\u9685\u5165\u4e0b\u80a1 - \u6771\u5357\u9685\u5165\u4e0b\u80a1) * \u77e9\u9593\n\u5be6_\u5357\u5317 = (\u6771\u5317\u9685\u5165\u4e0b\u80a1 - \u6771\u5357\u9685\u5165\u4e0b\u80a1) * \u77e9\u9593\n\n# \u5357\u5317\u9577 = \u5be6 / \u6cd5\n\u5357\u5317\u9577 = \u5be6_\u5357\u5317 / \u6cd5\n\n# Step 2: Calculate \u6771\u897f\u5ee3 (east-west width)\n# \u6cd5 = \u53e5\u9ad8\n\u6cd5_\u6771\u897f = \u53e5\u9ad8\n\n# \u5be6 = \u5165\u6a6b\u53e5 * \u77e9\u9593\n\u5be6_\u6771\u897f = \u5165\u6a6b\u53e5 * \u77e9\u9593\n\n# \u6771\u897f\u5ee3 = \u5be6 / \u6cd5\n\u6771\u897f\u5ee3 = \u5be6_\u6771\u897f / \u6cd5_\u6771\u897f\n\n# Convert chi to li (1 li = 300 chi)\n\u5357\u5317\u9577_\u91cc = \u5357\u5317\u9577 / 300\n\u6771\u897f\u5ee3_\u91cc = \u6771\u897f\u5ee3 / 300\n\n# Final results\na = \u5357\u5317\u9577_\u91cc\nb = \u6771\u897f\u5ee3_\u91cc\n\nprint(f\"\u5357\u5317\u9577: {a} \u91cc\")\nprint(f\"\u6771\u897f\u5ee3: {b} \u91cc\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Step 1 (\u5357\u5317\u9577):**\n   - The formula for the north-south length is derived from the relationship between the height of the square, the distances to the lower and upper legs, and the difference between the northeast and southeast distances.\n   - The divisor (`\u6cd5`) is calculated first, followed by the dividend (`\u5be6`), and then the length is obtained by dividing the two.\n\n2. **Step 2 (\u6771\u897f\u5ee3):**\n   - The formula for the east-west width is simpler, involving only the horizontal leg distance and the distance between the two squares.\n\n3. **Unit Conversion:**\n   - Since the original measurements are in chi, we convert the final results into li (1 li = 300 chi).\n\n---\n\n### Output:\nThe program will output the north-south length and east-west width of the city in li:\n```\n\u5357\u5317\u9577: a \u91cc\n\u6771\u897f\u5ee3: b \u91cc\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2011, "completion_tokens": 5420, "total_tokens": 7431, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ec7eab8ec3"}}, "error": null}
