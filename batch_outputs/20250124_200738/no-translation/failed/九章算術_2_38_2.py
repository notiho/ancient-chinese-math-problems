今有出錢一千一百二十，買絲一石二鈞十八斤。欲其貴賤斤率之，問︰各幾何？
其率術曰：各置所買石、鈞、斤、兩以為法，以所率乘錢數為實，實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法賤實貴。
荅曰：其 a鈞 ，斤 b錢 。其 c石 ，斤 d錢 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step according to the procedure described in the problem:

1. **Given Data**:
   - 出錢 (total money spent): 1120
   - 買絲 (silk purchased): 1 石 (shi), 2 鈞 (jun), 18 斤 (jin)

2. **Procedure**:
   - Each unit (石, 鈞, 斤) is treated as a "法" (denominator).
   - Multiply the total money by the respective unit to calculate the "實" (numerator).
   - Divide the "實" by the "法" to find the rate per unit.
   - If the result is less than the "法," adjust accordingly.

Now, let's encode this into Python step by step.

斤_per_石 = 300  # 1 石 = 300 斤

# Total weight in 斤
total_斤 = 石 * 斤_per_石 + 鈞 * 斤_per_鈞 + 斤

# Calculate rates
rate_per_斤 = Fraction(total_money, total_斤)  # 貴賤斤率

# Rates for 鈞 and 石
rate_per_鈞 = rate_per_斤 * 斤_per_鈞
rate_per_石 = rate_per_斤 * 斤_per_石

# Results
a = rate_per_鈞  # 鈞 rate in money
b = rate_per_斤  # 斤 rate in money
c = rate_per_石  # 石 rate in money
d = rate_per_斤  # 斤 rate in money

# Output
a, b, c, d

### Explanation of Results:
- `a` is the rate per 鈞 in money.
- `b` is the rate per 斤 in money.
- `c` is the rate per 石 in money.
- `d` is the rate per 斤 in money (same as `b`).

This code calculates the rates for each unit (石, 鈞, 斤) based on the total money spent and the total weight of silk purchased.
