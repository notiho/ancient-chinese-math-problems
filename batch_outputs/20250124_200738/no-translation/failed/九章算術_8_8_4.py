今有五雀、六燕，集稱之衡，雀俱重，燕俱輕。一雀一燕交而處，衡適平。并燕、雀重一斤。問︰燕、雀一枚各重幾何？
術曰：如方程，交易質之，各重八兩。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：雀重 a兩 ，燕重 b兩 。

To solve this problem, we will use the given procedure and translate it into Python code. The problem essentially involves solving a system of linear equations based on the weights of sparrows (雀) and swallows (燕). Here's the step-by-step translation:

---

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given**:
   - 5 sparrows (雀) and 6 swallows (燕) together weigh 1斤 (16兩).
   - 1 sparrow and 1 swallow together balance the scale (equal weight).

2. **Objective**:
   - Find the weight of one sparrow (雀) and one swallow (燕) in 兩.

3. **Procedure**:
   - Use the method of solving linear equations as described in the 方程術.

### Python Code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the equations based on the problem:
# Let x = weight of one sparrow (雀) in 兩
# Let y = weight of one swallow (燕) in 兩

# Equation 1: 5x + 6y = 16 (total weight in 斤 converted to 兩)
total_weight = 16  # 1斤 = 16兩
eq1_coeff_sparrow = 5
eq1_coeff_swallow = 6

# Equation 2: x = y (1 sparrow and 1 swallow balance the scale)
eq2_coeff_sparrow = 1
eq2_coeff_swallow = 1

# Solve the equations using the 方程術:

# Step 1: Express y in terms of x from Equation 2
# x = y
y = Fraction(1, 1) * eq2_coeff_sparrow  # y = x

# Step 2: Substitute y into Equation 1
# 5x + 6y = 16 becomes 5x + 6x = 16
combined_coeff = eq1_coeff_sparrow + eq1_coeff_swallow  # 5 + 6 = 11
x = Fraction(total_weight, combined_coeff)  # x = 16 / 11

# Step 3: Solve for y using x = y
y = x  # From Equation 2

# Results:
a = x  # Weight of one sparrow in 兩
b = y  # Weight of one swallow in 兩

# Output the results
a, b

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Equation Setup**:
   - The first equation represents the total weight of 5 sparrows and 6 swallows.
   - The second equation represents the balance condition (1 sparrow = 1 swallow).

2. **Substitution**:
   - Using the second equation, we substitute `y` (weight of a swallow) with `x` (weight of a sparrow).

3. **Solve for `x`**:
   - Combine the coefficients of `x` and solve for its value.

4. **Solve for `y`**:
   - Since `x = y`, the weight of a swallow is the same as the weight of a sparrow.

---

### Final Answer:
- `a = 8`兩 (weight of one sparrow)
- `b = 8`兩 (weight of one swallow)
