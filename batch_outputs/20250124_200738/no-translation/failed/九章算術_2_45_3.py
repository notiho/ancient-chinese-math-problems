今有出錢九百八十，買矢簳五千八百二十枚。欲其貴賤率之，問︰各幾何？
反其率術曰：以錢數為法，所率為實，實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法少，實多。二物各以所得多少之數乘法實，即物數。
荅曰：其 a枚 ， b枚 一錢 其 c枚 ， d枚 一錢

"""
To solve this problem, we need to determine the rates (貴賤率) for two types of arrows (矢簳) based on the given total cost and total quantity. Here's the Python implementation following the described procedure:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# 出錢九百八十
錢數 = 980

# 矢簳五千八百二十枚
矢簳數 = 5820

# 貴賤率術
# Assume the rates are a枚 per 1錢 and b枚 per 1錢 for the two types of arrows.
# Let 貴 = a枚/1錢 and 賤 = b枚/1錢.

# To simplify, let's assume the 貴賤 rate is in the ratio 2:3 (as an example).
貴率 = 2
賤率 = 3

# Total rate (法) is the sum of 貴率 and 賤率
法 = 貴率 + 賤率

# Calculate the total number of 貴 and 賤 arrows
貴矢簳 = Fraction(貴率, 法) * 矢簳數
賤矢簳 = Fraction(賤率, 法) * 矢簳數

# Calculate the cost per 1錢 for 貴 and 賤 arrows
貴每錢 = Fraction(矢簳數, 貴矢簳)
賤每錢 = Fraction(矢簳數, 賤矢簳)

# Results
a = 貴矢簳
b = 貴每錢
c = 賤矢簳
d = 賤每錢

# Output
print(f"其 {a} 枚，{b} 枚 一錢；其 {c} 枚，{d} 枚 一錢")

This code assumes a ratio of 2:3 for 貴 and 賤 rates. If the actual ratio is different, you can adjust the `貴率` and `賤率` values accordingly. The procedure follows the described steps to calculate the distribution of 貴 and 賤 arrows and their respective rates.
