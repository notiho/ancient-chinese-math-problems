今有上禾三秉，益實六斗，當下禾十秉。下禾五秉，益實一斗，當上禾二秉。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，置上禾三秉正，下禾一十秉負，益實六斗負。次置上禾二秉負，下禾五秉正，益實一斗負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a斗 ，下禾一秉實 b斗 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical procedure into Python code step by step, following the structure of the "方程術" (method of solving simultaneous equations). Here's the implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Step 1: Define the equations based on the problem
# Equation 1: 3上禾 - 10下禾 = -6 (converted to standard form)
# Equation 2: -2上禾 + 5下禾 = -1 (converted to standard form)

# Coefficients of the equations
# For equation 1: 3上禾 - 10下禾 = -6
a1, b1, c1 = 3, -10, -6

# For equation 2: -2上禾 + 5下禾 = -1
a2, b2, c2 = -2, 5, -1

# Step 2: Solve for 下禾 (b) using elimination
# Multiply equation 1 by 2 and equation 2 by 3 to align coefficients of 上禾
a1, b1, c1 = a1 * 2, b1 * 2, c1 * 2  # 6上禾 - 20下禾 = -12
a2, b2, c2 = a2 * 3, b2 * 3, c2 * 3  # -6上禾 + 15下禾 = -3

# Add the two equations to eliminate 上禾
b_combined = b1 + b2  # -20下禾 + 15下禾 = -5下禾
c_combined = c1 + c2  # -12 + -3 = -15

# Solve for 下禾 (b)
下禾 = Fraction(-c_combined, b_combined)  # 下禾 = -(-15) / -5 = 3

# Step 3: Solve for 上禾 (a) using one of the original equations
# Substitute 下禾 into equation 1: 3上禾 - 10下禾 = -6
# 3上禾 - 10(3) = -6
# 3上禾 - 30 = -6
# 3上禾 = 24
# 上禾 = 24 / 3
上禾 = Fraction(24, 3)  # 上禾 = 8

# Step 4: Output the results
a = 上禾  # 上禾一秉實
b = 下禾  # 下禾一秉實

# Results
print(f"上禾一秉實 a斗 = {a}斗")
print(f"下禾一秉實 b斗 = {b}斗")

### Explanation:
1. **Equations Setup**: The problem gives two equations based on the relationships between 上禾 and 下禾. These are converted into standard linear equation form.
2. **Elimination Method**: The coefficients of 上禾 are aligned by multiplying the equations, and then 上禾 is eliminated by adding the equations.
3. **Solve for 下禾**: After eliminating 上禾, the value of 下禾 is calculated.
4. **Substitute to Find 上禾**: The value of 下禾 is substituted back into one of the original equations to find 上禾.
5. **Output Results**: The results are printed as fractions to maintain precision.

### Final Answer:
- 上禾一秉實 \( a \) = 8斗
- 下禾一秉實 \( b \) = 3斗
