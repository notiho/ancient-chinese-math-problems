今有甲禾二秉、乙禾三秉、丙禾四秉，重皆過於石。甲二重如乙一，乙三重如丙一，丙四重如甲一。問︰甲、乙、丙禾一秉各重幾何？
術曰：如方程，置重過於石之物為負。以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：甲禾一秉重 a石 ，乙禾一秉重 b石 ，丙禾一秉重 c石 。

To solve this problem, we will use the ancient Chinese method of solving simultaneous equations, as described in the "方程術" (method of equations). The problem involves three types of grain (甲, 乙, 丙) with weights that are related proportionally. Let's translate the procedure into Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
甲禾秉數 = 2  # Two bundles of 甲
乙禾秉數 = 3  # Three bundles of 乙
丙禾秉數 = 4  # Four bundles of 丙
總重 = 39  # Total weight in 斗

# Weight relationships:
# 甲二重如乙一 (2甲 = 1乙)
# 乙三重如丙一 (3乙 = 1丙)
# 丙四重如甲一 (4丙 = 1甲)

# Step 1: Express the relationships as equations
# Let x = weight of 甲禾 per bundle
# Let y = weight of 乙禾 per bundle
# Let z = weight of 丙禾 per bundle

# From the relationships:
# 2x = y  => y = 2x
# 3y = z  => z = 3y = 6x
# 4z = x  => x = 4z = 24x (This creates a proportional system)

# Step 2: Solve the system of equations
# Total weight equation: 2x + 3y + 4z = 39
# Substitute y = 2x and z = 6x into the total weight equation:
# 2x + 3(2x) + 4(6x) = 39
# 2x + 6x + 24x = 39
# 32x = 39
x = Fraction(39, 32)  # Weight of 甲禾 per bundle

# Calculate y and z using the relationships
y = 2 * x  # Weight of 乙禾 per bundle
z = 6 * x  # Weight of 丙禾 per bundle

# Results
a = x  # Weight of 甲禾 per bundle in 石
b = y  # Weight of 乙禾 per bundle in 石
c = z  # Weight of 丙禾 per bundle in 石

# Output
a, b, c

"""


### Explanation:
1. The relationships between the weights are expressed as equations.
2. These equations are substituted into the total weight equation to solve for `x` (weight of 甲禾 per bundle).
3. Using the solved value of `x`, the weights of 乙禾 (`y`) and 丙禾 (`z`) are calculated.
4. The results are expressed as fractions to maintain precision.

### Answer:
- 甲禾一秉重 `a = 39/32` 石
- 乙禾一秉重 `b = 78/32` 石
- 丙禾一秉重 `c = 234/32` 石
