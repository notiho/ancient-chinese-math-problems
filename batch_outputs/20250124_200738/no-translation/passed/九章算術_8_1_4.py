今有上禾七秉，損實一斗，益之下禾二秉，而實一十斗。下禾八秉，益實一斗與上禾二秉，而實一十斗。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程。損之曰益，益之曰損。損實一斗者，其實過一十斗也。益實一斗者，其實不滿一十斗也。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a斗 ，下禾一秉實 b斗 。

To solve this problem using the described procedure, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical method into Python code. The problem involves solving a system of linear equations based on the relationships between the quantities of "上禾" (upper grain) and "下禾" (lower grain). Here's the Python implementation:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the equations based on the problem description:
# Equation 1: 7 * 上禾 - 1 + 2 * 下禾 = 10
# Equation 2: 8 * 下禾 + 1 + 2 * 上禾 = 10

# Rewrite the equations to isolate the constants on the right-hand side:
# 7 * 上禾 + 2 * 下禾 = 11
# 2 * 上禾 + 8 * 下禾 = 9

# Coefficients of the equations
a1, b1, c1 = 7, 2, 11  # Coefficients for the first equation
a2, b2, c2 = 2, 8, 9   # Coefficients for the second equation

# Solve for 下禾 (lower grain) first:
# Multiply the first equation by b2 and the second equation by b1 to align the 下禾 coefficients
# b2 * (a1 * 上禾 + b1 * 下禾) = b2 * c1
# b1 * (a2 * 上禾 + b2 * 下禾) = b1 * c2

# Eliminate 下禾 by subtracting the two equations:
numerator_上禾 = b2 * c1 - b1 * c2
denominator_上禾 = b2 * a1 - b1 * a2
上禾 = Fraction(numerator_上禾, denominator_上禾)

# Substitute 上禾 back into one of the original equations to solve for 下禾:
numerator_下禾 = c1 - a1 * 上禾
denominator_下禾 = b1
下禾 = Fraction(numerator_下禾, denominator_下禾)

# Results:
a = 上禾  # 上禾一秉實
b = 下禾  # 下禾一秉實

# Output the results
a, b

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Equations Setup**: The problem provides two equations based on the relationships between "上禾" and "下禾". These equations are rewritten in standard linear form.
2. **Elimination Method**: The elimination method is used to solve the system of equations. First, we eliminate one variable (下禾) to solve for the other (上禾).
3. **Substitution**: Once "上禾" is found, it is substituted back into one of the original equations to solve for "下禾".
4. **Fraction Class**: The `Fraction` class is used to ensure precise arithmetic with rational numbers.

### Final Answer:
- `a` represents the amount of grain per秉 for "上禾".
- `b` represents the amount of grain per秉 for "下禾".
