今有上禾七秉，損實一斗，益之下禾二秉，而實一十斗。下禾八秉，益實一斗與上禾二秉，而實一十斗。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程。損之曰益，益之曰損。損實一斗者，其實過一十斗也。益實一斗者，其實不滿一十斗也。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a斗 ，下禾一秉實 b斗 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical procedure into Python code step by step. The problem involves solving a system of linear equations using the described method.

The equations derived from the problem are as follows:
1. \( 7x - 1 + 2y = 10 \)
2. \( 8y + 1 + 2x = 10 \)

Where \( x \) is the amount of grain per秉 (unit) of 上禾 (upper grain), and \( y \) is the amount of grain per秉 (unit) of 下禾 (lower grain).

We will now implement the solution using the described procedure.

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the coefficients of the equations
# Equation 1: 7x - 1 + 2y = 10
# Rearranged: 7x + 2y = 11

# Equation 2: 8y + 1 + 2x = 10
# Rearranged: 2x + 8y = 9
a2, b2, c2 = 2, 8, 9

# Step 1: Eliminate x by multiplying the equations and subtracting
# Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 7
# This makes the coefficients of x in both equations equal

mult2 = 7

new_b1 = b1 * mult1
new_c1 = c1 * mult1

new_a2 = a2 * mult2
new_b2 = b2 * mult2
new_c2 = c2 * mult2

# Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate x
b_final = new_b1 - new_b2
c_final = new_c1 - new_c2

# Solve for y
y = Fraction(c_final, b_final)

# Step 2: Substitute y back into one of the original equations to solve for x
# Using the first equation: 7x + 2y = 11
x = Fraction(c1 - b1 * y, a1)

# Results
a = x  # 上禾一秉實
b = y  # 下禾一秉實

# Output the results

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Define the equations**: The coefficients of the equations are extracted from the problem statement.
2. **Eliminate one variable**: By multiplying the equations to make the coefficients of \( x \) equal, we can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate \( x \).
3. **Solve for the remaining variable**: After eliminating \( x \), we solve for \( y \).
4. **Back-substitute**: Substitute \( y \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( x \).
5. **Output the results**: The values of \( x \) and \( y \) represent the grain per秉 for 上禾 and 下禾, respectively.

### Final Answer:
- \( a \): The grain per秉 for 上禾.
- \( b \): The grain per秉 for 下禾.
