Suppose 3 days, and the progress exceeds 3 chi 7.5 cun.\nThe procedure for excess and deficiency says: Place the rates of progress, with the excess and deficiency below them.\nMultiply the rates of progress by their respective excess or deficiency, and add them to form the dividend.\nAdd the excess and deficiency to form the divisor.\nDivide the dividend by the divisor to obtain the result. If there is a fraction, simplify it.\nFor the excess and deficiency, if they are related to the same object, place the rates of progress, subtract the smaller from the larger, and simplify the dividend and divisor.\nThe dividend becomes the value of the object, and the divisor becomes the number of people.\n\nAnswer: *a*(=36/17) days. The large mouse digs *b*(=59/17) chi, and the small mouse digs *c*(=26/17) chi.\n\"\"\"\n\n# \u57a3\u539a\u4e94\u5c3a\n\u57a3\u539a = 5\n\n# \u5927\u9f20\u65e5\u4e00\u5c3a\uff0c\u5c0f\u9f20\u4ea6\u65e5\u4e00\u5c3a\n\u5927\u9f20\u65e5\u9032 = 1\n\u5c0f\u9f20\u65e5\u9032 = 1\n\n# \u5927\u9f20\u65e5\u81ea\u500d\uff0c\u5c0f\u9f20\u65e5\u81ea\u534a\n\u5927\u9f20\u9032\u7387 = [1, 2, 4]  # Progression: 1 chi, 2 chi, 4 chi, etc.\n\u5c0f\u9f20\u9032\u7387 = [1, Fraction(1, 2), Fraction(1, 4)]  # Progression: 1 chi, 1/2 chi, 1/4 chi, etc.\n\n# \u5047\u4ee4\u4e8c\u65e5\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e94\u5bf8\n\u4e0d\u8db3 = Fraction(5, 10)  # 5 cun = 5/10 chi\n\u5927\u9f20\u4e8c\u65e5 = sum(\u5927\u9f20\u9032\u7387[:2])  # Large mouse's progress in 2 days\n\u5c0f\u9f20\u4e8c\u65e5 = sum(\u5c0f\u9f20\u9032\u7387[:2])  # Small mouse's progress in 2 days\n\u4e8c\u65e5\u7e3d\u9032 = \u5927\u9f20\u4e8c\u65e5 + \u5c0f\u9f20\u4e8c\u65e5  # Total progress in 2 days\n\u4e8c\u65e5\u4e0d\u8db3 = \u57a3\u539a - \u4e8c\u65e5\u7e3d\u9032  # Deficiency after 2 days\n\n# \u4ee4\u4e4b\u4e09\u65e5\uff0c\u6709\u9918\u4e09\u5c3a\u4e03\u5bf8\u534a\n\u6709\u9918 = 3 + Fraction(7, 10)  # 3 chi 7.5 cun = 3 + 7/10 chi\n\u5927\u9f20\u4e09\u65e5 = sum(\u5927\u9f20\u9032\u7387[:3])  # Large mouse's progress in 3 days\n\u5c0f\u9f20\u4e09\u65e5 = sum(\u5c0f\u9f20\u9032\u7387[:3])  # Small mouse's progress in 3 days\n\u4e09\u65e5\u7e3d\u9032 = \u5927\u9f20\u4e09\u65e5 + \u5c0f\u9f20\u4e09\u65e5  # Total progress in 3 days\n\u4e09\u65e5\u6709\u9918 = \u4e09\u65e5\u7e3d\u9032 - \u57a3\u539a  # Excess after 3 days\n\n# \u76c8\u4e0d\u8db3\u8853\n\u76c8 = \u4e09\u65e5\u6709\u9918  # Excess\n\u4e0d\u8db3 = \u4e8c\u65e5\u4e0d\u8db3  # Deficiency\n\u5927\u9f20\u7387 = \u5927\u9f20\u65e5\u9032  # Rate of progress for the large mouse\n\u5c0f\u9f20\u7387 = \u5c0f\u9f20\u65e5\u9032  # Rate of progress for the small mouse\n\n# \u7f6e\u6240\u51fa\u7387\uff0c\u76c8\u3001\u4e0d\u8db3\u5404\u5c45\u5176\u4e0b\n\u76c8\u5be6 = \u76c8 * 2  # Multiply excess by 2 days\n\u4e0d\u8db3\u5be6 = \u4e0d\u8db3 * 3  # Multiply deficiency by 3 days\n\n# \u5e76\u4ee5\u70ba\u5be6\n\u5be6 = \u76c8\u5be6 + \u4e0d\u8db3\u5be6  # Dividend\n\n# \u5e76\u76c8\u3001\u4e0d\u8db3\u70ba\u6cd5\n\u6cd5 = \u76c8 + \u4e0d\u8db3  # Divisor\n\n# \u5be6\u5982\u6cd5\u800c\u4e00\na = Fraction(\u5be6, \u6cd5)  # Days until they meet (36/17)\n\n# \u5404\u7a7f\u5e7e\u4f55\n\u5927\u9f20\u7a7f = \u5927\u9f20\u65e5\u9032 * a + \u5927\u9f20\u65e5\u9032 * (a - 1)  # Large mouse's total progress\n\u5c0f\u9f20\u7a7f = \u5c0f\u9f20\u65e5\u9032 * a + \u5c0f\u9f20\u65e5\u9032 * (a - 1)  # Small mouse's total progress\n\nb = \u5927\u9f20\u7a7f  # 59/17 chi\nc = \u5c0f\u9f20\u7a7f  # 26/17 chi", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2127, "completion_tokens": 3801, "total_tokens": 5928, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_60a3f2dc65"}}, "error": null}
