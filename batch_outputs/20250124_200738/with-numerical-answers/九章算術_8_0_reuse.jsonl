Solve for the remaining variable in the last row.\n4. Substitute back to solve for the other variables.\n\nAnswer: One bundle of upper grain yields *a*(=37/4) dou, one bundle of middle grain yields *b*(=17/4) dou, and one bundle of lower grain yields *c*(=11/4) dou.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Coefficients and totals from the problem\n# 3\u4e0a + 2\u4e2d + 1\u4e0b = 39\n# 2\u4e0a + 3\u4e2d + 1\u4e0b = 34\n# 1\u4e0a + 2\u4e2d + 3\u4e0b = 26\n\n# Step 1: Represent the equations\n\u4e0a\u79be1, \u4e0a\u79be2, \u4e0a\u79be3 = 3, 2, 1\n\u4e2d\u79be1, \u4e2d\u79be2, \u4e2d\u79be3 = 2, 3, 2\n\u4e0b\u79be1, \u4e0b\u79be2, \u4e0b\u79be3 = 1, 1, 3\n\u5be61, \u5be62, \u5be63 = 39, 34, 26\n\n# Step 2: Eliminate \u4e0a\u79be (upper grain)\n# Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3, then subtract\n\u4e2d\u79be_1 = 2 * \u4e2d\u79be1 - 3 * \u4e2d\u79be2\n\u4e0b\u79be_1 = 2 * \u4e0b\u79be1 - 3 * \u4e0b\u79be2\n\u5be6_1 = 2 * \u5be61 - 3 * \u5be62\n\n# Multiply the second equation by 1 and the third equation by 2, then subtract\n\u4e2d\u79be_2 = \u4e2d\u79be2 - 2 * \u4e2d\u79be3\n\u4e0b\u79be_2 = \u4e0b\u79be2 - 2 * \u4e0b\u79be3\n\u5be6_2 = \u5be62 - 2 * \u5be63\n\n# Step 3: Eliminate \u4e2d\u79be (middle grain)\n# Multiply the first reduced equation by \u4e0b\u79be_2 and the second reduced equation by \u4e0b\u79be_1, then subtract\n\u6cd5 = \u4e0b\u79be_1 * \u4e2d\u79be_2 - \u4e0b\u79be_2 * \u4e2d\u79be_1\n\u5be6 = \u4e0b\u79be_1 * \u5be6_2 - \u4e0b\u79be_2 * \u5be6_1\n\n# Solve for \u4e0b\u79be (lower grain)\n\u4e0b\u79be = Fraction(\u5be6, \u6cd5)\n\n# Step 4: Solve for \u4e2d\u79be (middle grain)\n\u5be6 = \u4e2d\u79be_1 * \u4e0b\u79be - \u5be6_1\n\u4e2d\u79be = Fraction(\u5be6, -\u4e0b\u79be_1)\n\n# Step 5: Solve for \u4e0a\u79be (upper grain)\n\u5be6 = \u4e0a\u79be1 * \u4e0b\u79be + \u4e2d\u79be1 * \u4e2d\u79be - \u5be61\n\u4e0a\u79be = Fraction(\u5be6, -\u4e0a\u79be1)\n\n# Final results\na = \u4e0a\u79be  # 37/4\nb = \u4e2d\u79be  # 17/4\nc = \u4e0b\u79be  # 11/4", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2241, "completion_tokens": 4748, "total_tokens": 6989, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_60a3f2dc65"}}, "error": null}
