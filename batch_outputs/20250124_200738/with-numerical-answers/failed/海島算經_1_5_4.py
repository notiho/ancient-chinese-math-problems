今有東南望波口，立兩表南、北相去九丈，以索薄地連之。當北表之西卻行去表六丈，薄地遙望波口南岸，入索北端四丈二寸。以望北岸，入前所望表里一丈二尺。又卻後行去表一十三丈五尺。薄地遙望波口南岸，與南表參合。問波口廣幾何？
術曰：以後去表乘入索，如表相去而一。所得，以前去表減之，餘以為法；復以前去表減後去表，餘以乘入所望表里為實，實如法而一，得波口廣。
答曰： a(=5/3)里 。

Suppose there is a point at the southeast looking toward the mouth of a river. Two poles are erected, one to the south and one to the north, separated by 9 zhang. A rope is stretched across the ground connecting them. 

From the north pole, move westward 6 zhang away from the pole. From this position, looking toward the south bank of the river mouth, the rope enters the north end by 4 zhang and 2 cun. Looking toward the north bank, the rope enters the previous pole's interior by 1 zhang and 2 chi. 

Then, move further westward, 13 zhang and 5 chi away from the pole. From this position, looking toward the south bank of the river mouth, the rope aligns with the south pole.

Question: What is the width of the river mouth?

The procedure says: Multiply the later distance from the pole by the rope's entry. If it is equal to the distance between the poles, divide by 1. Subtract the earlier distance from the pole from the result. The remainder is the divisor. Subtract the earlier distance from the later distance, and multiply the result by the rope's entry into the pole's interior. This becomes the dividend. Divide the dividend by the divisor to obtain the width of the river mouth.

Answer: *a*(=5/3) li.
