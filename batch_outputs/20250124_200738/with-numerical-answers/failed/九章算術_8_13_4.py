今有白禾二步、青禾三步、黃禾四步、黑禾五步，實各不滿斗。白取青、黃，青取黃、黑，黃取黑、白，黑取白、青，各一步，而實滿斗。問︰白、青、黃、黑禾實一步各幾何？
術曰：如方程，各置所取，以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：白禾一步實 a(=11/37)斗 ，青禾一步實 b(=28/111)斗 ，黃禾一步實 c(=17/111)斗 ，黑禾一步實 d(=10/111)斗 。

The problem involves solving a system of linear equations based on the given relationships between the different types of grains (white, green, yellow, and black). The solution uses the ancient Chinese method of solving simultaneous equations, which is described in the "方程術" (method of equations). Below is the Python implementation of the procedure:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the coefficients of the equations based on the problem statement:
# White grain (白禾), Green grain (青禾), Yellow grain (黃禾), Black grain (黑禾)
# Each equation represents the relationship of grains taken and the total sum.

# Coefficients matrix (秉數)
coefficients = [
    [1, -1, -1, 0],  # White takes Green and Yellow
    [0, 1, -1, -1],  # Green takes Yellow and Black
    [-1, 0, 1, -1],  # Yellow takes Black and White
    [-1, -1, 0, 1]   # Black takes White and Green
]

# Total sum of grains (實)
totals = [1, 1, 1, 1]  # Each step results in a full dou (斗)

# Step 1: Eliminate variables using the method described in the 方程術
# Normalize the first row
for i in range(1, 4):
    factor = Fraction(coefficients[i][0], coefficients[0][0])
    for j in range(4):
        coefficients[i][j] -= factor * coefficients[0][j]
    totals[i] -= factor * totals[0]

# Normalize the second row
for i in range(2, 4):
    factor = Fraction(coefficients[i][1], coefficients[1][1])
    for j in range(1, 4):
        coefficients[i][j] -= factor * coefficients[1][j]
    totals[i] -= factor * totals[1]

# Normalize the third row
factor = Fraction(coefficients[3][2], coefficients[2][2])
for j in range(2, 4):
    coefficients[3][j] -= factor * coefficients[2][j]
totals[3] -= factor * totals[2]

# Step 2: Back-substitute to solve for each variable
# Solve for Black grain (黑禾)
黑禾 = Fraction(totals[3], coefficients[3][3])

# Solve for Yellow grain (黃禾)
黃禾 = Fraction(totals[2] - coefficients[2][3] * 黑禾, coefficients[2][2])

# Solve for Green grain (青禾)
青禾 = Fraction(totals[1] - coefficients[1][2] * 黃禾 - coefficients[1][3] * 黑禾, coefficients[1][1])

# Solve for White grain (白禾)
白禾 = Fraction(totals[0] - coefficients[0][1] * 青禾 - coefficients[0][2] * 黃禾 - coefficients[0][3] * 黑禾, coefficients[0][0])

# Final results
a = 白禾  # White grain per step
b = 青禾  # Green grain per step
c = 黃禾  # Yellow grain per step
d = 黑禾  # Black grain per step

# Output the results
a, b, c, d

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Coefficients Matrix**: The relationships between the grains are encoded into a matrix where each row represents an equation.
2. **Totals**: The right-hand side of the equations, representing the total amount of grain (1 dou for each equation).
3. **Elimination**: The method described in the "方程術" is used to eliminate variables row by row, reducing the system to a triangular form.
4. **Back-Substitution**: Starting from the last variable, each variable is solved in reverse order using the reduced system.
5. **Results**: The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` represent the amount of grain (in dou) for each type of grain per step.

### Final Answer:
- White grain (白禾) per step: \( a = \frac{11}{37} \) dou
- Green grain (青禾) per step: \( b = \frac{28}{111} \) dou
- Yellow grain (黃禾) per step: \( c = \frac{17}{111} \) dou
- Black grain (黑禾) per step: \( d = \frac{10}{111} \) dou
