今有白禾二步、青禾三步、黃禾四步、黑禾五步，實各不滿斗。白取青、黃，青取黃、黑，黃取黑、白，黑取白、青，各一步，而實滿斗。問︰白、青、黃、黑禾實一步各幾何？
術曰：如方程，各置所取，以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：白禾一步實 a(=11/37)斗 ，青禾一步實 b(=28/111)斗 ，黃禾一步實 c(=17/111)斗 ，黑禾一步實 d(=10/111)斗 。

To solve this problem, we need to translate the ancient Chinese method of solving simultaneous linear equations into Python code. The problem involves four types of grain (white, green, yellow, and black), each contributing a certain fraction of a dou (a unit of volume). The relationships between the grains are described, and we need to determine how much each type contributes per step.

The ancient method described is essentially a system of linear equations solved using elimination. Here's the Python implementation:

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the coefficients of the equations based on the problem description
# Each row corresponds to an equation, and each column corresponds to a grain type
# The last column represents the total (1 dou)
coefficients = [
    [1, -1, -1, 0, -1],  # White takes from Green and Yellow
    [0, 1, -1, -1, -1],  # Green takes from Yellow and Black
    [-1, 0, 1, -1, -1],  # Yellow takes from Black and White
    [-1, -1, 0, 1, -1]   # Black takes from White and Green
]

# Initialize the variables for the grains
white, green, yellow, black = Fraction(0), Fraction(0), Fraction(0), Fraction(0)

# Solve the system of equations using elimination
# Step 1: Normalize the first equation
coefficients[0] = [Fraction(x, coefficients[0][0]) for x in coefficients[0]]

# Step 2: Eliminate the first variable from the other equations
for i in range(1, len(coefficients)):
    factor = coefficients[i][0]
    coefficients[i] = [coefficients[i][j] - factor * coefficients[0][j] for j in range(len(coefficients[0]))]

# Step 3: Normalize the second equation
coefficients[1] = [Fraction(x, coefficients[1][1]) for x in coefficients[1]]

# Step 4: Eliminate the second variable from the other equations
for i in [0, 2, 3]:
    factor = coefficients[i][1]
    coefficients[i] = [coefficients[i][j] - factor * coefficients[1][j] for j in range(len(coefficients[0]))]

# Step 5: Normalize the third equation
coefficients[2] = [Fraction(x, coefficients[2][2]) for x in coefficients[2]]

# Step 6: Eliminate the third variable from the other equations
for i in [0, 1, 3]:
    factor = coefficients[i][2]
    coefficients[i] = [coefficients[i][j] - factor * coefficients[2][j] for j in range(len(coefficients[0]))]

# Step 7: Normalize the fourth equation
coefficients[3] = [Fraction(x, coefficients[3][3]) for x in coefficients[3]]

# Step 8: Eliminate the fourth variable from the other equations
for i in [0, 1, 2]:
    factor = coefficients[i][3]
    coefficients[i] = [coefficients[i][j] - factor * coefficients[3][j] for j in range(len(coefficients[0]))]

# The solutions are now in the last column of the coefficients matrix
white = coefficients[0][-1]
green = coefficients[1][-1]
yellow = coefficients[2][-1]
black = coefficients[3][-1]

# Output the results
a = white  # 11/37 dou
b = green  # 28/111 dou
c = yellow # 17/111 dou
d = black  # 10/111 dou

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Matrix Representation**: The problem is represented as a system of linear equations in matrix form. Each row corresponds to an equation, and each column corresponds to a variable (white, green, yellow, black).
2. **Gaussian Elimination**: The system is solved using Gaussian elimination, which involves normalizing rows and eliminating variables step by step.
3. **Fraction Arithmetic**: The `Fraction` class is used to ensure exact arithmetic with rational numbers, as required by the problem.

### Final Answer:
- White grain per step: \( a = \frac{11}{37} \) dou
- Green grain per step: \( b = \frac{28}{111} \) dou
- Yellow grain per step: \( c = \frac{17}{111} \) dou
- Black grain per step: \( d = \frac{10}{111} \) dou
