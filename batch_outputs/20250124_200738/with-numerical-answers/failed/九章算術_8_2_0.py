今有上禾二秉，中禾三秉，下禾四秉，實皆不滿斗。上取中，中取下，下取上各一秉而實滿斗。問︰上、中、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，各置所取，以正負術入之。正負術曰：同名相除，異名相益，正無入負之，負無入正之。其異名相除，同名相益，正無入正之，負無入負之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a(=9/25)斗 ，中禾一秉實 b(=7/25)斗 ，下禾一秉實 c(=4/25)斗 。

Suppose there are 2 bundles of upper-grade grain, 3 bundles of middle-grade grain, and 4 bundles of lower-grade grain, all of which together do not fill a dou.
When one bundle of upper-grade grain is taken from the middle-grade grain, one bundle of middle-grade grain is taken from the lower-grade grain, and one bundle of lower-grade grain is taken from the upper-grade grain, the total fills exactly one dou.
Question: how much does one bundle of upper-grade, middle-grade, and lower-grade grain weigh respectively?

The procedure says: Treat this as a system of equations. Assign what is taken to each variable and solve using the positive-negative method.
The positive-negative method says: When the names are the same, subtract; when the names are different, add. If positive has no counterpart, subtract the negative; if negative has no counterpart, subtract the positive.
When the names are different, divide; when the names are the same, add. If positive has no counterpart, add the positive; if negative has no counterpart, add the negative.

The method for solving systems of equations says: Assign 3 bundles of upper-grade grain, 2 bundles of middle-grade grain, and 1 bundle of lower-grade grain, with a total of 39/25 dou, on the right-hand side. Arrange the middle and left-hand sides similarly. Multiply the upper-grade grain row by the middle-grade grain row and divide directly. Repeat for the next row. Then, multiply the middle-grade grain row by the lower-grade grain row and divide directly. For the left-hand side, if the lower-grade grain row is not fully reduced, assign the upper-grade grain as the divisor and the lower-grade grain as the dividend. The dividend is the value of the lower-grade grain. To find the middle-grade grain, multiply the divisor by the middle-grade grain row and divide by the lower-grade grain value. The remainder, divided by the number of middle-grade bundles plus one, gives the value of the middle-grade grain. To find the upper-grade grain, multiply the divisor by the upper-grade grain row and divide by the values of the lower-grade and middle-grade grain. The remainder, divided by the number of upper-grade bundles plus one, gives the value of the upper-grade grain. The values are all as per the method, and each is less than one dou.

Answer: One bundle of upper-grade grain weighs *a*(=9/25) dou, one bundle of middle-grade grain weighs *b*(=7/25) dou, and one bundle of lower-grade grain weighs *c*(=4/25) dou.
