This problem is complex and involves advanced ancient Chinese mathematical techniques for solving cubic equations. Below is the translation of the problem and the corresponding Python code to solve it step by step.

### Problem:
Suppose there are 5140 shi of millet. It is desired to construct one square pit and one round pit, both with a small opening at the top and a larger base at the bottom. The side length of the square opening is equal to the diameter of the circular opening, and the depths of the two pits are the same. The depth is 7 chi less than the bottom side length of the square pit and 1 zhang 4 chi more than the top side length of the square pit. Both pits are filled completely with millet, and the millet is just enough to fill both.

Question: What are the side lengths of the square opening, the diameter of the circular opening, and the depth of the pits?

---

### Procedure:
1. Multiply 42 by the volume conversion factor (斛法), then multiply by the amount of millet. Divide by 75 to obtain the total volume of the pits.
2. Let the difference between the top and bottom dimensions of the square pit be the variable. Square this difference, divide by 3, and multiply by the depth difference to calculate the "corner excess" (隅陽冪).
3. Subtract the corner excess from the total volume to get the "solid volume" (實).
4. Multiply the depth difference by the difference between the top and bottom dimensions, and add the corner excess to get the "method for the square pit" (方法).
5. Add the difference between the top and bottom dimensions to the depth difference to get the "method for the circular pit" (廉法).
6. Solve the cubic equation to find the top dimension of the square pit. Add the difference to get the bottom dimension and the depth.

### Explanation of Results:
- `a = 7 尺` (Top side length of the square pit or diameter of the circular pit)
- `b = 14/5 丈` (Bottom side length of the square pit)
- `c = 21/10 丈` (Depth of the pits)

This code follows the ancient Chinese mathematical procedure step by step, using fractions to ensure precision.
