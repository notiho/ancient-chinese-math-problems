今有武馬一匹，中馬二匹，下馬三匹，皆載四十石至阪，皆不能上。武馬借中馬一匹，中馬借下馬一匹，下馬借武馬一匹，乃皆上。問︰武、中、下馬一匹各力引幾何？
術曰：如方程各置所借，以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：武馬一匹力引 a(=160/7)石 ，中馬一匹力引 b(=120/7)石 ，下馬一匹力引 c(=40/7)石 。

Suppose there is one Wu horse, two Zhong horses, and three Xia horses. Each is tasked with carrying 40 shi up a slope, but none can make it up alone.
The Wu horse borrows one Zhong horse, the Zhong horse borrows one Xia horse, and the Xia horse borrows one Wu horse. With this arrangement, they are all able to ascend.
Question: how much pulling power does one Wu horse, one Zhong horse, and one Xia horse have respectively?

The procedure says: Treat this as a system of equations, placing the borrowed amounts into the equations using positive and negative values.

The procedure for solving systems of equations says:
1. Place the coefficients for the Wu, Zhong, and Xia horses as 3, 2, and 1 respectively, with the total load as 39 dou on the right side.
2. Arrange the equations for the middle and left sides similarly to the right side.
3. Multiply the top row (Wu horse) by the middle row (Zhong horse) and divide directly.
4. Repeat this for the next row, also dividing directly.
5. For the middle row, multiply the remaining coefficients of the Zhong horse by the left row (Xia horse) and divide directly.
6. For the left side (Xia horse), if there are remaining coefficients, treat the top as the divisor and the bottom as the dividend. The result is the pulling power of the Xia horse.
7. To find the Zhong horse's pulling power, multiply the divisor by the middle row's Xia horse result and divide by the Xia horse's pulling power.
8. For the Wu horse, multiply the divisor by the top row's Xia horse result and divide by the combined pulling powers of the Xia and Zhong horses.
9. The results are the pulling powers of each horse, expressed in dou.

Answer: The Wu horse has a pulling power of *a*(=160/7) shi, the Zhong horse has a pulling power of *b*(=120/7) shi, and the Xia horse has a pulling power of *c*(=40/7) shi.
