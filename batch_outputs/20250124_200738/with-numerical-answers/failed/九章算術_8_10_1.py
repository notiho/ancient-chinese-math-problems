今有二馬、一牛價過一萬，如半馬之價。一馬、二牛價不滿一萬，如半牛之價。問︰牛、馬價各幾何？
術曰：如方程，損益之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：馬價 a(=60000/11)錢 ，牛價 b(=20000/11)錢 。

Suppose the price of two horses and one ox exceeds 10,000 qian by the price of half a horse.
The price of one horse and two oxen is less than 10,000 qian by the price of half an ox.
Question: what are the prices of a horse and an ox respectively?

The procedure says: Solve this using the method of simultaneous equations and the method of balancing gains and losses.

The method of simultaneous equations says:
1. Place the coefficients of the variables (the "禾") in rows: the top row for horses, the middle row for oxen, and the bottom row for constants.
2. Write the total value (the "實") on the right side.
3. Perform elimination by multiplying and dividing rows to simplify the system.
4. Solve for the variables step by step, starting from the bottom row and working upwards.

Answer: The price of a horse is *a*(=60000/11) qian, and the price of an ox is *b*(=20000/11) qian.

# Equations:
# 2馬 + 1牛 = 10000 + 1/2馬
# 1馬 + 2牛 = 10000 - 1/2牛

# Rewrite the equations in standard form:
# (1) 4馬 + 2牛 = 20000
# (2) 2馬 + 4牛 = 20000

# Coefficients for the system of equations:
# 上禾 (馬 coefficients): [4, 2]
# 中禾 (牛 coefficients): [2, 4]
# 下禾 (constants): [20000, 20000]

# Perform elimination:
# Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 4 to align coefficients:
上禾 = [4, 2]
中禾 = [2, 4]
下禾 = [20000, 20000]

# Eliminate one variable (牛):
# Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1:
上禾[0] *= 2
中禾[0] *= 2
下禾[0] *= 2

上禾[1] *= 1
中禾[1] *= 1
下禾[1] *= 1

# Subtract the second equation from the first:
上禾_elim = 上禾[0] - 上禾[1]
中禾_elim = 中禾[0] - 中禾[1]
下禾_elim = 下禾[0] - 下禾[1]

# Solve for 馬 (horse price):
馬價 = Fraction(下禾_elim, 上禾_elim)  # 60000/11

# Substitute 馬價 back into one of the original equations to solve for 牛 (ox price):
牛價 = Fraction(20000 - 2 * 馬價, 4)  # 20000/11

a = 馬價  # 60000/11
