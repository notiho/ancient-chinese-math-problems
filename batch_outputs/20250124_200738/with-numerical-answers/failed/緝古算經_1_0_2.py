假今天正十一月朔夜半，日在鬥十度七百分度之四百八十。以章歲為母，朔月行定分九千，朔日定小余一萬，日法二萬，章歲七百，亦名行分法。今不取加時日度。問：天正朔夜半之時月在何處？
術曰：以章歲減朔月行定分，余以乘朔日定小余，滿日法而一，為先行分。不盡者，半法已上收成一，已下者棄之。若先行分滿日行分而一，為度分，以減朔日夜半日所在度分，若度分不足減，加往宿度；其分不足減者，退一度為行分而減之，余即朔日夜半月行所在度及分也。
答曰：在鬥 a(=333/70)度 。

Suppose it is the first day of the eleventh month at midnight, and the sun is at 10 degrees and 480/700 of a degree in the constellation Dou.
Using the zhang-sui (章歲) as the base, the fixed movement of the new moon is 9000, the fixed minor remainder of the new moon is 10000, the solar divisor is 20000, and the zhang-sui is 700, also called the movement divisor.
Now, we do not account for the additional time or solar degrees.
Question: At midnight on the first day of the month, where is the moon located?

The procedure says:
1. Subtract the fixed movement of the new moon from the zhang-sui. Multiply the remainder by the fixed minor remainder of the new moon.
2. Divide the result by the solar divisor. The quotient is the initial movement. If there is a remainder, round up if it is greater than or equal to half the divisor; otherwise, discard it.
3. If the initial movement exceeds the solar movement divisor, divide it by the solar movement divisor to obtain degrees and fractions of degrees.
4. Subtract the degrees and fractions from the sun's position at midnight on the first day. If the degrees are insufficient to subtract, add the degrees of the previous constellation.
5. If the fractions are insufficient to subtract, subtract one degree and convert it into fractions to complete the subtraction.
6. The remainder is the moon's position at midnight on the first day of the month.

Answer: The moon is at *a*(=333/70) degrees in the constellation Dou.
