今有出錢七百二十，買縑一匹二丈一尺。欲丈率之，問︰丈幾何？
經術術曰：以所求率乘錢數為實，以所買率為法，實如法得一。

Suppose there is an expenditure of 720 qian to buy one bolt of silk, which is 2 zhang and 1 chi in length.
It is desired to calculate the cost per zhang.
Question: how much qian per zhang?

The procedure says: Multiply the desired rate (1 zhang) by the total expenditure (qian), obtaining the dividend.
Take the rate of what was bought (2 zhang and 1 chi) as the divisor.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to obtain the cost per zhang.

Answer: 1 zhang costs *a*(=7200/61) qian.
