今有客馬日行三百里。客去忘持衣，日已三分之一，主人乃覺。持衣追及與之而還，至家視日四分之三。問︰主人馬不休，日行幾何？
術曰：置四分日之三，除三分日之一，半其餘以為法。副置法，增三分日之一，以三百里乘之，為實。實如法，得主人馬一日行。
荅曰： a(=780)里 。

Suppose there is a guest's horse that travels 300 li in a day. 
The guest left but forgot to bring their clothes. After 1/3 of the day had passed, the host realized this.
The host chased after the guest, caught up with them, gave them the clothes, and returned home. 
By the time the host returned home, 3/4 of the day had passed.
Question: how far does the host's horse travel in one day without resting?

The procedure says: Place 3/4 of the day and divide it by 1/3 of the day. Halve the remainder to obtain the divisor.
Place the divisor again, add 1/3 of the day to it, and multiply it by 300 li to obtain the dividend.
Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the distance the host's horse travels in one day.

Answer: *a*(=780) li.
