今有出錢六百一十，買羽二千一百翭。欲其貴賤率之，問︰各幾何？
反其率術曰：以錢數為法，所率為實，實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法少，實多。二物各以所得多少之數乘法實，即物數。
荅曰：其 a(=1140)翭 ， b(=3)翭 一錢 其 c(=960)翭 ， d(=4)翭 一錢

Suppose there is an expenditure of 610 qian to buy 2100 feathers. It is desired to determine the rates of their relative value (expensive and cheap).
Question: what are the rates for each?

The procedure for reversing the rates says: Take the amount of money as the divisor, and the quantity of the items as the dividend. Divide the dividend by the divisor to obtain the rate. 
If the dividend does not fully divide the divisor, subtract the dividend from the divisor, making the divisor smaller and the dividend larger. 
For the two items, multiply the obtained rate by the divisor and dividend to determine the quantity of each.

Answer: The expensive feathers are *a*(=1140) feathers, at a rate of *b*(=3) feathers per qian. The cheap feathers are *c*(=960) feathers, at a rate of *d*(=4) feathers per qian.
