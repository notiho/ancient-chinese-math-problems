This problem involves calculating the diameter of a circle given its area in ancient Chinese mathematics. The procedure is complex and involves iterative calculations. Below is the Python implementation of the procedure described:

#----- content starts here -----

"""
Suppose there is an area of 35,000 bu.
Question: what is the diameter of the circle?

The procedure says:
Place the area of 35,000 bu and multiply it by 12, obtaining 420,000 as the dividend.
Next, borrow one counting rod to form the initial divisor, and shift one place to the left until reaching the hundreds place.
Place the initial quotient of 600 above the dividend and place 60,000 below the dividend.
The divisor above is called the "method divisor."
Use the initial quotient of 600 to divide the dividend, completing the division.
Double the "method divisor," shift it one place to the left, and shift the divisor two places to the left.
Place the next quotient of 40 after the previous quotient, and place 400 below the "method divisor."
The divisor above is now called the "edge divisor."
Use the next quotient of 40 to divide the dividend, completing the division.
Double the "edge divisor," follow the "method divisor," shift it one place to the left, and shift the divisor two places to the left.
Place the next quotient of 8 after the previous quotient, and place 8 below the "method divisor."
The divisor above is now called the "corner divisor."
Use the next quotient of 8 to divide the dividend, completing the division.
Double the "corner divisor," follow the "method divisor," and the final quotient is 648.
The final divisor is 1,296, with a remainder of 96.
This gives the diameter as 648 bu and 96/1,296 bu.

Answer: *a*(=17498/27) bu.

### Explanation:
1. The procedure involves iterative division and refinement of the divisor (`方法`) and the quotient (`上商`).
2. The initial divisor is set based on the area, and the quotient is refined step by step.
3. The final result is expressed as a mixed number, combining the integer part of the quotient and the fractional remainder.

The answer is `a = 17498/27` bu.
