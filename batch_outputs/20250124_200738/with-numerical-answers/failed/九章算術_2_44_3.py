今有出錢六百一十，買羽二千一百翭。欲其貴賤率之，問︰各幾何？
反其率術曰：以錢數為法，所率為實，實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法少，實多。二物各以所得多少之數乘法實，即物數。
荅曰：其 a(=1140)翭 ， b(=3)翭 一錢 其 c(=960)翭 ， d(=4)翭 一錢

Suppose there is an expenditure of 610 qian to buy 2100 feathers.
It is desired to determine the rate of their relative value (expensive and cheap).
Question: what are the quantities and rates for each?

The procedure for reversing the rate says: Take the amount of money as the divisor, and the quantity to be rated as the dividend.
Divide the dividend by the divisor, obtaining the rate.
For those not reaching the divisor, subtract the divisor from the dividend, making the divisor smaller and the dividend larger.
For the two items, multiply the obtained rate by the respective divisor and dividend to determine the quantities.

Answer: The expensive feathers are *a*(=1140) feathers, at a rate of *b*(=3) feathers per qian.
The cheap feathers are *c*(=960) feathers, at a rate of *d*(=4) feathers per qian.
