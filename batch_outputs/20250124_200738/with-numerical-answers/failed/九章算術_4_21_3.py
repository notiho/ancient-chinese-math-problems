又有積一百九十三萬七千五百四十一尺、二十七分尺之一十七。問︰為立方幾何？
開立方術曰：置積為實。借一算步之，超二等。議所得，以再乘所借一算為法，而除之。除已，三之為定法。復除，折而下。以三乘所得數置中行。復借一算置下行。步之，中超一，下超二等。復置議，以一乘中，再乘下，皆副以加定法。以定法除。除已，倍下、并中從定法。復除，折下如前。開之不盡者，亦為不可開。若積有分者，通分內子為定實。定實乃開之，訖，開其母以報除。若母不可開者，又以母再乘定實，乃開之。訖，令如母而一。
荅曰： a(=374/3)尺 。

This problem involves finding the cube root of a given number, expressed as a mixed fraction. The procedure for extracting cube roots in ancient Chinese mathematics is quite detailed and involves iterative steps. Below is the Python implementation of the procedure, following the steps described in the problem.

# Step 1: Place the volume as the dividend (實). If there are fractions, convert them to a common denominator.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Conversion**: The given volume is converted into a `Fraction` to handle both the integer and fractional parts.
2. **Iterative Process**: The cube root is extracted iteratively by guessing digits, calculating cubes, and refining the guess.
3. **Precision Handling**: If the cube root cannot be determined exactly, the process continues with finer precision by multiplying the remainder.
4. **Output**: The final cube root is stored in `a`, which is `374/3` chi.

This implementation follows the ancient procedure step by step, ensuring accuracy and adherence to the described method.
