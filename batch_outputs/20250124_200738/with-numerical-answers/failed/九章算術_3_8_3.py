今有甲持粟三升，乙持糲米三升，丙持糲飯三升。欲令合而分之，問︰各幾何？
返衰術曰：列置衰而令相乘，動者為不動者衰。術曰：以粟率五十、糲米率三十、糲飯率七十五為衰、而返衰之，副并為法。以九升乘未并者各自為實。實如法得一升。
荅曰：甲 a(=27/10)升 。乙 b(=9/2)升 。丙 c(=9/5)升 。

Suppose person A holds 3 sheng of millet, person B holds 3 sheng of roughly husked millet, and person C holds 3 sheng of roughly cooked millet.
It is desired to combine them and redistribute equally.
Question: how much does each person receive?

The reverse-weighting procedure says: Arrange the weights and let them multiply with each other. The moving one becomes the weight of the unmoving one.
The procedure says: Take the millet rate as 50, the roughly husked millet rate as 30, and the roughly cooked millet rate as 75 as weights, and reverse-weight them.
Add the auxiliary values to form the divisor.
Multiply the total 9 sheng by the unadded values, each becoming its own dividend.
Divide the dividends by the divisor to obtain the amount of 1 sheng for each person.

The answer says: A receives *a*(=27/10) sheng, B receives *b*(=9/2) sheng, and C receives *c*(=9/5) sheng.
