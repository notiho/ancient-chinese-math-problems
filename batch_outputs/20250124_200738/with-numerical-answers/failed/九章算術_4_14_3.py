Suppose there is an area of 564752 and 1/4 bu². 
Question: what is the side length of the square field?

The procedure for square root extraction says: Place the area as the dividend. Borrow one counting rod and place it, skipping one position. Estimate the result. Multiply the borrowed counting rod by 1 to form the divisor, and divide. After division, double the divisor to form the fixed divisor. Divide again. Reduce the divisor and bring it down. Place the borrowed counting rod as before, and estimate again. Multiply the result by 1, add it to the fixed divisor, and divide. Subtract the result from the fixed divisor. Continue dividing and reducing as before. If the square root cannot be fully extracted, it is considered non-extractable, and the side length should be expressed as a fraction. If the area has a fractional part, convert it to a common fraction and include it in the calculation. Extract the square root of the numerator and denominator separately. If the denominator cannot be square-rooted, multiply the denominator by the numerator and extract the square root, ensuring the result is expressed as a fraction.

Answer: *a*(=1503/2) bu.
