今有積一千九百五十三尺、八分尺之一。問︰為立方幾何？
開立方術曰：置積為實。借一算步之，超二等。議所得，以再乘所借一算為法，而除之。除已，三之為定法。復除，折而下。以三乘所得數置中行。復借一算置下行。步之，中超一，下超二等。復置議，以一乘中，再乘下，皆副以加定法。以定法除。除已，倍下、并中從定法。復除，折下如前。開之不盡者，亦為不可開。若積有分者，通分內子為定實。定實乃開之，訖，開其母以報除。若母不可開者，又以母再乘定實，乃開之。訖，令如母而一。
荅曰： a(=25/2)尺 。

Suppose there is a volume of 1953 and 1/8 cubic chi.
Question: what is the cube root of this volume?

The procedure for extracting cube roots says:
Place the volume as the dividend. Borrow one counting rod, and step it, skipping two places. 
Evaluate the result, and multiply the borrowed rod by itself to form the divisor, and divide by it.
After dividing, multiply the result by 3 to form the fixed divisor. Divide again, and reduce the remainder downward.
Multiply the result by 3 and place it in the middle row. Borrow one rod again and place it in the bottom row.
Step it, skipping one place in the middle and two places in the bottom. Evaluate again, multiply the middle by 1 and the bottom by 2, and add these to the fixed divisor.
Divide by the fixed divisor. After dividing, double the bottom and add it to the middle to form the new fixed divisor. Divide again, reducing the remainder as before.
If the root cannot be fully extracted, it is considered unsolvable. If the volume has a fraction, convert the fraction to a common denominator and treat it as the dividend.
Extract the root of the numerator, and then extract the root of the denominator to report the result. If the denominator cannot be rooted, multiply the denominator by itself and the numerator, then extract the root. Finally, adjust the result to match the denominator.

Answer: *a*(=25/2) chi.
