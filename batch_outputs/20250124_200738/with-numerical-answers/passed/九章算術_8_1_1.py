今有上禾七秉，損實一斗，益之下禾二秉，而實一十斗。下禾八秉，益實一斗與上禾二秉，而實一十斗。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程。損之曰益，益之曰損。損實一斗者，其實過一十斗也。益實一斗者，其實不滿一十斗也。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a(=35/26)斗 ，下禾一秉實 b(=41/52)斗 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations based on the relationships between the quantities of upper and lower grains (上禾 and 下禾) and their respective yields. The solution follows the ancient Chinese method of solving simultaneous equations, which is similar to Gaussian elimination.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Conditions:**
   - 7 bundles of upper grain (上禾) lose 1 dou of yield, and when 2 bundles of lower grain (下禾) are added, the total yield becomes 10 dou.
   - 8 bundles of lower grain (下禾) gain 1 dou of yield, and when 2 bundles of upper grain (上禾) are added, the total yield becomes 10 dou.

2. **Objective:**
   - Find the yield per bundle of upper grain (上禾) and lower grain (下禾).

3. **Procedure:**
   - Translate the problem into a system of equations:
     - \( 7x - 1 + 2y = 10 \) (Equation 1)
     - \( 8y + 1 + 2x = 10 \) (Equation 2)
   - Simplify the equations:
     - \( 7x + 2y = 11 \) (Simplified Equation 1)
     - \( 2x + 8y = 9 \) (Simplified Equation 2)
   - Solve the system of equations using elimination or substitution.

# Coefficients of the equations
# Equation 1: 7x + 2y = 11
# Equation 2: 2x + 8y = 9

# Define the coefficients
a1, b1, c1 = 7, 2, 11  # Coefficients of Equation 1
a2, b2, c2 = 2, 8, 9   # Coefficients of Equation 2

# Eliminate x by multiplying the equations to align coefficients of x
# Multiply Equation 1 by 2 and Equation 2 by 7
mult1, mult2 = 2, 7
a1, b1, c1 = a1 * mult1, b1 * mult1, c1 * mult1
a2, b2, c2 = a2 * mult2, b2 * mult2, c2 * mult2

# Subtract the equations to eliminate x
# (14x + 4y = 22) - (14x + 56y = 63)
b = b1 - b2  # Coefficient of y
c = c1 - c2  # Constant term

# Solve for y
y = Fraction(c, b)  # y = (22 - 63) / (4 - 56)

# Substitute y back into one of the original equations to solve for x
# Using Equation 1: 7x + 2y = 11
x = Fraction(c1 - b1 * y, a1)

# Results
a = x  # Yield per bundle of upper grain (上禾)
b = y  # Yield per bundle of lower grain (下禾)

# Output the results
a, b  # a = 35/26, b = 41/52

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Equations Setup:**
   - The two equations are derived from the problem statement and simplified.

2. **Elimination Method:**
   - The equations are multiplied to align the coefficients of \(x\), allowing elimination of \(x\) when the equations are subtracted.

3. **Solve for \(y\):**
   - After eliminating \(x\), the resulting equation is solved for \(y\).

4. **Substitute \(y\) Back:**
   - The value of \(y\) is substituted into one of the original equations to solve for \(x\).

5. **Results:**
   - The yield per bundle of upper grain (\(x\)) and lower grain (\(y\)) are expressed as fractions.

---

### Final Answer:
- Yield per bundle of upper grain (上禾): \( a = \frac{35}{26} \) dou.
- Yield per bundle of lower grain (下禾): \( b = \frac{41}{52} \) dou.
