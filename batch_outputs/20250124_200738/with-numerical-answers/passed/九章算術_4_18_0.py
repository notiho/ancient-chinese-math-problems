今有積一百八十六萬八百六十七尺。問︰為立方幾何？
開立方術曰：置積為實。借一算步之，超二等。議所得，以再乘所借一算為法，而除之。除已，三之為定法。復除，折而下。以三乘所得數置中行。復借一算置下行。步之，中超一，下超二等。復置議，以一乘中，再乘下，皆副以加定法。以定法除。除已，倍下、并中從定法。復除，折下如前。開之不盡者，亦為不可開。若積有分者，通分內子為定實。定實乃開之，訖，開其母以報除。若母不可開者，又以母再乘定實，乃開之。訖，令如母而一。
荅曰： a(=123)尺 。

Suppose there is a volume of 1,860,867 cubic chi.
Question: what is its cube root in chi?

The procedure for extracting the cube root says:
1. Place the volume as the dividend (實). Borrow one counting rod (算) and mark it, skipping two places (超二等).
2. Estimate the number (議所得). Multiply it by itself twice to form the divisor (法), and divide.
3. After dividing, multiply the result by 3 to form the fixed divisor (定法). Divide again, and reduce the remainder as before.
4. Multiply the result by 3 and place it in the middle row (中行). Borrow one counting rod and place it in the lower row (下行). Mark it, skipping one place in the middle and two places in the lower row.
5. Estimate again. Multiply the middle row by 1 and the lower row by 2, adding them to the fixed divisor. Divide by the fixed divisor.
6. After dividing, double the lower row and add it to the middle row to form the new fixed divisor. Divide again, and reduce the remainder as before.
7. If the volume cannot be fully divided, it is considered not extractable. If the volume has fractions, convert them to a common denominator and extract the cube root of the numerator and denominator separately. If the denominator cannot be extracted, multiply it by itself twice and extract the cube root of the product.

Answer: *a*(=123) chi.
