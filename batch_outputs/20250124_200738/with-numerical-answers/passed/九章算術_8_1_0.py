今有上禾七秉，損實一斗，益之下禾二秉，而實一十斗。下禾八秉，益實一斗與上禾二秉，而實一十斗。問︰上、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程。損之曰益，益之曰損。損實一斗者，其實過一十斗也。益實一斗者，其實不滿一十斗也。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a(=35/26)斗 ，下禾一秉實 b(=41/52)斗 。

This problem involves solving a system of linear equations to determine the yield of one sheaf of upper millet (*上禾*) and one sheaf of lower millet (*下禾*). The procedure describes how to approach the problem systematically using ancient Chinese methods, which resemble solving simultaneous equations.

### Problem Breakdown:
- **Given:**
  - 7 sheaves of upper millet lose 1 dou of yield, and adding 2 sheaves of lower millet results in a total yield of 10 dou.
  - 8 sheaves of lower millet gain 1 dou of yield, and adding 2 sheaves of upper millet results in a total yield of 10 dou.

- **Question:**
  - What is the yield of one sheaf of upper millet (*上禾*) and one sheaf of lower millet (*下禾*)?

- **Procedure:**
  - Translate the problem into equations and solve using the described method.

### Step-by-Step Solution in Python:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Translate the problem into equations:
# Let x = yield of one sheaf of upper millet (上禾)
# Let y = yield of one sheaf of lower millet (下禾)

# Equation 1: 7x - 1 + 2y = 10
# Simplify: 7x + 2y = 11

# Equation 2: 8y + 1 + 2x = 10
# Simplify: 2x + 8y = 9

# Coefficients of the equations:
# Equation 1: 7x + 2y = 11
a1, b1, c1 = 7, 2, 11

# Equation 2: 2x + 8y = 9
a2, b2, c2 = 2, 8, 9

# Solve using the elimination method:
# Multiply Equation 1 by b2 (8) and Equation 2 by b1 (2) to align the coefficients of y:
eq1_mult = b2  # 8
eq2_mult = b1  # 2

# Multiply through:
A1 = a1 * eq1_mult  # 7 * 8 = 56
B1 = b1 * eq1_mult  # 2 * 8 = 16
C1 = c1 * eq1_mult  # 11 * 8 = 88

A2 = a2 * eq2_mult  # 2 * 2 = 4
B2 = b2 * eq2_mult  # 8 * 2 = 16
C2 = c2 * eq2_mult  # 9 * 2 = 18

# Subtract the two equations to eliminate y:
# (A1 - A2)x + (B1 - B2)y = (C1 - C2)
A = A1 - A2  # 56 - 4 = 52
B = B1 - B2  # 16 - 16 = 0
C = C1 - C2  # 88 - 18 = 70

# Solve for x:
x = Fraction(C, A)  # x = 70 / 52 = 35 / 26

# Substitute x back into one of the original equations to solve for y:
# Use Equation 1: 7x + 2y = 11
# 2y = 11 - 7x
# y = (11 - 7x) / 2
y = Fraction(11 - 7 * x, 2)  # y = (11 - 7 * (35 / 26)) / 2 = 41 / 52

# Results:
a = x  # Yield of one sheaf of upper millet
b = y  # Yield of one sheaf of lower millet

# Output:
a, b  # a = 35/26, b = 41/52

### Explanation of the Results:
- The yield of one sheaf of upper millet (*上禾*) is **35/26 dou**.
- The yield of one sheaf of lower millet (*下禾*) is **41/52 dou**.

This solution follows the ancient Chinese method of systematically eliminating variables and solving equations step by step.
