荅曰： a(=319/8)尺 。

Suppose there is a volume of 63401 chi and 447/512 fractional chi.
Question: what is the cube root of this volume?

The procedure for extracting the cube root says: Place the volume as the dividend. Borrow one counting rod and mark it, skipping two places. Estimate the result, and multiply it twice by the borrowed counting rod to form the divisor, then divide. After dividing, multiply by 3 to form the fixed divisor. Divide again, reducing and lowering as necessary. Multiply the result by 3 and place it in the middle row. Borrow another counting rod and place it in the lower row. Mark it, skipping one place in the middle and two places in the lower row. Re-estimate, multiply the middle row by 1, and multiply the lower row by 2, adding all to the fixed divisor. Divide by the fixed divisor. After dividing, double the lower row and add it to the middle row to form the fixed divisor. Divide again, reducing as before. If the root cannot be fully extracted, it is considered non-extractable. If the volume has fractions, convert the fractions into a common denominator and treat it as the dividend. Extract the cube root of the numerator, and then extract the cube root of the denominator to adjust the result. If the denominator cannot be extracted, multiply the denominator twice by the adjusted numerator and extract the cube root. Finally, adjust the result to match the denominator.

Answer: *a*(=319/8) chi.

# 開立方術
# Step 1: Convert the volume into a single fraction (already done above).

# Step 2: Estimate the cube root.
# We know the cube root of 63401 is approximately 39.875 (from manual approximation).

# Step 3: Perform the cube root extraction using fractions.
# Start with an initial estimate for the cube root.
