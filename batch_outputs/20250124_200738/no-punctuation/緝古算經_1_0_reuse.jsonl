Subtract the monthly motion constant (\u6714\u6708\u884c\u5b9a\u5206) from the cycle constant (\u7ae0\u5d57).\n2. Multiply the remainder by the daily motion constant (\u6714\u65e5\u5b9a\u5c0f\u4f59).\n3. Divide the result by the full day divisor (\u65e5\u6cd5), obtaining the quotient (\u5148\u884c\u5206) and the remainder.\n4. If the remainder is greater than or equal to half the divisor, round up the quotient; otherwise, discard the remainder.\n5. Convert the quotient into degrees and fractions of a degree.\n6. Subtract this value from the sun's position at midnight to find the moon's position.\n7. If the subtraction results in a negative value, adjust by borrowing from the next degree.\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Constants\n\u7ae0\u5d57 = 700  # Cycle constant\n\u6714\u6708\u884c\u5b9a\u5206 = 9000  # Monthly motion constant\n\u6714\u65e5\u5b9a\u5c0f\u4f59 = 10000  # Daily motion constant\n\u65e5\u6cd5 = 20000  # Full day divisor\n\u65e5\u6240\u5728\u5ea6\u5206 = Fraction(10) + Fraction(481, 700)  # Sun's position at midnight\n\n# Step 1: Subtract the monthly motion constant from the cycle constant\n\u4f59 = \u7ae0\u5d57 - \u6714\u6708\u884c\u5b9a\u5206\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the remainder by the daily motion constant\n\u5be6 = \u4f59 * \u6714\u65e5\u5b9a\u5c0f\u4f59\n\n# Step 3: Divide the result by the full day divisor\n\u5148\u884c\u5206 = \u5be6 // \u65e5\u6cd5  # Quotient\n\u9918\u6578 = \u5be6 % \u65e5\u6cd5  # Remainder\n\n# Step 4: Round the quotient based on the remainder\nif \u9918\u6578 >= \u65e5\u6cd5 / 2:\n    \u5148\u884c\u5206 += 1\n\n# Step 5: Convert the quotient into degrees and fractions of a degree\n\u5ea6\u5206 = Fraction(\u5148\u884c\u5206, 10000)  # Convert to degrees\n\n# Step 6: Subtract this value from the sun's position at midnight\n\u6708\u6240\u5728\u5ea6\u5206 = \u65e5\u6240\u5728\u5ea6\u5206 - \u5ea6\u5206\n\n# Step 7: Adjust if the result is negative\nif \u6708\u6240\u5728\u5ea6\u5206 < 0:\n    \u6708\u6240\u5728\u5ea6\u5206 += 360  # Add 360 degrees to normalize\n\n# Final Answer\na = \u6708\u6240\u5728\u5ea6\u5206\n```\n\n### Explanation of Variables:\n- `\u7ae0\u5d57` (Cycle constant): Represents the cycle of the year.\n- `\u6714\u6708\u884c\u5b9a\u5206` (Monthly motion constant): Governs the moon's motion over a month.\n- `\u6714\u65e5\u5b9a\u5c0f\u4f59` (Daily motion constant): Governs the moon's motion over a day.\n- `\u65e5\u6cd5` (Full day divisor): Used to normalize the calculations.\n- `\u65e5\u6240\u5728\u5ea6\u5206` (Sun's position): The sun's position at midnight on the first day of the eleventh month.\n- `\u5148\u884c\u5206` (Initial motion): The moon's motion calculated in fractions of a degree.\n- `\u5ea6\u5206` (Degrees and fractions): The moon's motion converted to degrees.\n- `\u6708\u6240\u5728\u5ea6\u5206` (Moon's position): The final position of the moon at midnight.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe moon is located at **a** degrees in the Dipper (\u6597).", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1926, "completion_tokens": 4558, "total_tokens": 6484, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ec7eab8ec3"}}, "error": null}
