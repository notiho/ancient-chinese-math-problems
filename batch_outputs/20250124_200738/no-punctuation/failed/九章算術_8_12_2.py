This problem involves solving a system of equations using ancient Chinese "fangcheng" (方程) methods, which is an early form of linear algebra. The problem describes a situation where five families share a well, and each family's rope length is insufficient by a certain amount. The goal is to determine the depth of the well and the length of each family's rope.

Let's translate this into Python step by step, following the ancient procedure.

### Problem Setup:
- Let the depth of the well be `井深 = a` (in zhang).
- Let the rope lengths for families A, B, C, D, and E be `甲綆長 = b`, `乙綆長 = c`, `丙綆長 = d`, `丁綆長 = e`, and `戊綆長 = f` (in zhang or chi as appropriate).
- The relationships between the ropes and the well depth are given as:
  1. `a - b = 2`
  2. `b - c = 1`
  3. `c - d = 1`
  4. `d - e = 1`
  5. `e - f = 1`
  6. `f - a = 6`

### Procedure:
The ancient method involves solving this system of equations using elimination and substitution. Let's implement this step by step.

from fractions import Fraction

# Step 1: Represent the system of equations
# Let a = 井深 (well depth), b = 甲綆長, c = 乙綆長, d = 丙綆長, e = 丁綆長, f = 戊綆長
# The equations are:
# 1. a - b = 2
# 2. b - c = 1
# 3. c - d = 1
# 4. d - e = 1
# 5. e - f = 1
# 6. f - a = 6

# Step 2: Express all variables in terms of one variable (e.g., a)
# From equation 1: b = a - 2
# From equation 2: c = b - 1 = (a - 2) - 1 = a - 3
# From equation 3: d = c - 1 = (a - 3) - 1 = a - 4
# From equation 4: e = d - 1 = (a - 4) - 1 = a - 5
# From equation 5: f = e - 1 = (a - 5) - 1 = a - 6

# Step 3: Substitute into equation 6 to solve for a
# f - a = 6
# (a - 6) - a = 6
# -6 = 6  --> This simplifies to a = 12

# Step 4: Calculate the values of b, c, d, e, f
a = 12  # Well depth in zhang
b = a - 2  # Rope length for family A
c = b - 1  # Rope length for family B
d = c - 1  # Rope length for family C
e = d - 1  # Rope length for family D
f = e - 1  # Rope length for family E

# Step 5: Convert f to chi (1 zhang = 10 chi)
f_chi = f * 10

# Output the results
井深 = a
甲綆長 = b
乙綆長 = c
丙綆長 = d
丁綆長 = e
戊綆長 = f_chi

print(f"井深: {井深}丈")
print(f"甲綆長: {甲綆長}丈")
print(f"乙綆長: {乙綆長}丈")
print(f"丙綆長: {丙綆長}丈")
print(f"丁綆長: {丁綆長}丈")
print(f"戊綆長: {戊綆長}尺")

"""


### Final Answer:
- 井深 (Well depth): `12丈`
- 甲綆長 (Rope length for family A): `10丈`
- 乙綆長 (Rope length for family B): `9丈`
- 丙綆長 (Rope length for family C): `8丈`
- 丁綆長 (Rope length for family D): `7丈`
- 戊綆長 (Rope length for family E): `6丈` or `60尺`
