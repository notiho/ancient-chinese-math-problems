Suppose there is a valley with the following dimensions:
- Top width: 2 zhang
- Top length: 7 zhang
- Bottom width: 8 chi
- Bottom length: 4 zhang
- Depth: 6 zhang and 5 chi.

Question 1: What is the total volume of the valley?
Answer: 52000 cubic chi.

Additionally:
- The soil is transported back and forth over 200 bu.
- The distance between the loading and unloading points is 1 li.
- The total journey is 58 li.
- There are 6 people sharing a cart.
- Each cart carries 34 chi and 7 cun of soil.

Question 2: How many cubic chi does each person transport, and how many people are required to complete the task?

The procedure says:
- Multiply the volume of one cartload by the total journey in bu to obtain the dividend.
- Add the back-and-forth distance (200 bu) to the 1 li distance between loading and unloading points.
- Multiply this sum by the 6 people sharing the cart to obtain the divisor.
- Divide the dividend by the divisor to find the volume transported by one person.
- Divide the total volume by the volume transported by one person to find the number of people required.

Answer: Each person transports *a* cubic chi, and *b* people are required.
