This problem involves solving a system of linear equations using the ancient Chinese method described in the "Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art." The problem is essentially about determining the weights of one sheaf of each type of grain (甲, 乙, 丙) based on their relationships and total weight.

Here is the solution encoded in Python:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Problem setup
# Let x = weight of one sheaf of 甲禾 (in 石)
# Let y = weight of one sheaf of 乙禾 (in 石)
# Let z = weight of one sheaf of 丙禾 (in 石)

# Equations derived from the problem:
# 1. 2x = y
# 2. 3y = z
# 3. 4z = x

# Solve the system of equations step by step using the described method:

# Step 1: Express y in terms of x from the first equation
y = Fraction(2, 1) * x

# Step 2: Express z in terms of y from the second equation
z = Fraction(3, 1) * y

# Step 3: Substitute y and z into the third equation to solve for x
x = Fraction(4, 1) * z

# Step 4: Back-substitute to find y and z
y = Fraction(2, 1) * x
z = Fraction(3, 1) * y

# Final results
a = x
b = y
c = z

# Output the results
print(f"甲禾一秉重 {a} 石")
print(f"乙禾一秉重 {b} 石")
print(f"丙禾一秉重 {c} 石")
