Suppose there is a square city whose size is unknown.
From the center of the city, exiting the north gate and walking 30 bu, there is a tree.
Exiting the west gate and walking 750 bu, the tree is visible.
Question: what is the side length of the square city?

The procedure says: Multiply the number of steps from the two gates with each other.
Then multiply the result by 4, obtaining the dividend.
Take the square root of the dividend, and divide it by 1000 (to convert to li), obtaining the side length of the city.

The answer says: *a* li.
