Suppose there is a trench with the following dimensions:
- Top width: 1 zhang 6 chi 3 cun
- Bottom width: 1 zhang
- Depth: 6 chi 3 cun
- Length: 13 zhang 2 chi 1 cun

Question 1: What is the total volume of the trench in cubic chi?
Answer: 10943 chi 8 cun.

Additionally:
- The standard labor capacity per person is 871 cubic chi.
- The work for removing soil is 1/5 of the total.
- The work for sand, gravel, water, and stones is slightly more than half (太半).
- The adjusted labor capacity is 232 chi and 4/15 chi.

Question 2: How many workers are required to complete the task?
Procedure: 
1. Start with the standard labor capacity per person.
2. Subtract the work for removing soil (1/5).
3. Subtract the work for sand, gravel, water, and stones (slightly more than half).
4. The remainder is the divisor.
5. Use the total trench volume as the dividend.
6. Divide the dividend by the divisor to get the number of workers.

Answer: *a* workers.
