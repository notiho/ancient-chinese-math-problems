This is a complex ancient Chinese mathematical problem involving the calculation of the dimensions of a square granary and a circular pit based on the given volume of grain. Below is the translation of the procedure into Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

"""
Suppose there are 16,348 shi and 8 dou of grain. It is desired to construct a square granary and a circular pit, with the height and depth being equal.
The side of the square is 1 zhang less than the diameter of the circle, and 5 chi more than the height.
The hu unit is 2 chi 5 cun, and the ratio of the circumference to the diameter is 22/7.
Question: what are the side length, height, and diameter?

The procedure says:
1. Multiply 14 by the hu unit and then multiply by the grain volume. Treat 89 and 1 as the divisor to obtain the volume.
2. Double the "more" value and add the "less" value. Multiply by the "less" value. Multiply by 33 and divide by 89 and 1. Square the "more" value, add it, and this becomes the square divisor.
3. Double the "less" value, multiply by 33, and divide by 89 and 1. Double the "more" value, add it, and this becomes the circular divisor.
4. Extract the cube root and divide. This gives the height. Add the difference to obtain the side length and the diameter.

The answer says: the side length is *a* zhang, the height is *b* zhang, and the diameter is *c* zhang.

### Explanation:
1. **粟 (Grain Volume)**: The total grain volume is converted into dou for consistency.
2. **斛法 (Hu Unit)**: The unit of measurement is converted into chi.
3. **實 (Volume)**: The total volume is calculated using the given formula.
4. **方法 (Square Divisor)**: The divisor for the square granary is calculated based on the "less" and "more" values.
5. **廉法 (Circular Divisor)**: The divisor for the circular pit is calculated similarly.
6. **高深 (Height/Depth)**: The cube root of the volume divided by the divisors gives the height/depth.
7. **方 (Square Side Length)** and **圓徑 (Circular Diameter)**: These are calculated by adding the "less" and "more" values to the height.

The results `a`, `b`, and `c` represent the side length of the square granary, the height/depth, and the diameter of the circular pit, respectively.
