This is a complex ancient Chinese mathematical problem involving the calculation of the dimensions of a square granary and a circular pit based on a given volume of grain. Let's translate the procedure into Python step by step.

### Problem Description:
We are given:
- A volume of grain: 16,348 shi and 8 dou.
- A square granary and a circular pit are to be constructed with equal height/depth.
- The side length of the square granary is 1 zhang less than the diameter of the circular pit.
- The side length of the square granary is 5 chi more than the height/depth.
- The volume formula for a cylinder is used for the circular pit, and the volume formula for a cube is used for the square granary.
- The "斛法" (hu method) is given as 2 chi 5 cun (2.5 chi).
- The ratio of the circumference to the diameter is given as 22/7.

We need to calculate:
- The side length of the square granary (方, `a` zhang),
- The height/depth (高深, `b` zhang),
- The diameter of the circular pit (圓徑, `c` zhang).

### Procedure:
The procedure involves several steps, including multiplying, squaring, and solving a cubic equation. Let's implement this step by step.

# Step 1: 以一十四乘斛法，以乘粟數，如八十九而一為實
實 = Fraction(14, 1) * 斛法 * 粟總斗 / Fraction(89, 1)

# Step 2: 倍多加少，以乘少數，三十三乘之，八十九而一
少數 = Fraction(33, 1) * Fraction(89, 1)
倍多加少 = 2 * 少數

# Step 3: 多自乘，加之為方法
方法 = 少數**2 + 倍多加少

# Step 4: 又倍少數，以三十三乘之，八十九而一，倍多加之為廉法
廉法 = 2 * 少數 * Fraction(33, 1) * Fraction(89, 1) + 倍多加少

# Step 5: 從開立方除之，即高深
高深 = pow(float(實 / 方法), 1/3)

# Step 6: 高深各加差，即方徑
方 = 高深 + Fraction(5, 10)  # 方 = 高深 + 5 chi = 高深 + 0.5 zhang
圓徑 = 方 + 1  # 圓徑 = 方 + 1 zhang

# Convert results to zhang
a = 方
b = 高深
c = 圓徑

# Output the results
a, b, c

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Volume Conversion**: The total volume of grain is converted into dou (1 shi = 10 dou).
2. **Hu Method**: The given hu method (斛法) is used to calculate the effective volume.
3. **Mathematical Operations**: The procedure involves multiplying, squaring, and solving a cubic equation to find the height/depth.
4. **Final Dimensions**: The side length of the square granary and the diameter of the circular pit are calculated based on the relationships given in the problem.

### Answer:
- 方 (Square side length): `a` zhang,
- 高深 (Height/Depth): `b` zhang,
- 圓徑 (Circular diameter): `c` zhang.
