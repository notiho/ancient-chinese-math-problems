This is a complex ancient Chinese mathematical problem involving the extraction of a cube root for a given volume. The procedure is described in detail, and I will translate it into Python code step by step.

The problem states:  
There is a volume of 63401 chi and 447/512 chi³.  
Question: What is the side length of the cube?

The procedure for extracting the cube root says:  
1. Place the volume as the dividend.  
2. Borrow a trial number (guess) and cube it. Compare it to the volume to determine the range.  
3. Multiply the trial number by itself and then by 3 to form the divisor. Divide the volume by this divisor.  
4. Continue iterating by refining the trial number and recalculating until the cube root is found.  
5. If the volume has fractions, convert them into a common denominator and include them in the calculation.  

The answer will be *a* chi.

Here is the Python implementation:

This code follows the ancient procedure step by step, iteratively refining the cube root until the exact value is found. If the cube root cannot be determined exactly, the procedure will indicate that it is not possible to extract the cube root.
