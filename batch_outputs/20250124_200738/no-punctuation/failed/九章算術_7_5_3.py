Suppose a group of people jointly buys sheep. 
When each person contributes 5, they are short by 45.
When each person contributes 7, they have an excess of 3.
Question: how many people are there, and what is the price of the sheep?

The procedure for "two excesses and two deficits" says: 
Place the contribution rates, and the excess or deficit amounts, each below their corresponding rate.
Let them be multiplied by their respective contribution rates.
Subtract the smaller result from the larger result, and the remainder becomes the dividend.
For the divisor, subtract the smaller excess/deficit from the larger excess/deficit.
Divide the dividend by the divisor, and the result is the number of people.
If there is a remainder, reduce it to a fraction.

The answer says: *a* people, and the price of the sheep is *b*.
