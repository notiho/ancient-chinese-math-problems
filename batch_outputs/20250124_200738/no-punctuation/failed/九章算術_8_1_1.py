This problem involves solving a system of equations using ancient Chinese methods, specifically the "fangcheng" (方程) procedure, which is an early form of linear algebra. Let's carefully translate the procedure into Python code.

The problem involves two types of grain, "upper grain" (上禾) and "lower grain" (下禾), and their respective yields per bundle (秉). The goal is to determine the yield of one bundle of each type of grain.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Given Conditions:**
   - 7 bundles of upper grain lose 1 dou of yield, and when combined with 2 bundles of lower grain, the total yield is 10 dou.
   - 8 bundles of lower grain gain 1 dou of yield, and when combined with 2 bundles of upper grain, the total yield is 10 dou.

2. **Procedure:**
   - Use the fangcheng method to solve the system of equations.
   - The key insight is that "losing 1 dou" means the actual yield is greater than the stated value, and "gaining 1 dou" means the actual yield is less than the stated value.

### Translation into Python Code:

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given conditions
# Equation 1: 7 bundles of upper grain lose 1 dou, combined with 2 bundles of lower grain, total yield is 10 dou.
# Equation 2: 8 bundles of lower grain gain 1 dou, combined with 2 bundles of upper grain, total yield is 10 dou.

# Representing the system of equations:
# Let x = yield of one bundle of upper grain (上禾)
# Let y = yield of one bundle of lower grain (下禾)
# Equation 1: 7(x + 1) + 2y = 10
# Equation 2: 2x + 8(y - 1) = 10

# Step 1: Expand and simplify the equations
# Equation 1: 7x + 7 + 2y = 10 -> 7x + 2y = 3
# Equation 2: 2x + 8y - 8 = 10 -> 2x + 8y = 18

# Step 2: Solve the system of equations using fangcheng (elimination method)
# Multiply Equation 1 by 4 to align coefficients of y
# 4(7x + 2y) = 4(3) -> 28x + 8y = 12
# Subtract Equation 2 from the result
# (28x + 8y) - (2x + 8y) = 12 - 18
# 26x = -6
x = Fraction(-6, 26)  # Simplify to x = -3/13

# Substitute x back into Equation 1 to solve for y
# 7x + 2y = 3
# 7(-3/13) + 2y = 3
# -21/13 + 2y = 3
# 2y = 3 + 21/13
# 2y = 39/13 + 21/13
# 2y = 60/13
y = Fraction(60, 26)  # Simplify to y = 30/13

# Final results
a = x  # Yield of one bundle of upper grain
b = y  # Yield of one bundle of lower grain

# Output the results
a, b

### Explanation of the Code:
1. The system of equations is derived from the problem's conditions.
2. The equations are solved using the elimination method, as described in the fangcheng procedure.
3. The results are expressed as fractions to maintain precision.

### Answer:
- The yield of one bundle of upper grain (上禾) is `a = -3/13` dou.
- The yield of one bundle of lower grain (下禾) is `b = 30/13` dou.
