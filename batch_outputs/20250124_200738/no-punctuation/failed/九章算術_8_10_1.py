Suppose there are two horses and one ox, and their total price exceeds 10,000 qian.
If the price of half a horse is added to the price of one horse and two oxen, the total price is less than 10,000 qian.
If the price of half an ox is added, what are the prices of the ox and the horse?

The procedure says: Solve this using the method of simultaneous equations and the method of balancing losses and gains.

The method of simultaneous equations says:
1. Place the coefficients of the equations (upper, middle, lower) and the total (right side) in a table.
2. Multiply the upper row by the middle row and divide by the diagonal coefficient, then proceed similarly for the next steps.
3. Use the results to calculate the values of the unknowns.

Answer: The price of a horse is *a* qian, and the price of an ox is *b* qian.

# Define the coefficients and constants of the equations
# Equation 1: 2 horses + 1 ox = 10,000 qian
# Equation 2: 1.5 horses + 2 oxen = 10,000 qian
# Coefficients for the equations:
# Upper row (horse coefficient): 2
# Middle row (ox coefficient): 1
# Lower row (constant): 10,000

# Upper row (horse coefficient)
上禾 = 2

# Middle row (ox coefficient)
中禾 = 1

# Lower row (constant)
下禾 = 10000
