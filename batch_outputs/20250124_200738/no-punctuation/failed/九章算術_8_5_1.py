Suppose there are 3 bundles of upper millet, which increase the yield by 6 dou, equivalent to 10 bundles of lower millet.
And 5 bundles of lower millet, which increase the yield by 1 dou, equivalent to 2 bundles of upper millet.
Question: how much yield does one bundle of upper millet and one bundle of lower millet produce?

The procedure says: Treat it as a system of linear equations.
Set 3 bundles of upper millet as positive, 10 bundles of lower millet as negative, and 6 dou as negative.
Next, set 2 bundles of upper millet as negative, 5 bundles of lower millet as positive, and 1 dou as negative.
Use the positive-negative procedure to solve.

The method for solving systems of equations says: Place 3 bundles of upper millet, 2 bundles of middle millet, and 1 bundle of lower millet, with the total yield of 39 dou on the right-hand side.
Align the left-hand side variables as on the right-hand side.
Use the right row to multiply the upper millet row, and divide directly.
Then multiply the next row and divide directly again.
For the middle millet, multiply the middle row by the left row and divide directly.
For the lower millet, if it does not divide evenly, use the upper row as the divisor and the lower row as the dividend.
The result is the yield of the lower millet.
To find the middle millet, multiply the middle row by the divisor and divide by the lower millet's yield.
The remainder corresponds to the middle millet's yield.
To find the upper millet, multiply the right row by the divisor and divide by the lower and middle millet's yield.
The remainder corresponds to the upper millet's yield.
The results are all according to the method, and each yields 1 dou.

Answer: one bundle of upper millet produces *a* dou, and one bundle of lower millet produces *b* dou.
