Suppose there are 3 bundles of upper millet, which yield an additional 6 dou of grain, equivalent to 10 bundles of lower millet.
And 5 bundles of lower millet yield an additional 1 dou of grain, equivalent to 2 bundles of upper millet.
Question: how much grain does one bundle of upper millet and one bundle of lower millet yield?

The procedure says: Treat this as a system of linear equations.
Set up the first equation with 3 bundles of upper millet as positive, 10 bundles of lower millet as negative, and 6 dou of grain as negative.
Set up the second equation with 2 bundles of upper millet as negative, 5 bundles of lower millet as positive, and 1 dou of grain as negative.
Use the positive-negative procedure to solve.

The method for solving systems of linear equations says:
1. Place the coefficients of the upper millet, middle millet (if applicable), lower millet, and the grain on the right-hand side.
2. Multiply the rows to eliminate variables step by step, dividing by the coefficients as necessary.
3. Solve for the remaining variables by substitution.

The answer says: one bundle of upper millet yields *a* dou, and one bundle of lower millet yields *b* dou.
