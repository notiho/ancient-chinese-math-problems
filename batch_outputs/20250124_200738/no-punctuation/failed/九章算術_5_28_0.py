Suppose there is a valley with the following dimensions:
- The top width is 2 zhang, and the top length is 7 zhang.
- The bottom width is 8 chi, and the bottom length is 4 zhang.
- The depth is 6 zhang and 5 chi.

Question 1: What is the total volume of the valley?
Answer: 52000 cubic chi.

Additionally:
- The soil is transported back and forth for 200 bu.
- The distance between the loading and unloading points is 1 li.
- The total journey is 58 li.
- 6 people share a cart, and the cart carries 34 chi and 7 cun of soil.

Question 2: How much soil does each person transport, and how many people are required to transport the total soil?

The procedure says:
- Multiply the volume of one cart by the total journey in bu to get the dividend.
- Add the round-trip bu and the 1 li distance, and multiply by the 6 people per cart to get the divisor.
- Divide the dividend by the divisor to get the amount of soil transported by one person.
- Divide the total soil volume by the amount transported by one person to get the number of people required.

Answer: Each person transports *a* cubic chi, and *b* people are required.
