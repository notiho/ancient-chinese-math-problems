Divide each result by the southward rate to get the respective distances.\n\nAnswer: Jia exits the south gate and walks *a* bu south, *b* bu northeast diagonally, and Yi walks *c* bu east.\n\"\"\"\n\n# \u57ce\u9091\u65b9\u5341\u91cc\n\u9091\u65b9 = 10\n\n# \u7532\u884c\u4e94\uff0c\u4e59\u884c\u4e09\n\u7532\u7387 = 5\n\u4e59\u7387 = 3\n\n# \u4ee4\u4e94\u81ea\u4e58\uff0c\u4e09\u4ea6\u81ea\u4e58\uff0c\u5e76\u800c\u534a\u4e4b\uff0c\u70ba\u90aa\u884c\u7387\n\u90aa\u884c\u7387 = Fraction((\u7532\u7387**2 + \u4e59\u7387**2), 2)\n\n# \u90aa\u884c\u7387\u6e1b\u65bc\u4e94\u81ea\u4e58\u8005\uff0c\u9918\u70ba\u5357\u884c\u7387\n\u5357\u884c\u7387 = \u90aa\u884c\u7387 - \u7532\u7387**2\n\n# \u4ee5\u4e09\u4e58\u4e94\uff0c\u70ba\u4e59\u6771\u884c\u7387\n\u6771\u884c\u7387 = \u4e59\u7387 * \u7532\u7387\n\n# \u7f6e\u9091\u65b9\u534a\u4e4b\n\u9091\u65b9\u534a = Fraction(\u9091\u65b9, 2)\n\n# \u4ee5\u5357\u884c\u7387\u4e58\u4e4b\uff0c\u5982\u6771\u884c\u7387\u800c\u4e00\uff0c\u5373\u5f97\u51fa\u5357\u9580\u6b65\u6578\n\u5357\u9580\u6b65\u6578 = Fraction(\u9091\u65b9\u534a * \u5357\u884c\u7387, \u6771\u884c\u7387)\n\n# \u4ee5\u589e\u9091\u65b9\u534a\uff0c\u5373\u5357\u884c\n\u5357\u884c = \u5357\u9580\u6b65\u6578 + \u9091\u65b9\u534a\n\n# \u7f6e\u5357\u884c\u6b65\uff0c\u6c42\u5f26\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u90aa\u884c\u7387\u4e58\u4e4b\n\u5f26\u6b65 = Fraction(\u90aa\u884c\u7387 * \u5357\u884c, \u5357\u884c\u7387)\n\n# \u6c42\u6771\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u6771\u884c\u7387\u4e58\u4e4b\n\u6771\u6b65 = Fraction(\u6771\u884c\u7387 * \u5357\u884c, \u5357\u884c\u7387)\n\n# \u5404\u81ea\u70ba\u5be6\uff0c\u5be6\u5982\u5357\u884c\u7387\u5f97\u4e00\u6b65\na = \u5357\u884c\nb = \u5f26\u6b65\nc = \u6771\u6b65", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1919, "completion_tokens": 3158, "total_tokens": 5077, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ec7eab8ec3"}}, "error": null}
