Suppose there is an area of 300 bu.
Question: what is the circumference of the circle?

The procedure for circles says: Place the number of bu for the area.
Multiply it by 12.
Extract the square root and divide by it, obtaining the circumference.

Answer: *a* bu.

# Since Python does not have a built-in square root function without external libraries, we approximate the square root manually using an iterative method.
