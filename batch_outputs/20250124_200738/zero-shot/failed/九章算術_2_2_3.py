"""
今有粟四斗五升，欲為鑿米。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求鑿米，十二之，二十五而一。
荅曰：為鑿米 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much "鑿米" (refined rice) can be obtained from 4斗5升 of "粟" (unrefined grain). The method described in the problem says to divide the amount of 粟 by 12 and then multiply by 1/25.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given 粟 amount
粟 = Fraction(4, 1) + Fraction(5, 10)  # 4斗5升 = 4斗 + 5升 (1斗 = 10升)

# Conversion to 鑿米
a = 粟 / 12 * Fraction(1, 25)

# Result
a  # 鑿米 in 斗
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 鑿米 in 斗 as a `Fraction`.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 54/25, Actual: 3/200"""
