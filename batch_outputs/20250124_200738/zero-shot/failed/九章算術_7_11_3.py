今有垣厚五尺，兩鼠對穿。大鼠日一尺，小鼠亦日一尺。大鼠日自倍，小鼠日自半。問︰幾何日相逢？各穿幾何？
術曰：假令二日，不足五寸。令之三日，有餘三尺七寸半。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰： a日 。大鼠穿 b尺 ，小鼠穿 c尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves two mice digging through a wall of thickness 5 feet. The larger mouse doubles its daily progress each day, while the smaller mouse halves its daily progress each day. We need to determine how many days it takes for them to meet and how far each mouse has dug.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Wall thickness
wall_thickness = 5  # in feet

# Define the rates of the mice
large_mouse_rate = 1  # in feet per day
small_mouse_rate = 1  # in feet per day

# Define the daily progress multiplier
large_mouse_multiplier = 2  # doubles daily
small_mouse_multiplier = Fraction(1, 2)  # halves daily

# Initialize variables
large_mouse_distance = 0  # distance dug by the large mouse
small_mouse_distance = 0  # distance dug by the small mouse
days = 0

# Simulate the digging process
while large_mouse_distance + small_mouse_distance < wall_thickness:
    days += 1
    # Update distances dug by each mouse
    large_mouse_distance += large_mouse_rate
    small_mouse_distance += small_mouse_rate
    # Update the rates for the next day
    large_mouse_rate *= large_mouse_multiplier
    small_mouse_rate *= small_mouse_multiplier

# Assign the results to the variables
a = days
b = large_mouse_distance
c = small_mouse_distance

# Output the results
a, b, c

"""


### Explanation:
1. **Wall Thickness**: The wall is 5 feet thick.
2. **Rates**: Both mice start digging at 1 foot per day. The large mouse doubles its rate daily, while the small mouse halves its rate daily.
3. **Simulation**: We simulate the digging process day by day, updating the distances dug by each mouse and their respective rates.
4. **Stopping Condition**: The simulation stops when the combined distance dug by both mice equals or exceeds the wall thickness.
5. **Results**: The number of days (`a`), the distance dug by the large mouse (`b`), and the distance dug by the small mouse (`c`) are computed.

### Output:
The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will contain the answers:
- `a`: Number of days it takes for the mice to meet.
- `b`: Distance dug by the large mouse.
- `c`: Distance dug by the small mouse.
