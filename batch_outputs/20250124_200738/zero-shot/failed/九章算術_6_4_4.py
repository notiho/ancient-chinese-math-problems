今有粟七斗，三人分舂之，一人為糲米，一人為粺米，一人為鑿米，令米數等。問︰取粟為米各幾何？
術曰：列置糲米三十，粺米二十七，鑿米二十四，而反衰之，副并為法。以七斗乘未并者，各自為取粟實。實如法得一斗。若求米等者，以本率各乘定所取粟為實，以粟率五十為法，實如法得一斗。
荅曰：糲米取粟 a斗 。粺米取粟 b斗 。鑿米取粟 c斗 。為米各 d斗 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves distributing 7斗 of grain among three people to produce three types of rice (糲米, 粺米, 鑿米) such that the resulting rice quantities are equal. The conversion rates for each type of rice are given as 30, 27, and 24 units of rice per 50 units of grain, respectively.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total grain available
total_grain = 7  # in 斗

# Conversion rates (per 50 units of grain)
rate_li = 30  # 糲米
rate_bai = 27  # 粺米
rate_zao = 24  # 鑿米

# The sum of the rates
rate_sum = rate_li + rate_bai + rate_zao

# Calculate the amount of grain each person takes
a = Fraction(rate_li, rate_sum) * total_grain  # 糲米取粟
b = Fraction(rate_bai, rate_sum) * total_grain  # 粺米取粟
c = Fraction(rate_zao, rate_sum) * total_grain  # 鑿米取粟

# Calculate the amount of rice produced by each person
d = Fraction(rate_li, 50) * a  # 米 produced by each person (equal for all)

# Results
a, b, c, d

### Explanation:
1. **Conversion Rates**: The rates for 糲米, 粺米, and 鑿米 are given as 30, 27, and 24 units of rice per 50 units of grain, respectively.
2. **Proportional Distribution**: The grain is distributed among the three people in proportion to their conversion rates. The total of the rates is `30 + 27 + 24 = 81`.
3. **Grain Allocation**: Each person's share of the grain is calculated as `(rate / rate_sum) * total_grain`.
4. **Rice Production**: The amount of rice produced by each person is calculated using their respective conversion rates.

### Output:
The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will contain the following values:
- `a`: Amount of grain taken by the person producing 糲米.
- `b`: Amount of grain taken by the person producing 粺米.
- `c`: Amount of grain taken by the person producing 鑿米.
- `d`: Amount of rice produced by each person (equal for all).
