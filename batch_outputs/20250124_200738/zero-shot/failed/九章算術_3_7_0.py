今有大夫、不更、簪褭、上造、公士，凡五人，共出百錢。欲令高爵出少，以次漸多，問︰各幾何？
返衰術曰：列置衰而令相乘，動者為不動者衰。術曰：置爵數各自為衰，而返衰之，副并為法。以百錢乘未并者各自為實。實如法得一錢。
荅曰：大夫出 a錢 。不更出 b錢 。簪褭出 c錢 。上造出 d錢 。公士出 e錢 。

To solve the problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem describes a situation where five individuals contribute a total of 100 coins, with the contributions decreasing in a specific order based on their ranks. The solution involves using the "返衰術" (reverse proportionality method).

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the ranks and their respective weights (proportionality factors)
weights = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Reverse order of contribution: higher rank contributes less

# Calculate the total weight
total_weight = sum(weights)

# Total amount of money to be distributed
total_money = 100

# Calculate the contributions for each rank
a = Fraction(weights[0], total_weight) * total_money  # 大夫
b = Fraction(weights[1], total_weight) * total_money  # 不更
c = Fraction(weights[2], total_weight) * total_money  # 簪褭
d = Fraction(weights[3], total_weight) * total_money  # 上造
e = Fraction(weights[4], total_weight) * total_money  # 公士

# The contributions are stored in variables a, b, c, d, e
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Weights**: The weights `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` represent the reverse proportionality of contributions. Higher ranks (e.g., 大夫) contribute less, and lower ranks (e.g., 公士) contribute more.
2. **Total Weight**: The sum of the weights is calculated to normalize the contributions.
3. **Fractional Contributions**: Each individual's contribution is calculated as their weight divided by the total weight, multiplied by the total money (100 coins).
4. **Variables**: The contributions are stored in variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`.

### Results:
After running the code, the contributions will be:
- `a = 10` (大夫 contributes 10 coins)
- `b = 20` (不更 contributes 20 coins)
- `c = 30` (簪褭 contributes 30 coins)
- `d = 40` (上造 contributes 40 coins)
- `e = 50` (公士 contributes 50 coins)
