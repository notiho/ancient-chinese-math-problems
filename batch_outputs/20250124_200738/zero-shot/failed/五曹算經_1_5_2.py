今有鼓田两頭各廣四十步中央廣五十二步從八十五步。問：為田㡬何？
術曰：并三廣得一百三十二步以三除之得四十四步以從八十五步乘之得三千七百四十步以畝法除之即得。
答曰： a畝 奇 b步 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem describes a trapezoidal field where the two parallel sides are 40 steps and 52 steps wide, and the height (distance between the parallel sides) is 85 steps. The goal is to compute the area of the field in terms of "畝" (mu) and "步" (steps).

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
side1 = 40  # steps (廣四十步)
side2 = 52  # steps (廣五十二步)
height = 85  # steps (從八十五步)

# Step 1: Compute the average width
average_width = Fraction(side1 + side2, 2)  # (40 + 52) / 2 = 44 steps

# Step 2: Compute the area in square steps
area_in_steps = average_width * height  # 44 * 85 = 3740 square steps

# Step 3: Convert the area to 畝 and 步
# 1 畝 = 240 square steps
mu = area_in_steps // 240  # Integer division to find 畝
remaining_steps = area_in_steps % 240  # Remainder in square steps

# Assign the answers to variables
a = mu  # 畝
b = remaining_steps  # 步

# Output the results
a, b

"""


### Explanation:
1. **Average Width**: The average width of the trapezoid is calculated as the mean of the two parallel sides: `(40 + 52) / 2 = 44`.
2. **Area in Square Steps**: The area of the trapezoid is calculated as `average_width * height = 44 * 85 = 3740`.
3. **Conversion to 畝 and 步**: Since 1 畝 = 240 square steps, we divide the total area by 240 to find the number of 畝 (integer part) and the remaining square steps (remainder).

### Final Answer:
The area of the field is stored in variables `a` (畝) and `b` (步).
