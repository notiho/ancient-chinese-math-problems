今有粟二斗一升，欲為粺米。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求粺米，二十七之，五十而一。
荅曰：為粺米 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much 粺米 (refined rice) can be obtained from 粟 (unrefined rice). The problem states that for every 27 units of 粟, we get 1 unit of 粺米. The given amount of 粟 is 2斗1升. 

In ancient Chinese measurements:
- 1斗 = 10升.

Thus, 2斗1升 = 2 * 10 + 1 = 21升.

Now, we calculate the amount of 粺米 using the given ratio (27 units of 粟 produce 1 unit of 粺米). The formula is:

粺米 = 粟 / 27

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
粟 = 21  # in 升

# Calculation
a = Fraction(粟, 27)  # 粺米 in 斗

# Result
a  # 粺米 in 斗
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 粺米 in 斗 as a fraction.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 567/500, Actual: 7/9"""
