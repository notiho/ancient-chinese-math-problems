今有共買牛，七家共出一百九十，不足三百三十；九家共出二百七十，盈三十。問︰家數、牛價各幾何？
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰： a家 ，牛價 b 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical method into Python code. The problem involves finding the number of families (`a`) and the price of a cow (`b`).

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
rate1 = 7  # Seven families
total1 = 190  # Total money contributed by seven families
shortfall = 330 - total1  # Shortfall for seven families

rate2 = 9  # Nine families
total2 = 270  # Total money contributed by nine families
excess = total2 - 330  # Excess for nine families

# Step 1: Multiply the rates by their respective shortfall or excess
product1 = rate1 * shortfall
product2 = rate2 * excess

# Step 2: Add the shortfall and excess
combined_difference = shortfall + excess

# Step 3: Calculate the number of families (a)
a = Fraction(product1 + product2, combined_difference)

# Step 4: Calculate the price of a cow (b)
b = Fraction(330, a)

# Results
a = a  # Number of families
b = b  # Price of a cow

# Output the results
a, b

"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input the given data**: The number of families and their contributions, as well as the shortfall and excess.
2. **Calculate the products**: Multiply the number of families by their respective shortfall or excess.
3. **Combine the shortfall and excess**: Add these values together to form the denominator.
4. **Solve for `a` (number of families)**: Use the formula provided in the ancient text to compute the number of families.
5. **Solve for `b` (price of a cow)**: Divide the total price of the cows (330) by the number of families (`a`).

### Solution:
The variables `a` and `b` will contain the number of families and the price of a cow, respectively.
