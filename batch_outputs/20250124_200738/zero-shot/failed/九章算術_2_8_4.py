今有粟八斗六升，欲為鑿飯。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求鑿飯，二十四之，二十五而一。
荅曰：為鑿飯 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of "鑿飯" (a type of processed grain) obtained from 8斗6升 of raw grain (粟). The method provided states that for every 24 units of raw grain, 25 units of processed grain are produced.

### Steps:
1. Convert 8斗6升 into a single unit for calculation. Since 1斗 = 10升, 8斗6升 = \( 8 \times 10 + 6 = 86 \)升.
2. Use the given ratio: for every 24 units of raw grain, 25 units of processed grain are produced. This means the processed grain is \( \frac{25}{24} \) times the raw grain.
3. Multiply the total raw grain (86升) by \( \frac{25}{24} \) to find the amount of processed grain.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
raw_grain = Fraction(86)  # 8斗6升 = 86升
conversion_ratio = Fraction(25, 24)  # 25 processed units for every 24 raw units

# Calculate processed grain
a = raw_grain * conversion_ratio  # Amount of processed grain in 升

# Result
a  # This is the amount of processed grain in 升
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of processed grain in 升.

"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 1032/125, Actual: 1075/12"""
