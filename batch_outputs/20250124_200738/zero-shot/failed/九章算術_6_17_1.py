今有五人分五錢，令上二人所得與下三人等。問︰各得幾何？
術曰：置錢錐行衰，并上二人為九，并下三人為六。六少於九，三。以三均加焉，副并為法。以所分錢乘未并者各自為實。實如法得一錢。
荅曰：甲得 a錢 ，乙得 b錢 ，丙得 c錢 ，丁得 d錢 ，戊得 e錢 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem states that five people are dividing five units of money such that the sum of the amounts received by the first two people equals the sum of the amounts received by the last three people. We need to determine how much each person receives.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total money to be divided
total_money = 5

# Let the amounts received by the five people be:
# a = money received by person 1 (甲)
# b = money received by person 2 (乙)
# c = money received by person 3 (丙)
# d = money received by person 4 (丁)
# e = money received by person 5 (戊)

# The conditions are:
# 1. a + b + c + d + e = total_money
# 2. a + b = c + d + e

# From condition 2, we can express c + d + e as a + b.
# Substituting this into condition 1:
# a + b + (a + b) = total_money
# 2a + 2b = total_money
# a + b = total_money / 2

# Now, the total money for the first two people (a + b) is 5/2,
# and the total money for the last three people (c + d + e) is also 5/2.
# To divide the money equally among the five people:
a = Fraction(1, 1)  # Each person gets 1 unit of money
b = Fraction(1, 1)
c = Fraction(1, 1)
d = Fraction(1, 1)
e = Fraction(1, 1)

# Output the results
a, b, c, d, e
#----- content ends here -----

### Explanation:
- Each person receives exactly 1 unit of money because the total money (5 units) is divided equally among the five people.
- The condition that the sum of the first two people's money equals the sum of the last three people's money is satisfied because \(1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1\).
