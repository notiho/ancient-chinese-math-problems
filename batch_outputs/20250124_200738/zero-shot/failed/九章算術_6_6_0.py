今有取傭負鹽二斛，行一百里，與錢四十。今負鹽一斛七斗三升、少半升，行八十里。問︰與錢幾何？
術曰：置鹽二斛升數，以一百里乘之為法。以四十錢乘今負鹽升數，又以八十里乘之，為實。實如法得一錢。
荅曰： a錢 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the payment for carrying a certain amount of salt over a certain distance, based on a given rate.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
salt_1 = 2  # in hu (斛)
distance_1 = 100  # in li (里)
payment_1 = 40  # in qian (錢)

salt_2 = Fraction(1) + Fraction(7, 10) + Fraction(3, 100) - Fraction(1, 200)  # 1斛7斗3升少半升
distance_2 = 80  # in li (里)

# Calculation
# Convert salt_1 to sheng (升): 1 hu = 10 dou, 1 dou = 10 sheng
salt_1_sheng = salt_1 * 10 * 10  # 2斛 = 200升

# Total work for the first case (salt * distance)
work_1 = salt_1_sheng * distance_1

# Total work for the second case (salt * distance)
salt_2_sheng = salt_2 * 10 * 10  # Convert salt_2 to sheng
work_2 = salt_2_sheng * distance_2

# Payment per unit work
payment_per_work = Fraction(payment_1, work_1)

# Payment for the second case
a = work_2 * payment_per_work

# Output the result
a  # in qian (錢)
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. The problem provides a rate for carrying 2 hu (斛) of salt over 100 li (里) for 40 qian (錢).
2. The second case involves carrying 1 hu 7 dou 3 sheng minus half a sheng over 80 li.
3. We calculate the total work (salt amount in sheng multiplied by distance in li) for both cases.
4. Using the rate from the first case, we calculate the payment for the second case.

The result is stored in the variable `a`, which represents the payment in qian (錢).

Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 416/15, Actual: 138/5"""
