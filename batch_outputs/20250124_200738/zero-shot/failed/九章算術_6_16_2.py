今有金箠，長五尺。斬本一尺，重四斤。斬末一尺，重二斤。問︰次一尺各重幾何？
術曰：令末重減本重，餘即差率也。又置本重，以四間乘之，為下第一衰。副置，以差率減之，每尺各自為衰。副置下第一衰以為法，以本重四斤遍乘列衰，各自為實。實如法得一斤。
荅曰：末一尺，重 a斤 。次一尺， 重 b斤 。次一尺， 重 c斤 。次一尺， 重 d斤 。次一尺， 重 e斤

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves determining the weights of each subsequent section of a 5-foot-long gold rod, given the weights of the first and last sections.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_length = 5  # in feet
first_section_weight = 4  # in jin
last_section_weight = 2  # in jin

# Step 1: Calculate the rate of decrease (差率)
rate_of_decrease = Fraction(last_section_weight - first_section_weight, total_length - 1)

# Step 2: Calculate the weights of each section
a = first_section_weight  # weight of the first section
b = a + rate_of_decrease  # weight of the second section
c = b + rate_of_decrease  # weight of the third section
d = c + rate_of_decrease  # weight of the fourth section
e = d + rate_of_decrease  # weight of the fifth section

# The weights are now stored in variables a, b, c, d, and e
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Rate of Decrease (差率)**:
   The rate of decrease is calculated as the difference between the weight of the last section and the first section, divided by the number of intervals (total sections minus one).

2. **Weights of Each Section**:
   Starting with the weight of the first section (`a`), each subsequent section's weight is calculated by adding the rate of decrease to the previous section's weight.

### Results:
The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` will contain the weights of the sections in jin (斤).
