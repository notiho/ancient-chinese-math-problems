今有粟五斗、太半升，欲為麻。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求菽、答、麻、麥，皆九之，十而一。
荅曰：為麻 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to compute the amount of 麻 (a) obtained from 粟 (5斗 and 太半升). The rule states that to convert 粟 into 麻, we multiply the amount of 粟 by 9/10.

Here is the Python code to compute the value of "a":


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# 粟 amount: 5斗 and 太半升
# 1斗 = 10升, so 太半升 = 0.5升
粟 = Fraction(5 * 10 + 0.5, 10)  # Convert 粟 to a single unit in terms of 斗

# Conversion rule: 粟 to 麻 is 9/10
a = 粟 * Fraction(9, 10)

# Result
a  # This is the amount of 麻 in 斗
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the result in terms of 斗.
