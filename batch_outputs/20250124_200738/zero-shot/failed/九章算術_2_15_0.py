今有粟七斗八升，欲為豉。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求豉，六十三之，五十而一。
荅曰：為豉 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem states that there are 7斗8升 of 粟 (grain), and we want to calculate how much 豉 (fermented grain) can be made. The rule provided is that for every 63 units of 粟, 50 units of 豉 are produced.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
粟 = Fraction(7, 1) + Fraction(8, 10)  # 7斗8升, where 1斗 = 10升

# Conversion rule: 63 units of 粟 produce 50 units of 豉
a = 粟 * Fraction(50, 63)  # Calculate the amount of 豉

# The result is stored in variable 'a'
a  # Output the amount of 豉 in units of 斗
#----- content ends here -----


"""


Explanation:
1. The input 粟 is given as 7斗8升. Since 1斗 = 10升, we convert this to a fraction: \( 7 + \frac{8}{10} \).
2. The conversion rule states that 63 units of 粟 produce 50 units of 豉. Therefore, the amount of 豉 is calculated as \( \text{粟} \times \frac{50}{63} \).
3. The result is stored in the variable `a`, which represents the amount of 豉 in units of 斗.
