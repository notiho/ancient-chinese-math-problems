今有女子善織，日自倍，五日織通五尺。問：日織幾何？
術曰：各置列衰副，并得三十一為法，以五尺乘并者，各自為實，實如法而一，即得。
答曰：初日織 a寸 ，次日織 b寸 ，次日織 c寸 ，次日織 d尺 ，次日織 e尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem describes a woman weaving cloth, where the amount woven doubles each day, and the total woven in five days is 5 feet (or 60 inches, since 1 foot = 12 inches). We need to find how much she weaves each day.

The solution involves setting up the equations based on the doubling pattern and solving for the unknowns \(a, b, c, d, e\), which represent the amount woven each day in inches.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total woven in 5 days is 5 feet = 60 inches
total_inches = 60

# Let the amount woven each day be:
# Day 1: a inches
# Day 2: b inches = 2 * a
# Day 3: c inches = 2 * b = 4 * a
# Day 4: d inches = 2 * c = 8 * a
# Day 5: e inches = 2 * d = 16 * a

# Total woven in 5 days:
# a + b + c + d + e = total_inches
# a + 2a + 4a + 8a + 16a = total_inches
# 31a = total_inches

# Solve for a
a = Fraction(total_inches, 31)

# Calculate b, c, d, e
b = 2 * a
c = 4 * a
d = 8 * a
e = 16 * a

# The results are:
# a, b, c, d, e
#----- content ends here -----


"""


Now, the values of \(a, b, c, d, e\) are stored in the corresponding variables. These represent the amount woven each day in inches.
