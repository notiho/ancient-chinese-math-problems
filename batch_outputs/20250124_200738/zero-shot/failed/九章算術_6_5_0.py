今有人當稟粟二斛。倉無粟，欲與米一、菽二，以當所稟粟。問︰各幾何？
術曰：置米一、菽二求為粟之數。并之得三、九分之八，以為法。亦置米一、菽二，而以粟二斛乘之，各自為實。實如法得一斛。
荅曰：米 a斗 。菽 b斛 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the equivalent amounts of 米 (rice) and 菽 (beans) that correspond to 2 斛 (hu) of 粟 (millet). The solution involves using fractions to calculate the values.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
粟 = 2  # in 斛
米_ratio = Fraction(1, 1)  # 米 is 1 unit
菽_ratio = Fraction(2, 1)  # 菽 is 2 units

# Total ratio (米 + 菽)
total_ratio = 米_ratio + 菽_ratio  # 1 + 2 = 3

# 米 and 菽 equivalent to 粟
米 = 粟 * (米_ratio / total_ratio)  # 米 = 2 * (1 / 3)
菽 = 粟 * (菽_ratio / total_ratio)  # 菽 = 2 * (2 / 3)

# Results
a = 米  # 米 in 斗
b = 菽  # 菽 in 斛

# Output the results
a, b
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. The total ratio of 米 (rice) and 菽 (beans) is calculated as `1 + 2 = 3`.
2. The equivalent amount of 米 is calculated as `2 * (1 / 3) = 2/3`.
3. The equivalent amount of 菽 is calculated as `2 * (2 / 3) = 4/3`.
4. The results are stored in variables `a` (for 米) and `b` (for 菽).

### Final Answer:
- 米 `a = 2/3` 斗
- 菽 `b = 4/3` 斛
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 36/7, Actual: 2/3
Variable 'b' has wrong value. Expected: 36/35, Actual: 4/3"""
