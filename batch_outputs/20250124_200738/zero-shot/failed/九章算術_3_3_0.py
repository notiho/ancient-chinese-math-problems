今有女子善織，日自倍，五日織五尺。問︰日織幾何？
術曰：置一、二、四、八、十六為列衰，副并為法，以五尺乘未并者，各自為實，實如法得一尺。
荅曰：初日織 a寸 。次日織 b寸 。次日織 c寸 。次日織 d尺 。次日織 e尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem describes a scenario where a woman weaves cloth, doubling her output each day, and in five days, she weaves a total of 5 feet (or 60 inches, since 1 foot = 12 inches). We need to calculate how much she weaves each day.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total woven in 5 days = 5 feet = 60 inches
total_inches = 5 * 12

# The weaving doubles each day: 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x
# Let the amount woven on the first day be 'a' inches.
# Then, the amounts woven on subsequent days are: a, 2a, 4a, 8a, 16a.
# The total woven is: a + 2a + 4a + 8a + 16a = 31a.

# Solve for 'a'
a = Fraction(total_inches, 31)

# Calculate the amounts woven each day
b = 2 * a
c = 4 * a
d = 8 * a
e = 16 * a

# The results are:
# a: woven on the first day (in inches)
# b: woven on the second day (in inches)
# c: woven on the third day (in inches)
# d: woven on the fourth day (in inches)
# e: woven on the fifth day (in inches)

# Convert to feet for days 4 and 5
d = d / 12  # Convert to feet
e = e / 12  # Convert to feet
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Results:
- `a`: Amount woven on the first day (in inches)
- `b`: Amount woven on the second day (in inches)
- `c`: Amount woven on the third day (in inches)
- `d`: Amount woven on the fourth day (in feet)
- `e`: Amount woven on the fifth day (in feet)

This code calculates the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` as fractions, ensuring accuracy for non-integer results.
