今有東南望波口，立兩表南、北相去九丈，以索薄地連之。當北表之西卻行去表六丈，薄地遙望波口南岸，入索北端四丈二寸。以望北岸，入前所望表里一丈二尺。又卻後行去表一十三丈五尺。薄地遙望波口南岸，與南表參合。問波口廣幾何？
術曰：以後去表乘入索，如表相去而一。所得，以前去表減之，餘以為法；復以前去表減後去表，餘以乘入所望表里為實，實如法而一，得波口廣。
答曰： a里 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the width of a river mouth ("波口廣"), represented by the variable `a`. We'll use the given measurements and the described method to compute the result.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
north_south_distance = Fraction(9)  # 南北相去九丈 (9丈)
first_back_distance = Fraction(6)  # 北表之西卻行去表六丈 (6丈)
first_north_rope_in = Fraction(4, 10)  # 入索北端四丈二寸 (4丈2寸 = 4.2丈 = 42/10丈)
first_south_rope_in = Fraction(12, 10)  # 入前所望表里一丈二尺 (1丈2尺 = 1.2丈 = 12/10丈)
second_back_distance = Fraction(135, 10)  # 卻後行去表一十三丈五尺 (13丈5尺 = 13.5丈 = 135/10丈)

# Step 1: Calculate the numerator (實)
numerator = (second_back_distance - first_back_distance) * first_south_rope_in

# Step 2: Calculate the denominator (法)
denominator = (first_back_distance * first_north_rope_in) - (north_south_distance * Fraction(1))

# Step 3: Compute the width of the river mouth (波口廣)
a = numerator / denominator

# Output the result
a

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Given Data**: The measurements provided in the problem are converted into fractions for precise calculations. Units are in "丈" (zhang), with conversions for smaller units like "尺" (chi) and "寸" (cun) as needed.
2. **Numerator Calculation**: The numerator is computed as the product of the difference between the second and first back distances and the first south rope in.
3. **Denominator Calculation**: The denominator is calculated as the product of the first back distance and the first north rope in, minus the north-south distance.
4. **Final Calculation**: The width of the river mouth (`a`) is obtained by dividing the numerator by the denominator.

The result is stored in the variable `a`, which represents the width of the river mouth in "丈".
