今有女子善織，日自倍，五日織五尺。問︰日織幾何？
術曰：置一、二、四、八、十六為列衰，副并為法，以五尺乘未并者，各自為實，實如法得一尺。
荅曰：初日織 a寸 。次日織 b寸 。次日織 c寸 。次日織 d尺 。次日織 e尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem describes a scenario where a woman weaves cloth, doubling her output each day, and after five days, she has woven a total of 5 feet (or 60 inches, since 1 foot = 12 inches). We need to determine how much she weaves each day.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total woven cloth in inches (5 feet = 60 inches)
total_inches = 5 * 12

# The daily weaving amounts are in a geometric progression: 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x
# Their sum is equal to the total woven cloth
# 1x + 2x + 4x + 8x + 16x = total_inches
# 31x = total_inches
x = Fraction(total_inches, 31)

# Calculate the daily weaving amounts
a = x  # First day
b = 2 * x  # Second day
c = 4 * x  # Third day
d = Fraction(8 * x, 12)  # Fourth day (convert to feet)
e = Fraction(16 * x, 12)  # Fifth day (convert to feet)

# The results
a  # First day weaving in inches
b  # Second day weaving in inches
c  # Third day weaving in inches
d  # Fourth day weaving in feet
e  # Fifth day weaving in feet
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. The total woven cloth is converted to inches for easier calculations (5 feet = 60 inches).
2. The daily weaving amounts form a geometric progression: \( x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x \).
3. The sum of these amounts equals the total woven cloth: \( x + 2x + 4x + 8x + 16x = 31x = 60 \) inches.
4. Solve for \( x \): \( x = \frac{60}{31} \) inches.
5. Compute the daily weaving amounts:
   - First day: \( x \)
   - Second day: \( 2x \)
   - Third day: \( 4x \)
   - Fourth day: \( 8x \) (converted to feet: \( \frac{8x}{12} \))
   - Fifth day: \( 16x \) (converted to feet: \( \frac{16x}{12} \))

### Results:
- \( a = \frac{60}{31} \) inches
- \( b = \frac{120}{31} \) inches
- \( c = \frac{240}{31} \) inches
- \( d = \frac{480}{31 \times 12} \) feet
- \( e = \frac{960}{31 \times 12} \) feet
