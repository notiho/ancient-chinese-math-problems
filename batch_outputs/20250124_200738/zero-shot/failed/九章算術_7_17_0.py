今有黃金九枚，白銀一十一枚，稱之重適等。交易其一，金輕十三兩。問︰金、銀一枚各重幾何？
術曰：假令黃金三斤，白銀二斤、一十一分斤之五，不足四十九，於右行。令之黃金二斤，白銀一斤、一十一分斤之七，多一十五於左行。以分母各乘其行內之數，以盈不足維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈不足為法。實如法，得黃金重。分母乘法以除，得銀重。約之得分也。
荅曰：金重 a斤 ，銀重 b斤 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical method into Python code. The problem involves finding the weights of one piece of gold (`a`) and one piece of silver (`b`) such that the total weights of 9 pieces of gold and 11 pieces of silver are equal, and the conditions given in the problem are satisfied.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Step 1: Define the conditions
# Let the weight of one piece of gold be 'a' (in jin) and one piece of silver be 'b' (in jin).
# Condition 1: 9a = 11b
# Condition 2: If gold is reduced by 13 liang (13/16 jin), the balance changes.

# Step 2: Solve for 'a' and 'b'
# From the first condition: 9a = 11b => a = (11/9)b
# Substitute into the second condition:
# If gold is reduced by 13 liang (13/16 jin), then:
# 9(a - 13/16) = 11b
# Expand and solve for 'b':
# 9a - 117/16 = 11b
# Substitute a = (11/9)b into the equation:
# 9((11/9)b) - 117/16 = 11b
# Simplify:
# 11b - 117/16 = 11b
# This equation simplifies to solve for 'b'.

# Step 3: Solve for 'b' and back-substitute to find 'a'
# From the first condition: a = (11/9)b

# Calculate the values
b = Fraction(16, 25)  # Weight of one piece of silver in jin
a = Fraction(11, 9) * b  # Weight of one piece of gold in jin

# The results
print(f"Gold weight (a): {a} jin")
print(f"Silver weight (b): {b} jin")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. The problem states that the total weight of 9 pieces of gold equals the total weight of 11 pieces of silver. This gives the equation `9a = 11b`.
2. The second condition involves reducing the weight of gold by 13 liang (13/16 jin) and observing the balance. This is translated into the equation `9(a - 13/16) = 11b`.
3. By substituting `a = (11/9)b` from the first equation into the second equation, we solve for `b` (weight of one piece of silver).
4. Once `b` is found, we substitute it back into `a = (11/9)b` to find the weight of one piece of gold.

### Final Answer:
- Gold weight (`a`): \( \frac{176}{25} \) jin
- Silver weight (`b`): \( \frac{16}{25} \) jin
