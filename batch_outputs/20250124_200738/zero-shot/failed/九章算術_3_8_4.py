今有甲持粟三升，乙持糲米三升，丙持糲飯三升。欲令合而分之，問︰各幾何？
返衰術曰：列置衰而令相乘，動者為不動者衰。術曰：以粟率五十、糲米率三十、糲飯率七十五為衰、而返衰之，副并為法。以九升乘未并者各自為實。實如法得一升。
荅曰：甲 a升 。乙 b升 。丙 c升 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves distributing 9升 (liters) of a mixture of 粟 (millet), 糲米 (coarse rice), and 糲飯 (coarse cooked rice) among three people (甲, 乙, 丙) based on their respective contributions and rates. The rates are given as follows:

- 粟 rate: 50
- 糲米 rate: 30
- 糲飯 rate: 75

The solution involves using the "返衰術" (inverse proportion method) to calculate the shares for each person.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Rates for 粟, 糲米, and 糲飯
rate_a = 50  # 粟 rate
rate_b = 30  # 糲米 rate
rate_c = 75  # 糲飯 rate

# Contributions in 升
contribution_a = 3  # 粟
contribution_b = 3  # 糲米
contribution_c = 3  # 糲飯

# Calculate the "real value" of each contribution based on rates
real_value_a = contribution_a * rate_a
real_value_b = contribution_b * rate_b
real_value_c = contribution_c * rate_c

# Total "real value"
total_real_value = real_value_a + real_value_b + real_value_c

# Total mixture to be distributed (9升)
total_mixture = 9

# Calculate each person's share using the inverse proportion method
a = Fraction(real_value_a, total_real_value) * total_mixture
b = Fraction(real_value_b, total_real_value) * total_mixture
c = Fraction(real_value_c, total_real_value) * total_mixture

# Results
a, b, c
#----- content ends here -----

### Explanation:
1. **Rates and Contributions**: Each type of grain has a specific rate (value per 升), and each person contributes 3升 of their respective grain.
2. **Real Value**: The real value of each person's contribution is calculated by multiplying their contribution by the rate of their grain.
3. **Total Real Value**: The sum of all real values is used to determine the proportion of the total mixture each person receives.
4. **Inverse Proportion**: Each person's share is calculated as their real value divided by the total real value, multiplied by the total mixture (9升).

### Output:
The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will contain the shares of 甲, 乙, and 丙, respectively, in 升.
