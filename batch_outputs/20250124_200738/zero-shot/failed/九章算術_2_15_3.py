今有粟七斗八升，欲為豉。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求豉，六十三之，五十而一。
荅曰：為豉 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much 豉 (fermented soybean product) can be made from 7斗8升 of 粟 (grain). The rule provided states that for every 63 units of 粟, 50 units of 豉 are produced.

### Step-by-step solution:
1. Convert 7斗8升 into a single unit system. Since 1斗 = 10升, we have:
   \( 7斗8升 = 7 \times 10 + 8 = 78升 \).

2. Use the ratio \( 63 : 50 \) (粟 : 豉) to calculate the amount of 豉. The formula is:
   \[
   \text{豉} = \text{粟} \times \frac{50}{63}
   \]

3. Substitute the value of 粟 (78升) into the formula.

Here is the Python code to compute the value of \( a \) (amount of 豉):


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# 粟 in 升
粟 = 78

# Ratio of 粟 to 豉
ratio = Fraction(50, 63)

# Calculate 豉
a = 粟 * ratio

# a is the amount of 豉 in 升
a
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 豉 in 升 as a `Fraction`.

"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 2457/250, Actual: 1300/21"""
