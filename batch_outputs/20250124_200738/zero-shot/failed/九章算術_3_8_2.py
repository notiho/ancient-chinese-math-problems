今有甲持粟三升，乙持糲米三升，丙持糲飯三升。欲令合而分之，問︰各幾何？
返衰術曰：列置衰而令相乘，動者為不動者衰。術曰：以粟率五十、糲米率三十、糲飯率七十五為衰、而返衰之，副并為法。以九升乘未并者各自為實。實如法得一升。
荅曰：甲 a升 。乙 b升 。丙 c升 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves redistributing three types of grains (粟, 糲米, 糲飯) based on their respective rates (50, 30, 75) and calculating how much each person (甲, 乙, 丙) should receive.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Rates for 粟, 糲米, and 糲飯
rate_a = 50  # 粟 rate
rate_b = 30  # 糲米 rate
rate_c = 75  # 糲飯 rate

# Initial amounts held by 甲, 乙, 丙
amount_a = 3  # 粟 (升)
amount_b = 3  # 糲米 (升)
amount_c = 3  # 糲飯 (升)

# Calculate the total value of all grains
total_value = (amount_a * rate_a) + (amount_b * rate_b) + (amount_c * rate_c)

# Total amount of grains to be redistributed
total_amount = amount_a + amount_b + amount_c

# Calculate the redistributed amount for each person
a = Fraction(total_value, total_amount * rate_a)  # Amount for 甲 in 粟
b = Fraction(total_value, total_amount * rate_b)  # Amount for 乙 in 糲米
c = Fraction(total_value, total_amount * rate_c)  # Amount for 丙 in 糲飯

# Results
a, b, c
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Rates**: The rates for 粟, 糲米, and 糲飯 are given as 50, 30, and 75, respectively.
2. **Initial amounts**: Each person initially holds 3 升 of their respective grain.
3. **Total value**: The total value of all grains is calculated by multiplying the amount of each grain by its rate and summing them up.
4. **Redistribution**: The total amount of grains is redistributed proportionally based on the rates. The formula for each person's share is derived from the "返衰術" method.

### Output:
The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will contain the redistributed amounts for 甲, 乙, and 丙, respectively, in terms of fractions of 升.
