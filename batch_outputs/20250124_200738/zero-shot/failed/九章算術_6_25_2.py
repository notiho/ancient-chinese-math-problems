今有池，五渠注之。其一渠開之，少半日一滿；次，一日一滿；次，二日半一滿；次，三日一滿；次，五日一滿。今皆決之，問︰幾何日滿池？
術曰：各置渠一日滿池之數，并以為法。以一日為實。實如法得一日。
荅曰： a日 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many days it will take for the pool to be filled when all five channels are opened simultaneously. Each channel fills the pool at a different rate. Here's the Python code to compute the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Rates of each channel filling the pool in one day
rate1 = Fraction(2, 1)  # Channel 1 fills the pool in half a day, so rate = 2 pools/day
rate2 = Fraction(1, 1)  # Channel 2 fills the pool in 1 day, so rate = 1 pool/day
rate3 = Fraction(2, 5)  # Channel 3 fills the pool in 2.5 days, so rate = 2/5 pools/day
rate4 = Fraction(1, 3)  # Channel 4 fills the pool in 3 days, so rate = 1/3 pools/day
rate5 = Fraction(1, 5)  # Channel 5 fills the pool in 5 days, so rate = 1/5 pools/day

# Total rate of all channels combined
total_rate = rate1 + rate2 + rate3 + rate4 + rate5

# Time to fill the pool when all channels are open
a = Fraction(1, total_rate)

# The solution is stored in variable 'a'
a
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the number of days it takes to fill the pool when all channels are opened simultaneously.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 15/74, Actual: 15/59"""
