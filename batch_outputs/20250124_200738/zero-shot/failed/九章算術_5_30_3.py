To solve this problem, we need to compute the volume of the pile of grain (菽) and then determine how many "斛" of grain it contains. The problem provides the formula for the volume based on the dimensions of the pile and the conversion rates for different types of grain.

Here is the Python code to compute the values of `a` (volume in cubic 尺) and `b` (amount of grain in 斛):


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given dimensions of the pile
周 = Fraction(3 * 10)  # 周 is 3丈 = 30尺
高 = Fraction(7)  # 高 is 7尺

# Conversion factors
積_per_斛_菽 = Fraction(24, 10)  # 1斛 of 菽 occupies 2尺4寸 = 24/10 尺

# Volume calculation
# 下周自乘，以高乘之，三十六而一
積 = (周 * 周 * 高) / 36

# Amount of grain in 斛
為菽 = 積 / 積_per_斛_菽

# Assigning to variables
a = 積  # Volume in cubic 尺
b = 為菽  # Amount of grain in 斛

# Results
a, b
#----- content ends here -----

### Explanation:
1. **Dimensions**:
   - 周 (周長) is given as 3丈, which is converted to 尺 (1丈 = 10尺). So, 周 = 30尺.
   - 高 (height) is given as 7尺.

2. **Volume formula**:
   - The formula for the volume of the pile is: 下周自乘，以高乘之，三十六而一. This means:
     \[
     \text{Volume} = \frac{\text{周}^2 \times \text{高}}{36}
     \]

3. **Conversion factor**:
   - For 菽, 1斛 occupies a volume of 2尺4寸. Since 1尺 = 10寸, this is equivalent to \( \frac{24}{10} \) cubic 尺.

4. **Amount of grain**:
   - The amount of grain in 斛 is calculated by dividing the total volume by the volume occupied by 1斛 of 菽.

5. **Output**:
   - The results are stored in variables `a` (volume in cubic 尺) and `b` (amount of grain in 斛).

### Final Results:
- `a` is the total volume in cubic 尺.
- `b` is the total amount of grain in 斛.
