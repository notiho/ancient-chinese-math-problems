To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of items of two types (let's call them `a` and `c`) and their respective prices (`b` and `d`) such that the total number of items is 78 and the total cost is 576. The problem implies that the prices of the two types of items are different, and we need to find their distribution.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total number of items and total cost
total_items = 78
total_cost = 576

# Let the price of the first type of item be b and the price of the second type of item be d.
# Assume b < d (as stated in the problem: "法賤實貴").
# Let the number of the first type of item be a and the number of the second type of item be c.

# We know:
# a + c = total_items
# a * b + c * d = total_cost

# To solve, assume b = 5 and d = 8 (as an example of two different prices).
b = 5
d = 8

# Solve for a and c:
# a + c = total_items
# a * b + c * d = total_cost

# From the first equation, c = total_items - a
# Substitute into the second equation:
# a * b + (total_items - a) * d = total_cost
# a * b + total_items * d - a * d = total_cost
# a * (b - d) = total_cost - total_items * d
# a = (total_cost - total_items * d) / (b - d)

a = Fraction(total_cost - total_items * d, b - d)
c = total_items - a

# Verify the solution:
# b and d are already given, so no need to calculate them further.

# Output the results:
a = int(a)  # Number of the first type of item
b = int(b)  # Price of the first type of item
c = int(c)  # Number of the second type of item
d = int(d)  # Price of the second type of item

# The results are stored in variables a, b, c, and d.

### Explanation:
1. The total number of items is 78, and the total cost is 576.
2. Assume the prices of the two types of items are `b` and `d`, where `b < d`.
3. Use the equations:
   - `a + c = total_items`
   - `a * b + c * d = total_cost`
4. Solve for `a` and `c` using substitution and basic algebra.
5. Assign the results to variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

### Note:
You can adjust the values of `b` and `d` to match the specific prices if they are provided or inferred from the problem.
