今有女子善織，日自倍，五日織五尺。問︰日織幾何？
術曰：置一、二、四、八、十六為列衰，副并為法，以五尺乘未并者，各自為實，實如法得一尺。
荅曰：初日織 a寸 。次日織 b寸 。次日織 c寸 。次日織 d尺 。次日織 e尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem describes a situation where a woman weaves cloth, doubling her output each day, and in five days she weaves a total of 5 feet. We need to calculate how much she weaves each day.

Here is the Python code to compute the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total woven in 5 days is 5 feet, which is 60 inches (1 foot = 12 inches).
total_inches = 5 * 12

# The daily weaving doubles each day: a, 2a, 4a, 8a, 16a.
# Total woven: a + 2a + 4a + 8a + 16a = 31a.
# Solve for a: 31a = total_inches.
a = Fraction(total_inches, 31)

# Calculate the weaving for each day.
b = 2 * a
c = 4 * a
d = 8 * a
e = 16 * a

# The results are in inches. Convert to feet where necessary.
# a, b, and c remain in inches.
# d and e are converted to feet.
d = d / 12
e = e / 12

# The results are:
# a: inches woven on the first day
# b: inches woven on the second day
# c: inches woven on the third day
# d: feet woven on the fourth day
# e: feet woven on the fifth day
#----- content ends here -----


"""


This code calculates the amount woven each day, with the results stored in the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`. The units are inches for `a`, `b`, and `c`, and feet for `d` and `e`.
