今有粟一十斗八升、五分升之二，欲為麥。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求菽、答、麻、麥，皆九之，十而一。
荅曰：為麥 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we will use the given rule: "以粟求菽、答、麻、麥，皆九之，十而一." This means that to convert 粟 (millet) to 麥 (wheat), we multiply the amount of 粟 by 9/10.

The given amount of 粟 is 10斗8升 and 5分升之2. We will first convert this to a single unit (斗), then apply the conversion rule to find the amount of 麥.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Convert the given 粟 amount to a single unit (斗)
# 1斗 = 10升, 1升 = 10分升
粟 = Fraction(10) + Fraction(8, 10) + Fraction(2, 10 * 10)

# Conversion rule: multiply 粟 by 9/10 to get 麥
a = 粟 * Fraction(9, 10)

# The result is stored in variable 'a'
#----- content ends here -----


"""


After running this code, the variable `a` will contain the amount of 麥 in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 2439/250, Actual: 4869/500"""
