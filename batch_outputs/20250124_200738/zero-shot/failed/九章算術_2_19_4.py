今有糲米十五斗五升、五分升之二，欲為粟。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以糲米求粟，五之，三而一。
荅曰：為粟 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of 粟 (a) that can be obtained from 糲米. The problem states that the conversion rule is: "以糲米求粟，五之，三而一," which means multiply the amount of 糲米 by 5 and then divide by 3.

The given amount of 糲米 is 15斗5升2/5升. We will first convert this to a single unit (斗), then apply the conversion rule.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given 糲米 in 斗, 升, and 分升
liangmi_dou = 15
liangmi_sheng = 5
liangmi_fensheng = Fraction(2, 5)

# Convert everything to 斗 (1斗 = 10升, 1升 = 10分升)
liangmi_total = liangmi_dou + Fraction(liangmi_sheng, 10) + Fraction(liangmi_fensheng, 100)

# Conversion rule: multiply by 5 and divide by 3
a = liangmi_total * 5 / 3

# The result is stored in variable 'a'
a
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 粟 in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 259/10, Actual: 646/25"""
