今有蒲生一日，長三尺。莞生一日，長一尺。蒲生日自半。莞生日自倍。問︰幾何日而長等？
術曰：假令二日，不足一尺五寸。令之三日，有餘一尺七寸半。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰： a日 。各長 b尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the number of days (`a`) it takes for two plants, "蒲" and "莞," to grow to the same length, given their daily growth rates and initial conditions. We will also compute the length (`b`) of each plant when they are equal.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Growth rates and initial conditions
daily_growth_pu = Fraction(3, 1)  # 蒲 grows 3尺 per day
daily_growth_guan = Fraction(1, 1)  # 莞 grows 1尺 per day
initial_length_pu = Fraction(1, 2)  # 蒲 starts at half its daily growth
initial_length_guan = Fraction(2, 1)  # 莞 starts at double its daily growth

# Using the 盈不足術 (Excess and Deficit Method)
# After 2 days, the difference in lengths is:
difference_2_days = (2 * daily_growth_pu + initial_length_pu) - (2 * daily_growth_guan + initial_length_guan)
# After 3 days, the difference in lengths is:
difference_3_days = (3 * daily_growth_pu + initial_length_pu) - (3 * daily_growth_guan + initial_length_guan)

# Excess and deficit values
excess = abs(difference_3_days)  # 1尺7寸半 = 1尺 + 7/10尺 = 17/10尺
deficit = abs(difference_2_days)  # 1尺5寸 = 1尺 + 5/10尺 = 15/10尺

# Calculate the number of days (a) using the formula:
# a = (excess * 2) / (excess + deficit)
a = (excess * 2) / (excess + deficit)

# Calculate the length (b) when the lengths are equal:
b = a * daily_growth_pu + initial_length_pu

# Results
a = float(a)  # Convert to a float for readability
b = float(b)  # Convert to a float for readability

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Growth Rates and Initial Conditions**:
   - 蒲 grows 3尺 per day and starts at half its daily growth (1.5尺).
   - 莞 grows 1尺 per day and starts at double its daily growth (2尺).

2. **盈不足術 (Excess and Deficit Method)**:
   - After 2 days, the difference in lengths is calculated.
   - After 3 days, the difference in lengths is calculated.
   - The excess and deficit values are derived from these differences.

3. **Formula for Number of Days (a)**:
   - Using the formula from the method, the number of days is calculated as:
     \[
     a = \frac{\text{excess} \times 2}{\text{excess} + \text{deficit}}
     \]

4. **Length When Equal (b)**:
   - The length of each plant when they are equal is calculated using the growth rate and initial length of 蒲.

### Final Answer:
- `a`: Number of days it takes for the plants to be of equal length.
- `b`: Length of each plant when they are equal.
