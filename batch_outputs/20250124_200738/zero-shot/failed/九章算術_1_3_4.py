又有田廣二里，從三里。問：為田幾何？
里田術曰：廣從里數相乘得積里。以三百七十五乘之，即畝數。
荅曰： a頃 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of a rectangular field given its width ("廣") and length ("從") in "里" (a traditional Chinese unit of length). The area is then converted into "畝" (a traditional Chinese unit of area). 

The problem states:
- Width ("廣") = 2 里
- Length ("從") = 3 里
- Conversion factor: 375 畝 = 1 里²

The area in "里²" is calculated by multiplying the width and the length. Then, we multiply the result by 375 to convert it into "畝".

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
width = Fraction(2)  # 2 里
length = Fraction(3)  # 3 里
conversion_factor = Fraction(375)  # 375 畝 per 里²

# Calculate the area in 里²
area_in_li_squared = width * length

# Convert the area to 畝
a = area_in_li_squared * conversion_factor

# The result is stored in variable 'a'
#----- content ends here -----


"""


After running this code, the variable `a` will contain the area of the field in 畝.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 45/2, Actual: 2250"""
