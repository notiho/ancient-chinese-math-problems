今有木，方三尺，高三尺，欲方五寸作枕一枚。問：得幾何？
術曰：置方三尺，自相乘，得九尺，以高三尺乘之，得二十七尺，以一尺木八枕乘之，即得。

This problem involves calculating how many wooden pillows (each with a square cross-section of 5 inches by 5 inches and a height of 1 foot) can be made from a wooden block with dimensions 3 feet by 3 feet by 3 feet.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Dimensions of the wooden block
block_side = 3  # in feet
block_height = 3  # in feet

# Dimensions of one pillow
pillow_side = Fraction(5, 12)  # 5 inches converted to feet
pillow_height = 1  # in feet

# Volume of the wooden block
block_volume = block_side * block_side * block_height  # in cubic feet

# Volume of one pillow
pillow_volume = pillow_side * pillow_side * pillow_height  # in cubic feet

# Number of pillows that can be made
a = block_volume // pillow_volume  # Integer division to get the count of whole pillows

# Result
a  # Number of pillows
#----- content ends here -----


"""


This code calculates the number of pillows (`a`) that can be made. The result is stored in the variable `a`.

"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 216, Actual: 155"""
