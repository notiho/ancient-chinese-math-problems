今有共買物，人出八，盈三；人出七，不足四。問︰人數、物價各幾何？
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰： a人 ，物價 b 。

This is a classic problem involving surplus and deficit. Let's translate the problem into Python code and compute the values of the unknowns `a` (number of people) and `b` (price of the item). We'll use the method described in the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. When each person contributes 8 units, there is a surplus of 3 units.
2. When each person contributes 7 units, there is a deficit of 4 units.
3. We need to find the number of people (`a`) and the price of the item (`b`).

### Python Code:

"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
rate1 = 8  # Contribution rate when there is a surplus
surplus = 3  # Surplus amount
rate2 = 7  # Contribution rate when there is a deficit
deficit = 4  # Deficit amount

# Step 1: Compute the "實" (numerator)
numerator = rate1 * rate2

# Step 2: Compute the "法" (denominator)
denominator = surplus + deficit

# Step 3: Compute the number of people (a)
a = Fraction(numerator, denominator)

# Step 4: Compute the price of the item (b)
b = Fraction(rate1 * a - surplus)

# Results
a, b
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Numerator (`實`)**: Multiply the two contribution rates (`rate1` and `rate2`).
2. **Denominator (`法`)**: Add the surplus and deficit.
3. **Number of People (`a`)**: Divide the numerator by the denominator.
4. **Price of the Item (`b`)**: Use the formula `b = rate1 * a - surplus` to compute the price.

### Output:
The variables `a` and `b` will hold the number of people and the price of the item, respectively.
