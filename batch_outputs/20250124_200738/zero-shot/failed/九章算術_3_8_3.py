今有甲持粟三升，乙持糲米三升，丙持糲飯三升。欲令合而分之，問︰各幾何？
返衰術曰：列置衰而令相乘，動者為不動者衰。術曰：以粟率五十、糲米率三十、糲飯率七十五為衰、而返衰之，副并為法。以九升乘未并者各自為實。實如法得一升。
荅曰：甲 a升 。乙 b升 。丙 c升 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves dividing 9升 (liters) of mixed grains and food among three people (甲, 乙, 丙) based on their respective contributions and rates.

The rates are:
- 粟 (millet): 50
- 糲米 (coarse rice): 30
- 糲飯 (coarse cooked rice): 75

The contributions are:
- 甲持粟三升 (甲 contributes 3升 of millet)
- 乙持糲米三升 (乙 contributes 3升 of coarse rice)
- 丙持糲飯三升 (丙 contributes 3升 of coarse cooked rice)

The solution involves calculating the "weighted contributions" based on the rates, summing them up, and then dividing the total amount (9升) proportionally.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Rates
rate_millet = 50
rate_coarse_rice = 30
rate_coarse_cooked_rice = 75

# Contributions
contribution_millet = 3
contribution_coarse_rice = 3
contribution_coarse_cooked_rice = 3

# Weighted contributions
weighted_millet = rate_millet * contribution_millet
weighted_coarse_rice = rate_coarse_rice * contribution_coarse_rice
weighted_coarse_cooked_rice = rate_coarse_cooked_rice * contribution_coarse_cooked_rice

# Total weighted contribution
total_weighted = weighted_millet + weighted_coarse_rice + weighted_coarse_cooked_rice

# Total amount to be divided
total_amount = 9

# Proportional shares
a = Fraction(weighted_millet, total_weighted) * total_amount
b = Fraction(weighted_coarse_rice, total_weighted) * total_amount
c = Fraction(weighted_coarse_cooked_rice, total_weighted) * total_amount

# Results
a, b, c
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. We calculate the weighted contributions for each type of grain/food by multiplying the rate by the contribution.
2. We sum up the weighted contributions to get the total weighted contribution.
3. We divide the total amount (9升) proportionally based on the weighted contributions.
4. The results are stored in variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Output:
The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will contain the respective shares of 甲, 乙, and 丙 in fractions of 升.
