今有與人絲一十四斤，約得縑一十斤。今與人絲四十五斤八兩，問︰得縑幾何？
術曰：以一十四斤兩數為法，以一十斤乘今有絲兩數為實，實如法得縑數。
荅曰： a斤 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves proportional reasoning to determine how much silk fabric ("縑") can be obtained from a given amount of raw silk ("絲"). Here's the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
silk_1 = Fraction(14)  # 14斤 (raw silk in the first case)
fabric_1 = Fraction(10)  # 10斤 (fabric obtained in the first case)
silk_2 = Fraction(45, 2)  # 45斤8兩 = 45.5斤 (raw silk in the second case)

# Proportional calculation
a = fabric_1 * silk_2 / silk_1  # Compute the amount of fabric obtained

# Result
a  # a is the amount of fabric in 斤
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the result in `斤` (a traditional Chinese unit of weight).
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 65/2, Actual: 225/14"""
