"""
今有粟一斗，欲為小䵂。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求小䵂，二十七之，百而一。
荅曰：為小䵂 a升 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many "升" (a unit of volume) of "小䵂" can be made from 1斗 of 粟 (grain). The problem states that the conversion rate is 27:100, meaning 27 units of 粟 can produce 100 units of 小䵂.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Conversion rate: 27 粟 -> 100 小䵂
粟 = 1  # 1 斗 of 粟
a = Fraction(粟 * 100, 27)  # Calculate 小䵂 in 升

# The result is stored in variable 'a'
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The value of `a` will represent the amount of 小䵂 in 升.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 27/10, Actual: 100/27"""
