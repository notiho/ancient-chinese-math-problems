今有糲飯七斗六升、七分升之四，欲為飧。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以糲飯求飧，六之，五而一。
荅曰：為飧 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to compute the amount of "飧" (a type of food) that can be made from the given amount of "糲飯" (coarse rice). The rule provided states: "以糲飯求飧，六之，五而一," which means for every 6 parts of 糲飯, 5 parts of 飧 can be made.

The given amount of 糲飯 is 7斗6升 and 7分升之4. In terms of a single unit (斗), we need to convert everything to fractions of a 斗.

1斗 = 10升  
1升 = 10分升  

Thus, the total amount of 糲飯 is:  
7斗 + 6升 + 4/7分升  
= 7斗 + 6/10斗 + 4/(7*10*10)斗  
= 7 + 6/10 + 4/700斗.

Now, we apply the rule: for every 6 parts of 糲飯, 5 parts of 飧 can be made. This means we multiply the total 糲飯 by 5/6 to get the amount of 飧.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given 糲飯
糲飯 = Fraction(7, 1) + Fraction(6, 10) + Fraction(4, 700)

# Rule: 6 parts of 糲飯 make 5 parts of 飧
a = 糲飯 * Fraction(5, 6)

# Output the result
a  # The amount of 飧 in 斗
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 飧 in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 1608/175, Actual: 1331/210"""
