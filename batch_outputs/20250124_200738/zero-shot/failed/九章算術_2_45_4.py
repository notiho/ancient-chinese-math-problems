今有出錢九百八十，買矢簳五千八百二十枚。欲其貴賤率之，問︰各幾何？
反其率術曰：以錢數為法，所率為實，實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法少，實多。二物各以所得多少之數乘法實，即物數。
荅曰：其 a枚 ， b枚 一錢 其 c枚 ， d枚 一錢

"""
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of arrows (矢簳) that can be bought at different rates (貴賤). The problem implies that there are two rates: one rate where "a枚" costs "b枚" per unit of money, and another rate where "c枚" costs "d枚" per unit of money. The total money spent is 980, and the total number of arrows purchased is 5820.

We will translate this into Python code to compute the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

# Total money spent
total_money = 980

# Total number of arrows purchased
total_arrows = 5820

# Let the two rates be:
# a枚 per b枚 of money
# c枚 per d枚 of money

# Assume the first rate is 1枚 per 2 units of money

# This means:
b = 2
a = 1
d = 4
c = 3

# Compute the number of arrows purchased at each rate
# Let x be the amount of money spent at the first rate
