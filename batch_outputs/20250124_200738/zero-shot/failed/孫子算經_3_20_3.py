今有地，長一千步，廣五百步，尺有鶉、寸有鷃。問鶉、鷃各幾何？
術曰：置長一千步，以廣五百步乘之，得五十萬；以三十六乘之，得一千八百萬尺，即得鶉數；上十之，即得鷃數。
答曰：鶉 a ，鷃 b 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will compute the values of "a" (鶉) and "b" (鷃) as described in the problem. Here's the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
length = 1000  # in steps
width = 500  # in steps
conversion_factor = 36  # 1 step = 36 feet

# Calculate the area in steps
area_steps = length * width  # in square steps

# Convert the area to square feet
a = area_steps * conversion_factor  # 鶉 (a) in square feet

# Convert 鶉 to 鷃
b = a * 10  # 鷃 (b) in square inches

# Results
a  # 鶉
b  # 鷃
