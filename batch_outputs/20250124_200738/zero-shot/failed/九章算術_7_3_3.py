今有共買牛，七家共出一百九十，不足三百三十；九家共出二百七十，盈三十。問︰家數、牛價各幾何？
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰： a家 ，牛價 b 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the number of families (`a`) and the price of a cow (`b`) based on the given conditions.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given conditions:
# 7 families contribute 190, which is 330 short.
# 9 families contribute 270, which is 30 extra.

# Step 1: Define the rates and the excess/deficit.
rate1 = 190  # Amount contributed by 7 families
rate2 = 270  # Amount contributed by 9 families
deficit = 330 - 190  # Deficit for 7 families
excess = 270 - 300  # Excess for 9 families

# Step 2: Compute the total "real" value (price of cows) and the number of families.
# Using the method described in the problem:
# Multiply the rates by their respective family counts and sum them.
real_value_numerator = (rate1 * 9) + (rate2 * 7)
real_value_denominator = deficit + excess

# The price of a cow (b):
b = Fraction(real_value_numerator, real_value_denominator)

# The number of families (a):
a = Fraction(b, rate1) * 7

# Results:
a = a.numerator  # Number of families must be an integer
b = b  # Price of a cow as a fraction

# Output the results:
print("Number of families (a):", a)
print("Price of a cow (b):", b)
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Rates and Excess/Deficit**:
   - For 7 families, the total contribution is 190, which is 330 short of the required amount.
   - For 9 families, the total contribution is 270, which is 30 more than the required amount.

2. **Real Value Calculation**:
   - Multiply the rates by their respective family counts and sum them.
   - Divide this sum by the total of the deficit and excess to find the real value (price of a cow).

3. **Number of Families**:
   - Use the price of a cow to calculate the number of families.

### Output:
The code will compute and print the number of families (`a`) and the price of a cow (`b`).
