To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the volume of a granary after accounting for the space occupied by certain objects (beams, crossbeams, and a pillar). The final answer is expressed in terms of "斛" (a unit of volume) and remaining "寸" (a smaller unit of volume).

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Dimensions of the granary
length = Fraction(1, 1) * 130  # 1丈3尺 = 130寸
width = Fraction(1, 1) * 60    # 6尺 = 60寸
height = Fraction(1, 1) * 100  # 1丈 = 100寸

# Total volume of the granary
total_volume = length * width * height  # 都積

# Volume occupied by the two longitudinal beams (牽)
beam_length = Fraction(1, 1) * 130  # Length of the beam
beam_cross_section = Fraction(5, 1) ** 2  # 5寸 x 5寸 = 25寸²
beam_volume = beam_length * beam_cross_section * 2  # Two beams

# Volume occupied by the three transverse beams (横牽)
crossbeam_width = Fraction(1, 1) * 60  # Width of the crossbeam
crossbeam_cross_section = Fraction(4, 1) ** 2  # 4寸 x 4寸 = 16寸²
crossbeam_volume = crossbeam_width * crossbeam_cross_section * 3  # Three crossbeams

# Volume occupied by the pillar (柱)
pillar_circumference = Fraction(3, 1) * 10  # 3尺 = 30寸 circumference
pillar_radius = pillar_circumference / (2 * Fraction(22, 7))  # Using π ≈ 22/7
pillar_cross_section = Fraction(22, 7) * pillar_radius ** 2  # πr²
pillar_height = Fraction(1, 1) * 100  # 1丈 = 100寸
pillar_volume = pillar_cross_section * pillar_height
pillar_volume = pillar_volume / 12  # Adjust for the pillar's shape (cylinder)

# Total volume occupied by the beams and pillar
occupied_volume = beam_volume + crossbeam_volume + pillar_volume

# Remaining volume in the granary
remaining_volume = total_volume - occupied_volume

# Convert the remaining volume into "斛" and "寸"
volume_per_hu = Fraction(1620, 1)  # 1斛 = 1620寸³
a = remaining_volume // volume_per_hu  # Number of 斛
b = remaining_volume % volume_per_hu  # Remaining volume in 寸³

# Results
a = int(a)
b = int(b)

# Output the results
print(f"a = {a} 斛")
print(f"b = {b} 寸")

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Granary Dimensions**: The granary's dimensions are converted into "寸" (smallest unit of length in the problem).
2. **Total Volume**: The total volume of the granary is calculated as `length * width * height`.
3. **Occupied Volume**:
   - For the longitudinal beams, the cross-sectional area is calculated and multiplied by the length and the number of beams.
   - For the transverse beams, the cross-sectional area is calculated and multiplied by the width and the number of beams.
   - For the pillar, the cross-sectional area is calculated using the formula for the area of a circle (`πr²`), and then multiplied by the height. The result is divided by 12 to account for the cylindrical shape.
4. **Remaining Volume**: The occupied volume is subtracted from the total volume.
5. **Conversion to "斛" and "寸"**: The remaining volume is divided by 1620寸³ (1斛) to determine the number of "斛" and the leftover "寸".
6. **Output**: The results are printed as `a` (斛) and `b` (寸).
