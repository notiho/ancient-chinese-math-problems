又有積一萬六千四百四十八億六千六百四十三萬七千五百尺。問︰為立圓徑幾何？
開立圓術曰：置積尺數，以十六乘之，九而一，所得開立方除之，即丸徑。
荅曰： a尺 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will follow the method described in the text. The problem involves finding the diameter of a sphere (丸徑) given its volume. The formula provided in the text is:

1. Multiply the volume by 16.
2. Divide the result by 9.
3. Take the cube root of the result.
4. The result is the diameter of the sphere.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given volume in cubic 尺
volume = 1644866437500  # in cubic 尺

# Step 1: Multiply the volume by 16
step1 = volume * 16

# Step 2: Divide the result by 9
step2 = Fraction(step1, 9)

# Step 3: Take the cube root of the result
a = step2 ** Fraction(1, 3)

# The diameter of the sphere is stored in variable 'a'
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the diameter of the sphere in 尺.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 14300, Actual: 14299.999999999993"""
