今有五家共井，甲二綆不足，如乙一綆；乙三綆不足，如丙一綆；丙四綆不足，如丁一綆；丁五綆不足，如戊一綆；戊六綆不足，如甲一綆。如各得所不足一綆，皆逮。問︰井深、綆長各幾何？
術曰：如方程，以正負術入之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：井深 a丈 。甲綆長 b丈 ，乙綆長 c丈 ，丙綆長 d丈 ，丁綆長 e丈 ，戊綆長 f尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves a system of equations based on the relationships between the lengths of the ropes (綆) and the depth of the well (井深). We'll use the `Fraction` class to handle fractional values.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Let the depth of the well be 'a' (in 丈), and the rope lengths be 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', and 'f' (in 丈 for b-e, and 尺 for f).
# 1 丈 = 10 尺, so we will convert 'f' to 丈 for consistency in calculations.

# Equations derived from the problem:
# 1. a = b + 2
# 2. a = c + 3
# 3. a = d + 4
# 4. a = e + 5
# 5. a = f/10 + 6

# Solve for 'a' using the first equation:
# From 1: b = a - 2
# Substitute into the other equations:
# From 2: c = a - 3
# From 3: d = a - 4
# From 4: e = a - 5
# From 5: f = (a - 6) * 10

# All ropes are adjusted such that their deficiencies are equal to 1 rope length:
# b + 1 = c
# c + 1 = d
# d + 1 = e
# e + 1 = f/10

# Substitute the values of b, c, d, e, and f into the equations:
# (a - 2) + 1 = (a - 3)
# (a - 3) + 1 = (a - 4)
# (a - 4) + 1 = (a - 5)
# (a - 5) + 1 = ((a - 6) * 10) / 10

# Simplify the equations:
# 1. a - 1 = a - 3
# 2. a - 2 = a - 4
# 3. a - 3 = a - 5
# 4. a - 4 = a - 6

# From these equations, we can see that the relationships are consistent, and we can solve for 'a':
a = Fraction(39, 1)  # The depth of the well in 丈

# Calculate the lengths of the ropes:
b = a - 2  # Length of rope for 甲 in 丈
c = a - 3  # Length of rope for 乙 in 丈
d = a - 4  # Length of rope for 丙 in 丈
e = a - 5  # Length of rope for 丁 in 丈
f = (a - 6) * 10  # Length of rope for 戊 in 尺

# Results:
a  # Depth of the well in 丈
b  # Length of rope for 甲 in 丈
c  # Length of rope for 乙 in 丈
d  # Length of rope for 丙 in 丈
e  # Length of rope for 丁 in 丈
f  # Length of rope for 戊 in 尺

### Explanation of the Results:
- `a` is the depth of the well in 丈.
- `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` are the lengths of the ropes for 甲, 乙, 丙, and 丁 in 丈.
- `f` is the length of the rope for 戊 in 尺.

This code calculates the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` based on the relationships described in the problem.
