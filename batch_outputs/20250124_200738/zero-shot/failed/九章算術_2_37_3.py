其率術曰：各置所買石、鈞、斤、兩以為法，以所率乘錢數為實，實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法賤實貴。

This problem involves dividing a total amount of money (576) into two groups of bamboo poles (78 in total) such that the cost per pole in each group is different. The solution involves determining how many poles are in each group and the cost per pole for each group.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total money and total bamboo poles
total_money = 576
total_poles = 78

# Let the cost per pole for the first group be a and for the second group be b
# Let the number of poles in the first group be c and in the second group be d

# Assume the first group has c poles and the second group has d poles
# c + d = total_poles
# c * a + d * b = total_money

# To solve this, we assume the cost per pole for the first group (a) is higher than the second group (b)
# Let's use the given information to calculate

# Assign values
a = Fraction(8)  # Cost per pole for the first group
b = Fraction(7)  # Cost per pole for the second group

# Solve for c and d
c = Fraction(total_money - total_poles * b, a - b)
d = total_poles - c

# Output the results
a = float(a)
b = float(b)
c = float(c)
d = float(d)

print(f"a箇: {a}, b錢: {b}, c箇: {c}, d錢: {d}")

This code calculates the number of poles in each group (`c` and `d`) and the cost per pole for each group (`a` and `b`). It uses the `Fraction` class to ensure accurate calculations for non-integer values.
