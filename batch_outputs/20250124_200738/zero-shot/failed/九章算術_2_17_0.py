今有粟四斗，欲為熟菽。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求熟菽，二百七之，百而一。
荅曰：為熟菽 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of 熟菽 (cooked beans) that can be obtained from 4 斗 of 粟 (grain). The rule provided states that for every 100 units of 粟, 1 unit of 熟菽 is obtained. This is equivalent to multiplying the amount of 粟 by \( \frac{1}{100} \).

Here is the Python code to compute the value of \( a \):


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
粟 = 4  # in 斗

# Calculation
a = 粟 * Fraction(1, 100)

# Result
a  # in 斗
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The value of \( a \) will be the amount of 熟菽 in 斗.

"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 207/25, Actual: 1/25"""
