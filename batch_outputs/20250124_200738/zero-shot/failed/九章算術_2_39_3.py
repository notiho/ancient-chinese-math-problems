今有出錢一萬三千九百七十，買絲一石二鈞二十八斤三兩五銖。欲其貴賤石率之，問︰各幾何？
其率術曰：各置所買石、鈞、斤、兩以為法，以所率乘錢數為實，實如法而一。不滿法者反以實減法，法賤實貴。
荅曰：其 a鈞 ，石 b錢 。其 c石 ，石 d錢 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the price rate per unit (石, 鈞, etc.) for a given amount of money and weight of silk. The solution involves dividing the total money by the total weight in each unit.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_money = 13970  # in 錢
total_weight_stone = 1  # 石
total_weight_jun = 2  # 鈞
total_weight_jin = 28  # 斤
total_weight_liang = 3  # 兩
total_weight_zhu = 5  # 銖

# Conversion factors
jin_per_jun = 30  # 1 鈞 = 30 斤
liang_per_jin = 16  # 1 斤 = 16 兩
zhu_per_liang = 24  # 1 兩 = 24 銖

# Convert total weight to 銖 (smallest unit)
total_weight_in_zhu = (
    total_weight_stone * jin_per_jun * liang_per_jin * zhu_per_liang +
    total_weight_jun * jin_per_jun * liang_per_jin * zhu_per_liang +
    total_weight_jin * liang_per_jin * zhu_per_liang +
    total_weight_liang * zhu_per_liang +
    total_weight_zhu
)

# Calculate rates
rate_per_stone = Fraction(total_money, total_weight_stone)  # 錢 per 石
rate_per_jun = Fraction(total_money, total_weight_jun + total_weight_stone * jin_per_jun)  # 錢 per 鈞

# Assign rates to variables
a = rate_per_jun  # 鈞 rate
b = rate_per_stone  # 石 rate
c = total_weight_stone  # 石
d = rate_per_stone  # 石 rate

# Output results
a, b, c, d
