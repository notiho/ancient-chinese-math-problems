今有女子善織，日自倍，五日織通五尺。問：日織幾何？
術曰：各置列衰副，并得三十一為法，以五尺乘并者，各自為實，實如法而一，即得。
答曰：初日織 a寸 ，次日織 b寸 ，次日織 c寸 ，次日織 d尺 ，次日織 e尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem describes a scenario where a woman weaves cloth, doubling her output each day, and after five days, she has woven a total of 5 feet (or 60 inches, since 1 foot = 12 inches). We need to determine how much she weaves each day.

The solution involves setting up the daily weaving amounts as \( a, b, c, d, e \), where each day doubles the previous day's output. The total is given as 60 inches. Using the method described, we compute the values for \( a, b, c, d, e \).

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total woven in 5 days is 5 feet = 60 inches
total_inches = 60

# The daily weaving amounts are in a geometric progression: a, 2a, 4a, 8a, 16a
# Their sum is: a + 2a + 4a + 8a + 16a = 31a
# This sum equals 60 inches
a = Fraction(total_inches, 31)  # First day's weaving in inches

# Compute the weaving amounts for each day
b = 2 * a  # Second day
c = 4 * a  # Third day
d = 8 * a  # Fourth day
e = 16 * a  # Fifth day

# Results
a, b, c, d, e
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. The total woven in 5 days is given as 5 feet, which we convert to inches (60 inches).
2. The daily weaving amounts form a geometric progression: \( a, 2a, 4a, 8a, 16a \).
3. The sum of these amounts is \( 31a \), and this equals 60 inches. Solving for \( a \), we find \( a = \frac{60}{31} \).
4. Using \( a \), we calculate \( b, c, d, e \) by doubling the previous day's amount.

### Output:
The variables \( a, b, c, d, e \) will hold the amounts woven each day in inches.
