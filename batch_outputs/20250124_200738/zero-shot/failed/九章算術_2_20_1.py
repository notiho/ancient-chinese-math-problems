今有粺米二斗，欲為粟。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粺米求粟，五十之，二十七而一。
荅曰：為粟 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to convert 粺米 (refined rice) into 粟 (unrefined rice). The rule provided states that for every 50 units of refined rice, we get 27 units of unrefined rice.

Here is the Python code to compute the value of `a`:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
粺米 = Fraction(2)  # 粺米 in 斗
conversion_ratio = Fraction(27, 50)  # 27/50 is the conversion ratio from 粺米 to 粟

# Compute the amount of 粟
a = 粺米 * conversion_ratio

# Result
a  # a is the amount of 粟 in 斗
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The value of `a` will represent the amount of 粟 in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 100/27, Actual: 27/25"""
