又有圭田廣五步、二分步之一，從八步、三分步之二。問：為田幾何？
術曰：半廣以乘正從。
荅曰： a步 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of a field (田) given its dimensions. The width (廣) is \(5 + \frac{1}{2}\) steps (步), and the length (正) is \(8 + \frac{2}{3}\) steps (步). The formula for the area is:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length}
\]

Here is the Python code to compute the area:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Dimensions of the field
width = 5 + Fraction(1, 2)  # 5 + 1/2 steps
length = 8 + Fraction(2, 3)  # 8 + 2/3 steps

# Calculate the area
a = width * length  # Area in steps^2

# The result is stored in variable 'a'
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The area \(a\) is the solution in steps squared (步²).
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 143/6, Actual: 143/3"""
