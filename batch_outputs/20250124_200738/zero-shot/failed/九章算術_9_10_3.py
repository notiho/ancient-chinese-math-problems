今有戶高多於廣六尺八寸，兩隅相去適一丈。問︰戶高、廣各幾何？
術曰：令一丈自乘為實。半相多，令自乘，倍之，減實，半其餘。以開方除之，所得，減相多之半，即戶廣。加相多之半，即戶高。
荅曰：廣 a尺 ；高 b尺 。

To solve this problem, let's translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. We'll use the `Fraction` class to ensure precise calculations for numbers that might not be integers.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
相多 = Fraction(6, 1) + Fraction(8, 10)  # 6尺8寸 = 6 + 8/10 尺
兩隅相去 = Fraction(10, 1)  # 1丈 = 10尺

# Step 1: Let 1丈自乘為實
實 = 兩隅相去 ** 2

# Step 2: Half of 相多
半相多 = 相多 / 2

# Step 3: Let 半相多自乘, then double it
倍半相多自乘 = 2 * (半相多 ** 2)

# Step 4: Subtract 實 from 倍半相多自乘
餘 = 倍半相多自乘 - 實

# Step 5: Half the remainder 餘
半餘 = 餘 / 2

# Step 6: Take the square root of 半餘 (開方)
開方 = 半餘 ** Fraction(1, 2)

# Step 7: Divide 開方 by 半相多
戶廣 = 開方 - 半相多

# Step 8: Add 半相多 to 戶廣 to get 戶高
戶高 = 戶廣 + 相多

# Assign the results to variables a and b
a = 戶廣
b = 戶高

# Output the results
a, b

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **相多** is the difference between the height and width of the door, given as 6尺8寸 (6 + 8/10 尺).
2. **兩隅相去** is the diagonal of the door, given as 1丈 (10尺).
3. The algorithm follows the steps described in the problem:
   - Compute the square of the diagonal (實).
   - Work with half of 相多 (半相多) and its square.
   - Subtract 實 from twice the square of 半相多, then halve the result (餘).
   - Take the square root of 半餘 and adjust it by 半相多 to find the width (戶廣).
   - Add 半相多 to 戶廣 to find the height (戶高).
4. The results are stored in variables `a` (width) and `b` (height).

### Output:
The variables `a` and `b` will contain the width and height of the door in 尺 (Chinese feet).
