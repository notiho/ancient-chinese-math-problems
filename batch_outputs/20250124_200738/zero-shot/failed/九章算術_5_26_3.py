今有盤池，上廣六丈，袤八丈，下廣四丈，袤六丈，深二丈。問︰積幾何？
荅曰：七萬六百六十六尺、太半尺。
負土往來七十步，其二十步上下棚除。棚除二當平道五，踟躕之間十加一，載輸之間三十步，定一返一百四十步。土籠積一尺六寸，秋程人功行五十九里半。問︰人到、積尺、用徒各幾何？
術曰：以一籠積尺乘程行步數為實。往來上下，棚除二當平道五。置定往來步數，十加一，及載輸之間三十步以為法。除之，所得即一人所到尺。以所到約積尺，即用徒人數。
荅曰：人到 a尺 。用徒 b人 。

To solve the problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. Here's the solution:

### Explanation:
1. **Basket Volume**: The volume of one basket is given as 1尺6寸, which is converted to a fraction (8/5尺).
2. **Distance Per Person**: Each person travels 59.5里, converted to a fraction (119/2里). Each 里 corresponds to 140 steps.
3. **Adjusted Steps**: The total steps are adjusted for uphill/downhill, hesitation, and loading/unloading.
4. **Volume Per Person**: The total volume of soil moved by one person is calculated by multiplying the basket volume by the adjusted steps.
5. **Pond Volume**: The volume of the pond is calculated as a trapezoidal prism.
6. **Workers Needed**: The total number of workers needed is calculated by dividing the pond volume by the volume moved by one person.

### Output:
The variables `a` and `b` will contain the results:
- `a`: The total volume of soil moved by one person (in 尺).
- `b`: The total number of workers needed.
