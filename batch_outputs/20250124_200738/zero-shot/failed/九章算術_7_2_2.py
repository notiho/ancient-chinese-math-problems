To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves determining the number of people (`a`) and the price of the item (`b`) based on the given conditions.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. If each person contributes half the price, there is an excess of 4 units.
2. If each person contributes less than half the price, there is a shortfall of 3 units.

We need to find the number of people (`a`) and the price of the item (`b`).

### Python Code:

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Let the number of people be `a` and the price of the item be `b`.

# Condition 1: If each person contributes half the price, there is an excess of 4.
# This means: a * (b / 2) = b + 4

# Condition 2: If each person contributes less than half the price, there is a shortfall of 3.
# This means: a * (b / 2 - b / (2 * a)) = b - 3

# Solve for `a` and `b`:
# From Condition 1:
# a * (b / 2) = b + 4
# a * b = 2b + 8
# a = (2b + 8) / b

# From Condition 2:
# a * (b / 2 - b / (2 * a)) = b - 3
# a * (b / 2 - b / (2 * a)) = b - 3
# a * (b / 2) - a * (b / (2 * a)) = b - 3
# a * (b / 2) - b / 2 = b - 3
# (a - 1) * (b / 2) = b - 3
# a - 1 = 2 * (b - 3) / b
# a = 2 * (b - 3) / b + 1

# Equating the two expressions for `a`:
# (2b + 8) / b = 2 * (b - 3) / b + 1
# (2b + 8) = 2 * (b - 3) + b
# 2b + 8 = 2b - 6 + b
# 2b + 8 = 3b - 6
# 8 + 6 = b
# b = 14

# Substitute b = 14 into the equation for `a`:
# a = (2b + 8) / b
# a = (2 * 14 + 8) / 14
# a = (28 + 8) / 14
# a = 36 / 14
# a = 18

# Final values:
a = 18  # Number of people
b = 14  # Price of the item

### Solution:
- Number of people (`a`): 18
- Price of the item (`b`): 14
