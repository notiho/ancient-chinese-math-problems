又有積一萬六千四百四十八億六千六百四十三萬七千五百尺。問︰為立圓徑幾何？
開立圓術曰：置積尺數，以十六乘之，九而一，所得開立方除之，即丸徑。
荅曰： a尺 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will follow the method described in the text. The given volume is \( 1644866437500 \) cubic feet. The formula for the diameter of a sphere (立圓徑) is:

1. Multiply the volume by 16.
2. Divide the result by \( \frac{9}{1} \) (which is equivalent to multiplying by \( \frac{1}{9} \)).
3. Take the cube root of the result.
4. The result is the diameter of the sphere.

Here is the Python code to compute the diameter of the sphere:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given volume in cubic feet
volume = 1644866437500

# Step 1: Multiply the volume by 16
step1 = volume * 16

# Step 2: Divide the result by 9 (equivalent to multiplying by 1/9)
step2 = step1 * Fraction(1, 9)

# Step 3: Take the cube root of the result
a = step2 ** Fraction(1, 3)

# The diameter of the sphere is stored in variable 'a'
a
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the diameter of the sphere in feet.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 14300, Actual: 14299.999999999993"""
