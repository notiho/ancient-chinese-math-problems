今有粟七斗五升、七分升之四，欲為稻。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求稻，六之，五而一。
荅曰：為稻 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, let's translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves converting a quantity of 粟 (millet) into 稻 (rice). The conversion rule is given as "六之，五而一," which means for every 6 units of millet, you get 5 units of rice.

The given quantity of millet is 7斗 (dou), 5升 (sheng), and 4/7升. We need to compute the equivalent amount of rice in 斗 (dou).

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given quantity of millet
millet = 7 + 5 / 10 + Fraction(4, 7) / 10  # Convert everything to dou

# Conversion rule: 6 units of millet give 5 units of rice
rice = millet * 5 / 6

# Result
a = rice  # The amount of rice in dou
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The solution is stored in the variable `a`, which represents the amount of rice in 斗 (dou).
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 1587/175, Actual: 6.2976190476190474"""
