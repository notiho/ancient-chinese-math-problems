今有七百三十八户，共請絲二十七斤五两。問：户得㡬何？
術曰：列絲二十七斤，以十六两乘之、納五两，得四百三十七两；又以二十四銖乘之，得一萬四百八十八銖；以七百三十八户除之即得。
答曰： a銖 奇 b銖 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much silk each household gets. The total silk is given as 27 pounds and 5 ounces, and there are 738 households. The answer is expressed in "銖" (a smaller unit of weight). Here's the Python code to compute the values of `a` and `b`:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total silk in pounds and ounces
total_pounds = 27
total_ounces = 5

# Convert total silk to ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces)
total_ounces += total_pounds * 16

# Convert total ounces to 銖 (1 ounce = 24 銖)
total_zhu = total_ounces * 24

# Number of households
households = 738

# Silk per household in 銖
silk_per_household = Fraction(total_zhu, households)

# Extract the integer part (a) and the remainder (b)
a = silk_per_household.numerator // silk_per_household.denominator
b = silk_per_household.numerator % silk_per_household.denominator

# a and b are the answers
#----- content ends here -----


"""


After running this code, `a` will contain the integer part of the silk each household gets in 銖, and `b` will contain the remainder in 銖.

Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 1421/100, Actual: 14
Variable 'b' has wrong value. Expected: 51/50, Actual: 26"""
