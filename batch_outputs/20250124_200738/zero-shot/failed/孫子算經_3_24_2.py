今有物，不知其數。三三數之，賸二；五五數之，賸三；七七數之，賸二。問：物幾何？
術曰：三三數之，賸二，置一百四十；五五數之，賸三，置六十三；七七數之，賸二，置三十。并之，得二百三十三，以二百一十減之，即得。凡三三數之，賸一，則置七十；五五數之，賸一，則置二十一；七七數之，賸一，則置十五。一百六以上，以一百五減之，即得。
答曰： a 。

"""
This is a classic Chinese remainder theorem problem. Let's translate the problem into Python code to compute the value of the unknown `a`.

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# The problem states:
# x ≡ 2 (mod 3)
# x ≡ 3 (mod 5)
# x ≡ 2 (mod 7)

# To solve this, we use the method described in the problem:
# Multiply the remainders by specific coefficients and sum them up.

# Coefficients:
coeff_3 = 140  # For mod 3
coeff_5 = 63   # For mod 5
coeff_7 = 30   # For mod 7

# Remainders:
remainder_3 = 2
remainder_5 = 3
remainder_7 = 2

# Compute the combined result:
result = coeff_3 * remainder_3 + coeff_5 * remainder_5 + coeff_7 * remainder_7

# The modulus to reduce the result:
modulus = 210  # 3 * 5 * 7

# Reduce the result modulo 210:
a = result % modulus

# The answer:
a
