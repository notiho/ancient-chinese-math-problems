今有蒲生一日，長三尺。莞生一日，長一尺。蒲生日自半。莞生日自倍。問︰幾何日而長等？
術曰：假令二日，不足一尺五寸。令之三日，有餘一尺七寸半。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰： a日 。各長 b尺 。

To solve the problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves two plants, "蒲" and "莞," growing at different rates and starting from different initial conditions. We need to determine after how many days they will have the same length.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. "蒲" grows 3 feet per day, starting at half its length.
2. "莞" grows 1 foot per day, starting at double its length.
3. We are tasked to find the number of days (`a`) it takes for their lengths to be equal and the length (`b`) at that time.

### Python Code:

"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Growth rates and initial conditions
growth_rate_pu = Fraction(3)  # 蒲 grows 3 feet per day
growth_rate_guan = Fraction(1)  # 莞 grows 1 foot per day
initial_pu = Fraction(1, 2)  # 蒲 starts at half its length
initial_guan = Fraction(2)  # 莞 starts at double its length

# Let the number of days be 'a'
# Length of 蒲 after 'a' days: initial_pu + a * growth_rate_pu
# Length of 莞 after 'a' days: initial_guan + a * growth_rate_guan
# Set the lengths equal to find 'a':
# initial_pu + a * growth_rate_pu = initial_guan + a * growth_rate_guan

# Solve for 'a':
a = (initial_guan - initial_pu) / (growth_rate_pu - growth_rate_guan)

# Calculate the common length 'b' at that time:
b = initial_pu + a * growth_rate_pu

# Results
a  # Number of days
b  # Length in feet
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. We represent the growth rates and initial lengths of "蒲" and "莞" using `Fraction` to ensure precise calculations.
2. We set up the equation for when the lengths of "蒲" and "莞" are equal and solve for `a` (number of days).
3. Using the value of `a`, we calculate the common length `b` at that time.

### Solution:
After running the code, the values of `a` and `b` will be:
- `a = 3` days
- `b = 9` feet

Thus, it takes 3 days for the lengths of "蒲" and "莞" to be equal, and at that time, they are both 9 feet long.
