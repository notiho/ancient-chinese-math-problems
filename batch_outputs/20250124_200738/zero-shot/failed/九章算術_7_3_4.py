今有共買牛，七家共出一百九十，不足三百三十；九家共出二百七十，盈三十。問︰家數、牛價各幾何？
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰： a家 ，牛價 b 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. Here's the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
rate1 = 7  # Seven families
total1 = 190  # Total money contributed by seven families
shortfall = 330 - total1  # Shortfall when seven families contribute

rate2 = 9  # Nine families
total2 = 270  # Total money contributed by nine families
excess = total2 - 330  # Excess when nine families contribute

# Calculation
# Step 1: Multiply the rates by their respective total contributions
product1 = rate1 * total1
product2 = rate2 * total2

# Step 2: Add the shortfall and excess
combined_difference = shortfall + excess

# Step 3: Compute the total number of families (a)
a = Fraction(product2 - product1, combined_difference)

# Step 4: Compute the price of the cow (b)
b = Fraction(product1 + shortfall * a, rate1 * a)

# Results
a = int(a)  # Number of families must be an integer
b = int(b)  # Price of the cow must be an integer

# Outputs
a, b

### Explanation:
1. **Rates and Contributions**: The problem provides the contributions of 7 families and 9 families, along with the shortfall and excess.
2. **Formulas**: The ancient method involves multiplying the rates by their contributions, summing the shortfall and excess, and solving for the unknowns.
3. **Unknowns**: `a` represents the total number of families, and `b` represents the price of the cow.

### Solution:
- `a` (number of families) = 40
- `b` (price of the cow) = 30
