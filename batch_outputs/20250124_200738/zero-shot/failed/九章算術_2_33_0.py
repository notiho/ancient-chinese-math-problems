今有出錢五千七百八十五，買漆一斛六斗七升、太半升。欲斗率之，問︰斗幾何。
經術術曰：以所求率乘錢數為實，以所買率為法，實如法得一。
荅曰：一斗， a錢

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost per "斗" (a unit of volume). Here's how we can translate the problem into Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_money = 5785  # Total money spent (in 錢)
volume = Fraction(1, 1) + Fraction(6, 10) + Fraction(7, 100) + Fraction(5, 200)  # Total volume in 斛, 斗, 升, 太半升

# Calculate the cost per 斗
a = total_money / volume

# Output the result
a
#----- content ends here -----


"""


Explanation:
1. The total money spent is 5785 錢.
2. The total volume is given as 1 斛 6 斗 7 升 太半升. We convert this into a single fraction:
   - 1 斛 = 1 (as a whole unit),
   - 6 斗 = 6/10 (since 1 斗 = 1/10 斛),
   - 7 升 = 7/100 (since 1 升 = 1/100 斛),
   - 太半升 = 5/200 (since 太半升 = 1/2 升 = 5/200 斛).
   Adding these together gives the total volume.
3. The formula for the cost per 斗 is derived as `total_money / volume`.

The variable `a` will store the result, which is the cost per 斗 in 錢.

Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 173550/503, Actual: 1157000/339"""
