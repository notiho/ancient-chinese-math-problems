今有丁一千五百萬，出兵四十萬。問：幾丁科一兵？
術曰：置丁一千五百萬為實，以兵四十萬為法，實如法，即得。
答曰： a 丁 b分 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to compute how many "丁" (a unit of population or labor) are required to support one "兵" (a soldier). The problem states that there are 15,000,000 丁 and 400,000 兵. The solution involves dividing the total 丁 by the total 兵.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_ding = 15000000  # 丁
total_bing = 400000    # 兵

# Compute 丁 per 兵
a = Fraction(total_ding, total_bing)

# The result is a 丁 b分
a_ding = a.numerator  # 丁
b_fen = a.denominator  # 分
#----- content ends here -----


"""


After running this code:
- `a_ding` will hold the numerator of the fraction (丁 per 兵).
- `b_fen` will hold the denominator of the fraction (分).
