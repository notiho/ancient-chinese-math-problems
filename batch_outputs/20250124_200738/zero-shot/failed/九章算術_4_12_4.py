又有積二萬五千二百八十一步。問︰為方幾何？
開方術曰：置積為實。借一算步之，超一等。議所得，以一乘所借一算為法，而以除。除已，倍法為定法。其復除。折法而下。復置借算步之如初，以復議一乘之，所得副，以加定法，以除。以所得副從定法。復除折下如前。若開之不盡者為不可開，當以面命之。若實有分者，通分內子為定實。乃開之，訖，開其母報除。若母不可開者，又以母乘定實，乃開之，訖，令如母而一。

This problem describes a method for finding the square root of a number, which is essentially solving for the side length of a square given its area. The area is given as 25,280 square steps, and the task is to compute the side length in steps.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given area
area = 25280  # in square steps

# Compute the side length (square root of the area)
a = Fraction(area).sqrt()

# The result is stored in the variable 'a' in steps
#----- content ends here -----


"""


Explanation:
- The area of the square is given as 25,280 square steps.
- To find the side length, we calculate the square root of the area.
- The result is stored in the variable `a`, which represents the side length in steps.
