今有稟粟五斛，五人分之，欲令三人得三，二人得二。問︰各幾何？
術曰：置三人，人三；二人，人二，為列衰。副并為法。以五斛乘未并者，各自為實。實如法得一斛。
荅曰： a人 ，人得 b斛 。 c人 ，人得 d斗 。

To solve the problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. Here's the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total amount of grain in hu (斛)
total_grain = 5  # in hu

# Number of people in each group
group1_people = 3  # a
group2_people = 2  # c

# Grain distribution per person in each group
group1_grain_per_person = Fraction(3, 1)  # b (in hu)
group2_grain_per_person = Fraction(2, 1)  # d (in hu)

# Total grain distributed to each group
group1_total_grain = group1_people * group1_grain_per_person
group2_total_grain = group2_people * group2_grain_per_person

# Check if the total grain matches the given amount
assert group1_total_grain + group2_total_grain == total_grain

# Assign the answers to variables
a = group1_people
b = group1_grain_per_person
c = group2_people
d = group2_grain_per_person

# Results
a, b, c, d
#----- content ends here -----

### Explanation:
1. The problem states that there are 5 hu (斛) of grain to be distributed among 5 people.
2. Three people (group1) should each receive 3 hu, and two people (group2) should each receive 2 hu.
3. We calculate the total grain distributed to each group and ensure it matches the total grain available.
4. The solution assigns the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` as described in the problem.
