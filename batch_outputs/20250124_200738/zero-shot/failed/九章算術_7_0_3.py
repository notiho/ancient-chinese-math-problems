今有共買物，人出八，盈三；人出七，不足四。問︰人數、物價各幾何？
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰： a人 ，物價 b 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical method described into Python code. Let's compute the values of the unknowns `a` (number of people) and `b` (price of the item). Here's the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
rate1 = 8  # Each person contributes 8
excess = 3  # Excess amount when each contributes 8
rate2 = 7  # Each person contributes 7
deficit = 4  # Deficit amount when each contributes 7

# Step 1: Compute the "實" (numerator) and "法" (denominator)
numerator = rate1 * rate2  # Multiply the two rates
denominator = excess + deficit  # Add the excess and deficit

# Step 2: Compute the number of people (a)
a = Fraction(numerator, denominator)

# Step 3: Compute the price of the item (b)
b = Fraction(rate1 * a - excess)

# Results
a = a  # Number of people
b = b  # Price of the item

# Output the results
a, b
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Input Data**:
   - Each person contributes `rate1 = 8`, resulting in an excess of `excess = 3`.
   - Each person contributes `rate2 = 7`, resulting in a deficit of `deficit = 4`.

2. **Method**:
   - Compute the numerator (`實`) as the product of the two rates: `rate1 * rate2`.
   - Compute the denominator (`法`) as the sum of the excess and deficit: `excess + deficit`.
   - The number of people (`a`) is the fraction of the numerator divided by the denominator.
   - The price of the item (`b`) is calculated using the formula: `b = rate1 * a - excess`.

3. **Output**:
   - The values of `a` (number of people) and `b` (price of the item) are computed as fractions.
