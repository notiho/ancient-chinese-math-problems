今有粟一十斗八升、五分升之二，欲為麥。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求菽、答、麻、麥，皆九之，十而一。
荅曰：為麥 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much 麥 (wheat) can be obtained from 粟 (millet) based on the given conversion ratio. The problem states that to convert 粟 into 麥, the ratio is 9:10 (i.e., for every 10 units of 粟, you get 9 units of 麥).

The given amount of 粟 is 10斗8升 and 2/5升. We need to convert this into 麥 using the ratio.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given amount of 粟
粟 = 10 + Fraction(8, 10) + Fraction(2, 5)

# Conversion ratio: 9/10
conversion_ratio = Fraction(9, 10)

# Calculate the amount of 麥
a = 粟 * conversion_ratio

# Result
a  # in 斗
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 麥 in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 2439/250, Actual: 252/25"""
