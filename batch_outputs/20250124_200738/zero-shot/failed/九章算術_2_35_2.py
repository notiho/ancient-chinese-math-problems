今有出錢二千三百七十，買布九匹二丈七尺。欲匹率之，問︰匹幾何？
經術術曰：以所求率乘錢數為實，以所買率為法，實如法得一。
荅曰：一匹， a錢
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of one匹 (one bolt of cloth). The total cost is 2370錢, and the total amount of cloth purchased is 9匹 and 2丈7尺. We need to convert the total amount of cloth into a single unit (丈 or 尺) and then calculate the cost per匹.

### Assumptions:
1匹 = 1 bolt of cloth  
1丈 = 10尺  

### Step-by-step solution:
1. Convert the total cloth purchased into 尺:
   \( 9匹 \times 10丈 + 2丈 = 92丈 \)  
   \( 92丈 \times 10尺 + 7尺 = 927尺 \)

2. Calculate the cost per匹:
   Using the formula provided:  
   \( 匹\率 = \frac{\text{錢數}}{\text{所買率}} \)  
   \( 匹\率 = \frac{2370錢}{927尺} \)

3. Simplify the fraction to find the cost per匹.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_money = 2370  # in 錢
total_cloth_in_pieces = 9  # in 匹
extra_cloth_in_zhang = 2  # in 丈
extra_cloth_in_chi = 7  # in 尺

# Conversion factors
zhang_to_chi = 10  # 1丈 = 10尺

# Total cloth in 尺
total_cloth_in_chi = (total_cloth_in_pieces * zhang_to_chi * 10) + (extra_cloth_in_zhang * zhang_to_chi) + extra_cloth_in_chi

# Cost per 匹
a = Fraction(total_money, total_cloth_in_chi)

# Output the result
a  # Cost per 匹 in 錢
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Final Answer:
The cost of one匹 is stored in the variable `a`, represented as a fraction in 錢.

Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 31600/129, Actual: 790/309"""
