今有委粟平地，下周一十二丈，高二丈。問︰積及為粟幾何？
委粟術曰：下周自乘，以高乘之，三十六而一。其依垣者，十八而一。其依垣內角者，九而一。程粟一斛，積二尺七寸。其米一斛，積一尺六寸、五分寸之一。其菽、答、麻、麥一斛，皆二尺四寸、十分寸之三。
荅曰：積 a尺 。為粟 b斛 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the volume of a conical pile of grain and determining how many units of grain it contains. Here's the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given dimensions of the conical pile
lower_circumference = 12  # 丈
height = 2  # 丈

# Conversion factors
zhang_to_chi = 10  # 1 丈 = 10 尺
chi_to_cun = 10  # 1 尺 = 10 寸

# Convert dimensions to 尺
lower_circumference_chi = lower_circumference * zhang_to_chi  # in 尺
height_chi = height * zhang_to_chi  # in 尺

# Formula for the volume of a conical pile (委粟術)
# Volume = (lower_circumference^2 * height) / 36
volume_chi3 = (lower_circumference_chi ** 2 * height_chi) / 36

# Conversion factors for grain
# 1 斛 of 粟 = 2 尺 7 寸 = 2.7 尺^3
# Convert 2 尺 7 寸 to a fraction in 尺^3
grain_volume_per_hu = Fraction(2, 1) + Fraction(7, 10)  # in 尺^3

# Calculate the number of 斛 of 粟
grain_hu = volume_chi3 / grain_volume_per_hu

# Assign results to variables
a = volume_chi3  # Total volume in 尺^3
b = grain_hu  # Total 粟 in 斛

# Results
a, b

### Explanation:
1. **Dimensions Conversion**: The lower circumference and height are given in 丈, so we convert them to 尺 using the conversion factor \(1 丈 = 10 尺\).
2. **Volume Calculation**: The formula for the volume of a conical pile is given as \((\text{lower circumference}^2 \times \text{height}) / 36\). This is applied in 尺^3.
3. **Grain Conversion**: The volume of 1 斛 of 粟 is given as \(2 尺 7 寸\), which is converted to a fraction in 尺^3.
4. **Final Calculation**: The total volume in 尺^3 is divided by the volume of 1 斛 of 粟 to determine the total number of 斛.

### Output:
The variables `a` and `b` will contain the total volume in 尺^3 and the total number of 斛 of 粟, respectively.
