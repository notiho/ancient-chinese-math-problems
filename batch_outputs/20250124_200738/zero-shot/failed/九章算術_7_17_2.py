今有黃金九枚，白銀一十一枚，稱之重適等。交易其一，金輕十三兩。問︰金、銀一枚各重幾何？
術曰：假令黃金三斤，白銀二斤、一十一分斤之五，不足四十九，於右行。令之黃金二斤，白銀一斤、一十一分斤之七，多一十五於左行。以分母各乘其行內之數，以盈不足維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈不足為法。實如法，得黃金重。分母乘法以除，得銀重。約之得分也。
荅曰：金重 a斤 ，銀重 b斤 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the weights of a single gold piece (`a`) and a single silver piece (`b`) such that the total weight of 9 gold pieces equals the total weight of 11 silver pieces, and the weights satisfy the given conditions.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Step 1: Define the equations based on the problem description
# Let a = weight of one gold piece (in jin)
# Let b = weight of one silver piece (in jin)

# Equation 1: 9a = 11b
# Equation 2: If gold is 2 jin and silver is (1 + 7/11) jin, the difference is 15 liang (1 jin = 16 liang)
# Equation 3: If gold is 3 jin and silver is (2 + 5/11) jin, the difference is 49 liang

# Convert liang to jin (1 jin = 16 liang)
# Equation 2 becomes: 2a - (1 + Fraction(7, 11))b = Fraction(15, 16)
# Equation 3 becomes: 3a - (2 + Fraction(5, 11))b = Fraction(49, 16)

# Step 2: Solve the system of equations
# From Equation 1: b = (9/11)a
# Substitute b into Equations 2 and 3

# Equation 2:
# 2a - (1 + Fraction(7, 11)) * (9/11)a = Fraction(15, 16)
# Simplify:
# 2a - (Fraction(11, 11) + Fraction(7, 11)) * (9/11)a = Fraction(15, 16)
# 2a - (Fraction(18, 11)) * a = Fraction(15, 16)
# (2 - Fraction(18, 11)) * a = Fraction(15, 16)
# Fraction(4, 11) * a = Fraction(15, 16)
# a = (Fraction(15, 16)) / (Fraction(4, 11))
# a = Fraction(15, 16) * Fraction(11, 4)
a = Fraction(15, 16) * Fraction(11, 4)

# From Equation 1: b = (9/11)a
b = Fraction(9, 11) * a

# Step 3: Output the results
a, b

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Define the Variables**: `a` is the weight of one gold piece in jin, and `b` is the weight of one silver piece in jin.
2. **Set Up the Equations**:
   - Equation 1 relates the total weights of gold and silver: `9a = 11b`.
   - Equation 2 and Equation 3 are derived from the problem's conditions, converted to jin.
3. **Solve the System of Equations**:
   - Use Equation 1 to express `b` in terms of `a`.
   - Substitute `b` into the other equations to solve for `a`.
   - Once `a` is found, calculate `b`.
4. **Output the Results**: The values of `a` and `b` are computed as fractions.

### Final Answer:
The weights of one gold piece (`a`) and one silver piece (`b`) are stored in the variables `a` and `b`, respectively.
