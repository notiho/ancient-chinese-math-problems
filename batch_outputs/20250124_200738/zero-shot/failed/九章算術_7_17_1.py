今有黃金九枚，白銀一十一枚，稱之重適等。交易其一，金輕十三兩。問︰金、銀一枚各重幾何？
術曰：假令黃金三斤，白銀二斤、一十一分斤之五，不足四十九，於右行。令之黃金二斤，白銀一斤、一十一分斤之七，多一十五於左行。以分母各乘其行內之數，以盈不足維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈不足為法。實如法，得黃金重。分母乘法以除，得銀重。約之得分也。
荅曰：金重 a斤 ，銀重 b斤 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the weights of a single piece of gold (`a`) and a single piece of silver (`b`) such that the total weight of 9 pieces of gold equals the total weight of 11 pieces of silver, and the conditions given in the problem are satisfied.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given conditions
# Let the weight of one piece of gold be 'a' (in jin)
# Let the weight of one piece of silver be 'b' (in jin)

# First condition: 9a = 11b
# Second condition: If gold is reduced by 13 liang (13/16 jin), then:
# 9(a - 13/16) = 11b - 49
# Third condition: If gold is increased by 15 liang (15/16 jin), then:
# 9(a + 15/16) = 11b + 49

# Solve the equations step by step
# From the first condition: 9a = 11b
# => b = (9/11)a

# Substitute b = (9/11)a into the second condition:
# 9(a - 13/16) = 11((9/11)a) - 49
# Simplify:
# 9a - 9(13/16) = 9a - 49
# -9(13/16) = -49
# 13/16 = 49/9 (This is consistent and does not provide new information)

# Substitute b = (9/11)a into the third condition:
# 9(a + 15/16) = 11((9/11)a) + 49
# Simplify:
# 9a + 9(15/16) = 9a + 49
# 9(15/16) = 49
# 15/16 = 49/9 (This is consistent and does not provide new information)

# From the first condition, we can directly solve for a and b:
a = Fraction(16, 1)  # Weight of one piece of gold in jin
b = Fraction(9, 11) * a  # Weight of one piece of silver in jin

# Final results
a  # Weight of one piece of gold in jin
b  # Weight of one piece of silver in jin

### Explanation:
1. The problem states that the total weight of 9 pieces of gold equals the total weight of 11 pieces of silver. This gives the equation `9a = 11b`.
2. Additional conditions involve reducing or increasing the weight of gold by specific amounts and observing the resulting imbalance. These conditions are consistent with the first equation and do not provide new information.
3. Solving the first equation directly gives the weight of one piece of gold (`a`) and one piece of silver (`b`).

### Final Answer:
- `a = 16` jin (weight of one piece of gold)
- `b = 13` jin (weight of one piece of silver)
