又有積一萬六千四百四十八億六千六百四十三萬七千五百尺。問︰為立圓徑幾何？
開立圓術曰：置積尺數，以十六乘之，九而一，所得開立方除之，即丸徑。
荅曰： a尺 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical method into Python code. The problem involves finding the diameter of a sphere (立圓徑) given its volume (積). The method described involves multiplying the volume by 16, dividing by 9, and then taking the cube root of the result. Finally, the diameter is obtained by dividing the cube root by 1.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction
import math

# Given volume in cubic 尺
volume = Fraction(1644866437500)  # 16,448,664,375,000 cubic 尺

# Step 1: Multiply the volume by 16
step1 = volume * 16

# Step 2: Divide the result by 9
step2 = step1 / 9

# Step 3: Take the cube root of the result
cube_root = step2 ** Fraction(1, 3)

# Step 4: The diameter is the cube root (divided by 1, which doesn't change the value)
a = cube_root

# The result is stored in variable 'a'
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the diameter of the sphere in 尺.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 14300, Actual: 14299.999999999993"""
