"""
今有粟七斗八升，欲為豉。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求豉，六十三之，五十而一。
荅曰：為豉 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much 豉 (fermented soybeans) can be made from 7斗8升 of 粟 (millet). The rule provided states that for every 63 units of 粟, 50 units of 豉 are produced.

### Step-by-step solution:
1. Convert 7斗8升 into a single unit. Since 1斗 = 10升, we have:
   \( 7斗8升 = 7 \times 10 + 8 = 78升 \).

2. Use the given ratio to calculate the amount of 豉. The ratio is:
   \( 63粟 : 50豉 \).

   This means for every 63 units of 粟, 50 units of 豉 are produced. Therefore, the amount of 豉 is:
   \( \text{豉} = \text{粟} \times \frac{50}{63} \).

3. Substitute the total 粟 (78升) into the formula:
   \( \text{豉} = 78 \times \frac{50}{63} \).

4. Simplify the calculation.

Here is the Python code for the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
粟 = Fraction(78)  # 7斗8升 converted to 升
ratio = Fraction(50, 63)  # Ratio of 粟 to 豉

# Calculate the amount of 豉
a = 粟 * ratio

# Result
a  # This is the amount of 豉 in 斗
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 豉 in terms of 斗.

"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 2457/250, Actual: 1300/21"""
