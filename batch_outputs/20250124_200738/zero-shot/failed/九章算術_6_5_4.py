今有人當稟粟二斛。倉無粟，欲與米一、菽二，以當所稟粟。問︰各幾何？
術曰：置米一、菽二求為粟之數。并之得三、九分之八，以為法。亦置米一、菽二，而以粟二斛乘之，各自為實。實如法得一斛。
荅曰：米 a斗 。菽 b斛 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the equivalent amounts of 米 (rice) and 菽 (beans) to substitute for 粟 (millet). Here's the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
粟 = 2  # 粟 is given as 2 斛
米_to_粟 = Fraction(1, 1)  # 米 is equivalent to 1 粟
菽_to_粟 = Fraction(2, 1)  # 菽 is equivalent to 2 粟

# Total equivalent 粟 for 米 and 菽
total_equivalent_粟 = 米_to_粟 + 菽_to_粟  # 米 + 菽 = 3 粟

# Proportion of 米 and 菽 in the total equivalent 粟
米_fraction = 米_to_粟 / total_equivalent_粟
菽_fraction = 菽_to_粟 / total_equivalent_粟

# Calculate 米 and 菽 amounts
a = 粟 * 米_fraction  # 米 in 斗
b = 粟 * 菽_fraction  # 菽 in 斛

# Results
a  # 米 in 斗
b  # 菽 in 斛
#----- content ends here -----

### Explanation:
1. **Given**: 粟 is 2 斛, 米 is equivalent to 1 粟, and 菽 is equivalent to 2 粟.
2. The total equivalent 粟 for 米 and 菽 is the sum of their individual equivalents (1 + 2 = 3 粟).
3. The proportion of 米 in the total equivalent 粟 is \( \frac{1}{3} \), and the proportion of 菽 is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
4. Multiply these proportions by the total 粟 (2 斛) to find the amounts of 米 and 菽.

### Solution:
- \( a = \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \) 斗
- \( b = \frac{2}{3} \times 2 = \frac{4}{3} \) 斛

The values of \( a \) and \( b \) are:
- \( a = \frac{2}{3} \) 斗
- \( b = \frac{4}{3} \) 斛
