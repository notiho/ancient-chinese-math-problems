今有大夫、不更、簪褭、上造、公士，凡五人，共出百錢。欲令高爵出少，以次漸多，問︰各幾何？
返衰術曰：列置衰而令相乘，動者為不動者衰。術曰：置爵數各自為衰，而返衰之，副并為法。以百錢乘未并者各自為實。實如法得一錢。
荅曰：大夫出 a錢 。不更出 b錢 。簪褭出 c錢 。上造出 d錢 。公士出 e錢 。

To solve this problem, we need to translate the ancient Chinese mathematical method described into Python code. The problem involves distributing 100 coins among five ranks (大夫, 不更, 簪褭, 上造, 公士) such that higher ranks contribute fewer coins, and the contributions increase progressively for lower ranks.

Here is the Python code to compute the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the ranks and their respective weights (衰)
weights = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # 大夫, 不更, 簪褭, 上造, 公士

# Calculate the total weight (法)
total_weight = sum(Fraction(1, w) for w in weights)

# Calculate the contributions for each rank
a = Fraction(100) * Fraction(1, weights[0]) / total_weight  # 大夫
b = Fraction(100) * Fraction(1, weights[1]) / total_weight  # 不更
c = Fraction(100) * Fraction(1, weights[2]) / total_weight  # 簪褭
d = Fraction(100) * Fraction(1, weights[3]) / total_weight  # 上造
e = Fraction(100) * Fraction(1, weights[4]) / total_weight  # 公士

# The results are stored in variables a, b, c, d, and e

### Explanation:
1. **Weights (衰):** The weights are assigned as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for the ranks 大夫, 不更, 簪褭, 上造, and 公士 respectively. These weights represent the inverse relationship between rank and contribution.
2. **Total Weight (法):** The total weight is the sum of the reciprocals of the weights:  
   \[
   \text{total\_weight} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5}
   \]
3. **Individual Contributions:** Each rank's contribution is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{contribution} = \frac{\text{total money} \times \frac{1}{\text{weight}}}{\text{total\_weight}}
   \]
   This ensures that the contributions are proportional to the inverse of the weights.

### Results:
After running the code, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` will be the contributions of 大夫, 不更, 簪褭, 上造, and 公士 respectively.
