今有戶高多於廣六尺八寸，兩隅相去適一丈。問︰戶高、廣各幾何？
術曰：令一丈自乘為實。半相多，令自乘，倍之，減實，半其餘。以開方除之，所得，減相多之半，即戶廣。加相多之半，即戶高。
荅曰：廣 a尺 ；高 b尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the height and width of a door, given that the height exceeds the width by 6尺8寸 (6.8尺 in decimal form), and the diagonal of the door is 1丈 (10尺). Here's the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
diagonal = Fraction(10)  # 1丈 = 10尺
difference = Fraction(6) + Fraction(8, 10)  # 6尺8寸 = 6.8尺

# Step 1: Let the diagonal squared be the "實" (diagonal^2)
diagonal_squared = diagonal ** 2

# Step 2: Half the difference (相多之半)
half_difference = difference / 2

# Step 3: Square the half difference and double it
half_difference_squared_doubled = 2 * (half_difference ** 2)

# Step 4: Subtract the doubled square of the half difference from the diagonal squared
remaining = diagonal_squared - half_difference_squared_doubled

# Step 5: Take the square root of the remaining value (開方)
# Since we are not using external functions, we will compute the square root manually
square_root = Fraction(int(remaining.numerator ** 0.5), int(remaining.denominator ** 0.5))

# Step 6: Divide the square root by 2 (半其餘)
half_square_root = square_root / 2

# Step 7: Compute the width (廣) and height (高)
a = half_square_root - half_difference  # Width (廣)
b = half_square_root + half_difference  # Height (高)

# The solutions are:
# a (width) in 尺
# b (height) in 尺

This code computes the width `a` and height `b` of the door in 尺. Note that the `Fraction` class is used to ensure precise calculations, especially for non-integer values.
