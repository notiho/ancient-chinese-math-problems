又有三人，三分人之一，分六錢三分錢之一，四分錢之三。問：人得幾何？
經分術曰：以人數為法，錢數為實，實如法而一。有分者通之；重有分者同而通之。
荅曰：人得 a錢 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. Here's the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
people = 3  # Three people
money = Fraction(6) + Fraction(3, 10) + Fraction(3, 4)  # Total money (6錢 + 3/10錢 + 3/4錢)

# Calculate money per person
a = money / people  # Each person gets the same amount of money

# Result
a  # This is the amount of money each person gets
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` represents the amount of money each person gets. It is calculated by dividing the total money by the number of people. The result is expressed as a fraction.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 17/8, Actual: 47/20"""
