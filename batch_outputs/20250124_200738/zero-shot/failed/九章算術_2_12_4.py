今有粟五斗、太半升，欲為麻。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以粟求菽、答、麻、麥，皆九之，十而一。
荅曰：為麻 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many "斗" (a unit of volume) of 麻 (hemp) can be obtained from the given 粟 (millet). The rule states that to convert 粟 into 麻, we multiply the amount of 粟 by 9/10.

Here is the Python code to compute the value of "a":


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
粟 = Fraction(5) + Fraction(1, 2)  # 5斗 and 太半升 (太半升 = 1/2斗)

# Conversion rule: multiply by 9/10
a = 粟 * Fraction(9, 10)

# Result
a  # a is the amount of 麻 in 斗
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the result in terms of "斗".
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 114/25, Actual: 99/20"""
