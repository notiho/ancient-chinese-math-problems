今有糲飯七斗六升、七分升之四，欲為飧。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以糲飯求飧，六之，五而一。
荅曰：為飧 a斗 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves converting 糲飯 (coarse rice) into 飧 (cooked rice). The rule given is "六之，五而一," which means for every 6 parts of 糲飯, you get 5 parts of 飧. 

The total amount of 糲飯 is given as 7斗6升 and 7分升之4. We will compute the total amount of 飧 (cooked rice) in terms of 斗.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# 糲飯 (coarse rice) in terms of 斗
coarse_rice = 7 + Fraction(6, 10) + Fraction(4, 10 * 10)

# Conversion rule: 6 parts of coarse rice yield 5 parts of 飧 (cooked rice)
a = coarse_rice * Fraction(5, 6)

# Output the result
a  # The amount of 飧 in 斗
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will hold the result, which is the amount of 飧 (cooked rice) in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 1608/175, Actual: 191/30"""
