今有女子善織，日自倍，五日織五尺。問︰日織幾何？
術曰：置一、二、四、八、十六為列衰，副并為法，以五尺乘未并者，各自為實，實如法得一尺。
荅曰：初日織 a寸 。次日織 b寸 。次日織 c寸 。次日織 d尺 。次日織 e尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem describes a scenario where a woman weaves cloth, doubling her output each day, and produces a total of 5 feet (or 60 inches) in 5 days. We need to calculate how much she weaves each day.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total woven cloth in inches (5 feet = 60 inches)
total_inches = 60

# The daily weaving amounts are in a geometric progression: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 (in units of inches)
# Let the first day's weaving amount be "a" inches.
# Then the amounts woven each day are: a, 2a, 4a, 8a, 16a.

# Total weaving over 5 days:
# a + 2a + 4a + 8a + 16a = total_inches
# 31a = total_inches
a = Fraction(total_inches, 31)

# Calculate the weaving amounts for each day
b = 2 * a
c = 4 * a
d = 8 * a
e = 16 * a

# The results are:
a, b, c, d, e
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. The total woven cloth is given as 5 feet, which is converted to inches (1 foot = 12 inches, so 5 feet = 60 inches).
2. The daily weaving amounts follow a geometric progression: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.
3. The sum of the progression over 5 days is \( a + 2a + 4a + 8a + 16a = 31a \), which equals the total woven cloth (60 inches).
4. Solving for \( a \), we find \( a = \frac{60}{31} \).
5. The amounts woven each day are then calculated as \( a, 2a, 4a, 8a, 16a \).

### Output:
The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` represent the amounts woven each day in inches:
- \( a = \frac{60}{31} \) inches
- \( b = \frac{120}{31} \) inches
- \( c = \frac{240}{31} \) inches
- \( d = \frac{480}{31} \) inches
- \( e = \frac{960}{31} \) inches
