今有御米十四斗，欲為粟。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以御米求粟，五十之，二十一而一。
荅曰：為粟 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem states that we have 14斗 of 御米 (imperial rice) and we want to convert it into 粟 (millet). The conversion ratio is given as "五十之，二十一而一," which means 50 units of 御米 can be converted into 21 units of 粟.

Here is the Python code to compute the value of "a" (the amount of 粟):


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
imperial_rice = 14  # in 斗
conversion_ratio = Fraction(21, 50)  # 21 units of 粟 per 50 units of 御米

# Compute the amount of 粟
a = imperial_rice * conversion_ratio  # in 斗

# Result
a  # a is the amount of 粟 in 斗
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the result in terms of 粟 (斗).
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 100/3, Actual: 147/25"""
