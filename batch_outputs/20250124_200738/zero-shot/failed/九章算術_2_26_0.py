今有糲飯七斗六升、七分升之四，欲為飧。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以糲飯求飧，六之，五而一。
荅曰：為飧 a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves converting 糲飯 (coarse rice) into 飧 (cooked rice). The rule provided is: "六之，五而一," which means for every 6 parts of 糲飯, you get 5 parts of 飧. Let's compute the value of `a` (amount of 飧 in 斗).

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# 糲飯 (coarse rice) in 斗, 升, and 分升
coarse_rice = Fraction(7) + Fraction(6, 10) + Fraction(4, 100)  # 7斗6升4分升

# Conversion rule: 6 parts of 糲飯 yield 5 parts of 飧
conversion_ratio = Fraction(5, 6)

# Calculate 飧 (cooked rice)
a = coarse_rice * conversion_ratio  # in 斗

# Result
a  # a斗
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will hold the amount of 飧 (cooked rice) in 斗.
"""


"""
Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 1608/175, Actual: 191/30"""
