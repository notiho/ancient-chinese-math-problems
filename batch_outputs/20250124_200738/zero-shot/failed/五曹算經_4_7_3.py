又有倉從一丈九尺廣一丈五尺高一丈三尺。問：受粟㡬何？
術曰：列從一丈九尺以廣一十五尺乘之得二百八十五尺又以高一十三尺乘之得三千七百五尺以斛法一尺六寸二分除之即得。
答曰： a斛 奇 b分 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of a storage space (倉) and then convert it into a measurement of "斛" (a traditional Chinese unit of volume). The dimensions of the storage space are given in units of "丈" and "尺". The conversion factor is also provided: 1 斛 = 1 尺 6 寸 2 分.

### Steps:
1. Convert all dimensions into "尺" (since 1 丈 = 10 尺).
2. Compute the volume of the storage space in cubic 尺.
3. Divide the volume by the conversion factor (1 尺 6 寸 2 分 = 1.62 尺) to find the number of 斛 and the remainder in 分.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Dimensions of the storage space
length = Fraction(1, 1) * 10 + 9  # 1 丈 9 尺 = 19 尺
width = Fraction(1, 1) * 10 + 5   # 1 丈 5 尺 = 15 尺
height = Fraction(1, 1) * 10 + 3  # 1 丈 3 尺 = 13 尺

# Conversion factor: 1 斛 = 1 尺 6 寸 2 分 = 1.62 尺
conversion_factor = Fraction(162, 100)  # 1.62 in fractional form

# Compute the volume in cubic 尺
volume = length * width * height  # Volume = length × width × height

# Compute the number of 斛 and the remainder in 分
a = volume // conversion_factor  # Integer part (number of 斛)
remainder = volume % conversion_factor  # Remainder in 尺
b = remainder * 100  # Convert remainder to 分 (1 尺 = 100 分)

# Final results
a = int(a)  # Number of 斛
b = int(b)  # Number of 分
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. The dimensions are converted into "尺" by multiplying the "丈" part by 10 and adding the "尺" part.
2. The volume is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.
3. The conversion factor is represented as a fraction (1.62 = 162/100).
4. The number of 斛 (`a`) is obtained by integer division of the volume by the conversion factor.
5. The remainder is converted into 分 by multiplying it by 100.

### Final Answer:
The variables `a` and `b` will contain the number of 斛 and 分, respectively.
