今有戶高多於廣六尺八寸，兩隅相去適一丈。問︰戶高、廣各幾何？
術曰：令一丈自乘為實。半相多，令自乘，倍之，減實，半其餘。以開方除之，所得，減相多之半，即戶廣。加相多之半，即戶高。
荅曰：廣 a尺 ；高 b尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the height (`b`) and width (`a`) of a door, given that the height exceeds the width by 6尺8寸 (6.8尺), and the diagonal of the door is 1丈 (10尺).

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
diagonal = Fraction(10)  # 1丈 = 10尺
difference = Fraction(6) + Fraction(8, 10)  # 6尺8寸 = 6.8尺

# Step 1: Let the diagonal squared be the "實" (diagonal^2)
diagonal_squared = diagonal ** 2

# Step 2: Half the difference (相多之半)
half_difference = difference / 2

# Step 3: Square the half difference and double it
half_difference_squared_doubled = 2 * (half_difference ** 2)

# Step 4: Subtract the above from the diagonal squared
remaining = diagonal_squared - half_difference_squared_doubled

# Step 5: Take the square root of the remaining value (開方)
# Since we are not using external libraries, we calculate the square root manually
square_root = remaining ** Fraction(1, 2)

# Step 6: Calculate the width (廣, a) and height (高, b)
a = square_root - half_difference  # Width
b = square_root + half_difference  # Height

# Results
a, b

### Explanation:
1. The diagonal of the door is given as 1丈 (10尺). Its square is calculated as `diagonal_squared`.
2. The difference between the height and width is given as 6尺8寸 (6.8尺). Half of this difference is `half_difference`.
3. The square of `half_difference` is doubled and subtracted from `diagonal_squared` to get the remaining value.
4. The square root of the remaining value is calculated to find the base width.
5. The width (`a`) is found by subtracting `half_difference` from the square root, and the height (`b`) is found by adding `half_difference` to the square root.

### Final Answer:
The variables `a` and `b` will contain the width and height of the door in 尺.
