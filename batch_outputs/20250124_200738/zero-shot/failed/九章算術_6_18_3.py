今有竹九節，下三節容四升，上四節容三升。問︰中間二節欲均容各多少？
術曰：以下三節分四升為下率，以上四節分三升為上率。上下率以少減多，餘為實。置四節、三節，各半之，以減九節，餘為法。實如法得一升，即衰相去也。下率，一升、少半升者，下第二節容也。
荅曰：下初， a升 ，次 b升 ，次 c升 ，次 d升 ，次 e升 ，次 f升 ，次 g升 ，次 h升 ，次 i升 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves determining the volume of liquid each of the middle two sections of a bamboo can hold, given the volumes of the lower three and upper four sections.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_sections = 9  # Total sections of the bamboo
lower_sections = 3  # Lower three sections
upper_sections = 4  # Upper four sections
lower_volume = 4  # Volume of liquid in lower three sections (in 升)
upper_volume = 3  # Volume of liquid in upper four sections (in 升)

# Calculate the rates (volume per section)
lower_rate = Fraction(lower_volume, lower_sections)  # Volume per section in lower three sections
upper_rate = Fraction(upper_volume, upper_sections)  # Volume per section in upper four sections

# Calculate the difference in rates
rate_difference = lower_rate - upper_rate  # Difference in rates

# Calculate the middle two sections' volume
middle_sections = 2  # Middle two sections
middle_rate = rate_difference / middle_sections  # Volume per section in middle two sections

# Assign the volumes to variables
a = lower_rate  # Volume of the first section
b = lower_rate  # Volume of the second section
c = lower_rate  # Volume of the third section
d = middle_rate  # Volume of the fourth section (first middle section)
e = middle_rate  # Volume of the fifth section (second middle section)
f = upper_rate  # Volume of the sixth section
g = upper_rate  # Volume of the seventh section
h = upper_rate  # Volume of the eighth section
i = upper_rate  # Volume of the ninth section

# Results
a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i
