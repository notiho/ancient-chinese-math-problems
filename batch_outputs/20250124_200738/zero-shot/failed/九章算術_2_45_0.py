To solve this problem, we need to determine the values of \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \) based on the given problem. The problem involves dividing 5,820 arrows into two groups, each with a different price per unit, such that the total cost is 980 coins. Let's translate this into Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_money = 980  # Total money in coins
total_arrows = 5820  # Total number of arrows

# Let the rates be 1 coin for b arrows and 1 coin for d arrows
# The total cost is split into two groups: a arrows at rate of b arrows per coin, and c arrows at rate of d arrows per coin
# We solve for a, b, c, and d

# Assume b = 7 (7 arrows per coin) and d = 3 (3 arrows per coin) as a plausible solution
b = 7
d = 3

# Calculate the number of arrows in each group
# Let a be the number of arrows at rate b, and c be the number of arrows at rate d
# Total money = (a / b) + (c / d)
# Total arrows = a + c

# Solve for a and c
a = Fraction((total_money * d - total_arrows), (d - b))
c = total_arrows - a

# Output the results
a = int(a)  # Convert to integer
c = int(c)  # Convert to integer

# Results
print("a =", a, "arrows at rate of 1 coin for", b, "arrows")
print("c =", c, "arrows at rate of 1 coin for", d, "arrows")

### Explanation:
1. The total money is split between two groups of arrows, each with a different rate.
2. We assume plausible rates \( b = 7 \) and \( d = 3 \) (7 arrows per coin and 3 arrows per coin, respectively).
3. Using the equations:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total arrows} = a + c
   \]
   We solve for \( a \) and \( c \).
4. The results are printed, showing the number of arrows in each group and their respective rates.
