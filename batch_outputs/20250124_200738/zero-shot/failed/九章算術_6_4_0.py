今有粟七斗，三人分舂之，一人為糲米，一人為粺米，一人為鑿米，令米數等。問︰取粟為米各幾何？
術曰：列置糲米三十，粺米二十七，鑿米二十四，而反衰之，副并為法。以七斗乘未并者，各自為取粟實。實如法得一斗。若求米等者，以本率各乘定所取粟為實，以粟率五十為法，實如法得一斗。
荅曰：糲米取粟 a斗 。粺米取粟 b斗 。鑿米取粟 c斗 。為米各 d斗 。

To solve the problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. Here's the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_grain = 7  # in dou
grain_rates = [30, 27, 24]  # rates for 糲米, 粺米, 鑿米 respectively
grain_sum_rate = sum(grain_rates)  # sum of rates

# Calculate the amount of grain each person takes
a = Fraction(total_grain * grain_rates[0], grain_sum_rate)  # 糲米取粟
b = Fraction(total_grain * grain_rates[1], grain_sum_rate)  # 粺米取粟
c = Fraction(total_grain * grain_rates[2], grain_sum_rate)  # 鑿米取粟

# Calculate the amount of 米 each person produces
total_rice_rate = 50  # rate for 米
d = Fraction(total_grain, total_rice_rate)  # 米 produced by each person

# Results
a, b, c, d

### Explanation:
1. **Grain Rates**: The rates for 糲米, 粺米, and 鑿米 are given as 30, 27, and 24 respectively.
2. **Total Grain**: The total grain is 7 dou.
3. **Grain Distribution**: Each person's grain is calculated by multiplying the total grain by their respective rate and dividing by the sum of all rates.
4. **Rice Production**: The rice produced by each person is calculated using the total grain and the rice rate (50).

### Results:
- `a`: Amount of grain taken by the first person (糲米).
- `b`: Amount of grain taken by the second person (粺米).
- `c`: Amount of grain taken by the third person (鑿米).
- `d`: Amount of rice produced by each person.
