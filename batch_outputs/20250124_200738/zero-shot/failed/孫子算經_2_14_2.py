今有木，方三尺，高三尺，欲方五寸作枕一枚。問：得幾何？
術曰：置方三尺，自相乘，得九尺，以高三尺乘之，得二十七尺，以一尺木八枕乘之，即得。
答曰： a枚 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many wooden pillows (枕) can be made from a wooden block with dimensions 3 feet by 3 feet by 3 feet, where each pillow is a cube with dimensions 5 inches by 5 inches by 5 inches.

### Step-by-step solution:
1. Calculate the volume of the wooden block in cubic feet.
2. Convert the dimensions of one pillow from inches to feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches).
3. Calculate the volume of one pillow in cubic feet.
4. Divide the total volume of the wooden block by the volume of one pillow to determine how many pillows can be made.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Dimensions of the wooden block
block_side = 3  # in feet
block_volume = block_side * block_side * block_side  # cubic feet

# Dimensions of one pillow
pillow_side = Fraction(5, 12)  # 5 inches converted to feet
pillow_volume = pillow_side * pillow_side * pillow_side  # cubic feet

# Calculate the number of pillows
a = block_volume // pillow_volume  # Integer division to get the number of whole pillows
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation of the variables:
- `block_volume` is the total volume of the wooden block in cubic feet.
- `pillow_volume` is the volume of one pillow in cubic feet.
- `a` is the number of whole pillows that can be made from the wooden block.

### Final Answer:
The value of `a` will be the number of pillows.

Variable 'a' has wrong value. Expected: 216, Actual: 373"""
