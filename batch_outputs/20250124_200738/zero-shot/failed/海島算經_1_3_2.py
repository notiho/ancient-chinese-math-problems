今有望深谷，偃矩岸上，令句高六尺。從句端望谷底，入下股九尺一寸。又設重矩于上，其矩間相去三丈。更從句端望谷底，入上股八尺五寸。問谷深幾何？
術曰：置矩間，以上股乘之，為實。上、下股相減，餘為法，除之。所得以句高減之，即得谷深。
答曰： a丈 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the depth of a valley ("谷深") based on the given measurements and relationships.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
句高 = Fraction(6, 1)  # 6尺
下股 = Fraction(9, 1) + Fraction(1, 10)  # 9尺1寸 (1寸 = 1/10尺)
上股 = Fraction(8, 1) + Fraction(5, 10)  # 8尺5寸 (5寸 = 5/10尺)
矩間 = Fraction(30, 1)  # 3丈 (1丈 = 10尺)

# Calculation
實 = 矩間 * 上股  # 矩間 multiplied by 上股
法 = 下股 - 上股  # Difference between 下股 and 上股
谷深 = 實 / 法  # Divide 實 by 法
谷深 = 谷深 - 句高  # Subtract 句高 from the result

# Result
a = 谷深  # Depth of the valley in 丈
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Input Data**:
   - `句高` is the height of the horizontal beam (6尺).
   - `下股` is the depth seen from the first beam (9尺1寸, converted to `9 + 1/10`).
   - `上股` is the depth seen from the second beam (8尺5寸, converted to `8 + 5/10`).
   - `矩間` is the distance between the two beams (3丈, converted to `30尺`).

2. **Steps**:
   - Multiply the distance between the beams (`矩間`) by the upper depth (`上股`) to get `實`.
   - Subtract the upper depth (`上股`) from the lower depth (`下股`) to get `法`.
   - Divide `實` by `法` to find the depth of the valley (`谷深`).
   - Subtract the height of the horizontal beam (`句高`) from the result to get the final depth.

3. **Output**:
   - The result is stored in the variable `a`, representing the depth of the valley in 丈.

This code uses the `Fraction` class to ensure precise calculations with fractional units.
