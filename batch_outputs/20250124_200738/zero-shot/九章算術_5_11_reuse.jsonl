Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Problem Analysis:\n1. The total work is 33,582 \"\u4eba\u529f\" (person-work units), with a shortfall of 14\u5c3a4\u5bf8 (14 feet and 4 tenths of a foot).\n2. 1,000 people arrive first, and we need to calculate how much length (\u88a4) they can complete.\n3. The formula provided is:\n   - Multiply the work done by one person per foot by the number of people who arrived first.\n   - Add the upper and lower widths, divide by 2 to get the average width, and multiply by the depth to calculate the length.\n\n### Assumptions:\n- The units are consistent, and we will convert everything into \"\u5c3a\" (feet) for calculation.\n- The shortfall of 14\u5c3a4\u5bf8 is equivalent to \\( 14 + \\frac{4}{10} = 14.4 \\) feet.\n\n### Python Code:\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Given data\ntotal_work = 33582  # Total person-work units\nshortfall = Fraction(14, 1) + Fraction(4, 10)  # Shortfall in feet\nwork_done_per_person_per_foot = Fraction(1, 1)  # Work done by one person per foot\npeople_arrived_first = 1000  # Number of people who arrived first\nupper_width = Fraction(1, 1)  # Upper width (assumed to be 1 foot)\nlower_width = Fraction(1, 1)  # Lower width (assumed to be 1 foot)\ndepth = Fraction(1, 1)  # Depth (assumed to be 1 foot)\n\n# Calculate the average width\naverage_width = (upper_width + lower_width) / 2\n\n# Calculate the work done by the first group of people\nwork_done_by_first_group = work_done_per_person_per_foot * people_arrived_first\n\n# Calculate the length (\u88a4) in feet\na = work_done_by_first_group / (average_width * depth)\n\n# Convert the result to \u4e08 (1 \u4e08 = 10 \u5c3a)\na = a / 10\n\n# Output the result\na\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. We use the `Fraction` class to ensure precise calculations, especially for non-integer values.\n2. The formula for the length (\u88a4) is derived from the problem statement:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length (\u88a4)} = \\frac{\\text{Work done by the first group}}{\\text{Average width} \\times \\text{Depth}}\n   \\]\n3.
