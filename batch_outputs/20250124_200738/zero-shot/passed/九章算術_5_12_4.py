今有方堡壔方一丈六尺，高一丈五尺。問︰積幾何？
術曰：方自乘，以高乘之，即積尺。
荅曰： a尺 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism (方堡壔). The dimensions are given in terms of length, width, and height. Since the base is square, the length and width are the same. The unit of the answer is in square "尺" (Chinese feet).

The dimensions are:
- Side length of the square base: 1丈6尺 = 16尺 (1丈 = 10尺)
- Height: 1丈5尺 = 15尺

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height} \]

Here is the Python code to compute the answer:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Dimensions in 尺
side_length = 16  # 1丈6尺 = 16尺
height = 15       # 1丈5尺 = 15尺

# Calculate the base area (side_length squared)
base_area = side_length * side_length

# Calculate the volume
a = base_area * height  # Volume in 尺³

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The value of `a` will be the volume in cubic 尺.
