今有圓田周三百步，徑一百步。問：得田幾何？
術曰：先置周三百步，半之，得一百五十步；又置徑一百步半之，得五十步，相乘，得七千五百步，以畝法二百四十步除之，即得。
答曰： a畝 ，奇 b步 。

To solve this problem, we will compute the area of a circular field given its circumference and diameter. The formula for the area of a circle is derived from its radius. The problem provides the circumference (周) and diameter (徑), and we are tasked to calculate the area in terms of 畝 (a traditional Chinese unit of area) and remaining 步.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
circumference = 300  # 周 in 步
diameter = 100       # 徑 in 步

# Step 1: Compute the radius
radius = diameter / 2  # 半徑 in 步

# Step 2: Compute the semi-circumference
semi_circumference = circumference / 2  # 半周 in 步

# Step 3: Compute the area in 步^2
area_in_steps_squared = semi_circumference * radius

# Step 4: Convert the area into 畝 and 步
# 1 畝 = 240 步^2
area_in_mu = area_in_steps_squared // 240  # Integer part (畝)
remaining_steps = area_in_steps_squared % 240  # Remainder (步)

# Assign the results to variables
a = area_in_mu
b = remaining_steps

# Results
a, b
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. The radius is calculated as half of the diameter.
2. The semi-circumference is calculated as half of the circumference.
3. The area of the circular field is calculated as the product of the semi-circumference and the radius.
4. The area is then converted into 畝 (integer part) and 步 (remainder) using the conversion factor \(1 \text{ 畝} = 240 \text{ 步}^2\).

### Final Answer:
The variables `a` and `b` will contain the number of 畝 and the remaining 步, respectively.
