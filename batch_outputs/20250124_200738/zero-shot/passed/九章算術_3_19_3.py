今有貸人千錢，月息三十。今有貸人七百五十錢，九日歸之，問︰息幾何？
術曰：以月三十日，乘千錢為法。以息三十乘今所貸錢數，又以九日乘之，為實。實如法得一錢。
荅曰： a錢 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the interest for borrowing 750 coins for 9 days, given that the monthly interest rate is 30 coins for 1000 coins. Here's the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
monthly_interest = 30  # interest for 1000 coins in a month
loan_amount = 750  # amount borrowed
loan_days = 9  # duration of the loan in days
days_in_month = 30  # number of days in a month
base_amount = 1000  # base amount for interest calculation

# Calculation
a = Fraction(monthly_interest, days_in_month) * Fraction(loan_amount, base_amount) * loan_days

# Result
a  # The interest in coins
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the interest in coins as a fraction.
