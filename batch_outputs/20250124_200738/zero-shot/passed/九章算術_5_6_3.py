To solve the problem, we will calculate the volume of the ditch (溝積) and then determine the number of workers (徒人) required based on the given conditions.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given dimensions of the ditch
top_width = Fraction(1, 1) * 15  # 1丈5尺 = 15尺
bottom_width = Fraction(1, 1) * 10  # 1丈 = 10尺
depth = Fraction(1, 1) * 5  # 5尺
length = Fraction(1, 1) * 70  # 7丈 = 70尺

# Calculate the volume of the ditch (trapezoidal prism)
# Volume = (1/2) * (top_width + bottom_width) * depth * length
volume = Fraction(1, 2) * (top_width + bottom_width) * depth * length

# Given worker's efficiency
worker_efficiency = Fraction(766, 1)  # 766尺
# Including the additional 1/5 of the worker's efficiency for removing soil
adjusted_efficiency = worker_efficiency * Fraction(4, 5)  # Remove 1/5

# Calculate the number of workers required
# Number of workers = volume / adjusted_efficiency
a = volume / adjusted_efficiency

# Print the result
a

"""


### Explanation:
1. **Volume Calculation**: The ditch is a trapezoidal prism, so its volume is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Top Width} + \text{Bottom Width}) \times \text{Depth} \times \text{Length}
   \]

2. **Worker Efficiency Adjustment**: Each worker's efficiency is reduced by \( \frac{1}{5} \) due to the additional effort of removing soil.

3. **Number of Workers**: The total number of workers required is the volume divided by the adjusted efficiency.

### Final Answer:
The variable `a` will contain the number of workers required.
