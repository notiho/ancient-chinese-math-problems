有山居木西，不知其高。山去木五十三里，木高九丈五尺。人立木東三里，望木末適與山峰斜平。人目高七尺。問︰山高幾何？
術曰：置木高減人目高七尺，餘，以乘五十三里為實。以人去木三里為法。實如法而一，所得，加木高即山高。
荅曰： a丈 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the height of a mountain based on the given distances and heights. Here's the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
wood_height = Fraction(9 * 10 + 5, 10)  # 9丈5尺 converted to 丈
eye_height = Fraction(7, 10)  # 7尺 converted to 丈
distance_mountain_to_wood = Fraction(53)  # 53里
distance_person_to_wood = Fraction(3)  # 3里

# Step 1: Subtract the eye height from the wood height
adjusted_wood_height = wood_height - eye_height

# Step 2: Multiply the adjusted wood height by the distance from the mountain to the wood
product = adjusted_wood_height * distance_mountain_to_wood

# Step 3: Divide the product by the distance from the person to the wood
quotient = product / distance_person_to_wood

# Step 4: Add the wood height to the quotient to get the mountain height
a = quotient + wood_height

# The height of the mountain (a) is now stored in the variable `a` in 丈
a
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the height of the mountain in 丈 as a `Fraction`.
