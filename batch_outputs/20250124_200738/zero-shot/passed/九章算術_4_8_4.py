今有田廣一步半、三分步之一、四分步之一、五分步之一、六分步之一、七分步之一、八分步之一、九分步之一、十分步之一。求田一畝，問︰從幾何？
術曰：下有一十分，以一為二千五百二十，半為一千二百六十，三分之一為八百四十，四分之一為六百三十，五分之一為五百四，六分之一為四百二十，七分之一為三百六十，八分之一為三百一十五，九分之一為二百八十，十分之一為二百五十二，并之得七千三百八十一，以為法。置田二百四十步，亦以一為二千五百二十乘之，為實。實如法得從步。
荅曰： a步 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the number of steps (`a`) required to cover a field area of 240 steps, given the contributions of various fractions of a step.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the contributions of each fraction of a step
one = 2520  # 1 step = 2520 units
half = 1260  # 1/2 step = 1260 units
third = 840  # 1/3 step = 840 units
quarter = 630  # 1/4 step = 630 units
fifth = 504  # 1/5 step = 504 units
sixth = 420  # 1/6 step = 420 units
seventh = 360  # 1/7 step = 360 units
eighth = 315  # 1/8 step = 315 units
ninth = 280  # 1/9 step = 280 units
tenth = 252  # 1/10 step = 252 units

# Sum up all the contributions to get the total "法" (law or standard)
law = one + half + third + quarter + fifth + sixth + seventh + eighth + ninth + tenth

# The given field area is 240 steps
field_area = 240

# Calculate the total units for the field area
total_units = field_area * one

# Solve for the number of steps (a)
a = Fraction(total_units, law)

# Output the result
a

"""


### Explanation:
1. Each fraction of a step is converted into its corresponding unit value.
2. The total "法" (law) is the sum of all these unit values.
3. The field area of 240 steps is converted into units by multiplying it by the unit value of 1 step.
4. The number of steps (`a`) is calculated by dividing the total units by the "法."
5. The result is stored in the variable `a` as a `Fraction`.

### Solution:
The value of `a` will be the number of steps required to cover the field area.
