今有器中米，不知其數，前人取半，中人三分取一，後人四分取一，餘米一斗五升。問：米幾何？
術曰：置餘米一斗五升，以六乘之，得九斗；以二除之，得四斗五升；以四乘之，得一斛八斗；以三除之，即得。
答曰： a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The unknown quantity of rice is represented as "a". We will compute its value step by step as described in the problem.


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given: Remaining rice = 1斗5升
remaining_rice = Fraction(1, 1) + Fraction(5, 10)  # 1斗5升 = 1斗 + 5升 (1升 = 1/10斗)

# Step 1: Multiply the remaining rice by 6
step1 = remaining_rice * 6  # 得九斗

# Step 2: Divide the result by 2
step2 = step1 / 2  # 得四斗五升

# Step 3: Multiply the result by 4
step3 = step2 * 4  # 得一斛八斗 (1斛 = 10斗)

# Step 4: Divide the result by 3 to find the total amount of rice
a = step3 / 3  # 即得

# The total amount of rice is stored in variable "a"
print(f"a = {a}斗")

### Explanation of Units:
- 1斗 = 10升
- Remaining rice is given as 1斗5升, which is converted to `1 + 5/10 = 1.5斗`.
- The operations follow the steps described in the problem.

### Output:
The variable `a` will contain the total amount of rice in 斗.
