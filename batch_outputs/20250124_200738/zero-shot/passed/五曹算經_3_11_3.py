又有席，一領坐客一十五人，有客四萬四千六百二十五人。問：席㡬何？
術曰：列四萬四千六百二十五人，以一十五人除之即得。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many "seats" (席) are required if each seat accommodates 15 people and there are 44,625 people in total. Here's the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_people = 44625
people_per_seat = 15

# Calculate the number of seats
a = total_people // people_per_seat  # Integer division since seats must be whole

# Result
a  # This represents the number of seats (席)
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will store the number of seats required.
