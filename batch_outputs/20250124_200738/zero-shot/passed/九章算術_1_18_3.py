乘分術曰：母相乘為法，子相乘為實，實如法而一。
荅曰： a步 。

To solve this problem, we will calculate the area of the field in terms of "步" (a unit of measurement). The problem involves multiplying two fractions: \( \frac{4}{7} \) and \( \frac{3}{5} \). The solution is given as \( a \) in the answer.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given fractions
fraction1 = Fraction(4, 7)  # 4/7
fraction2 = Fraction(3, 5)  # 3/5

# Multiply the fractions
a = fraction1 * fraction2  # a = (4/7) * (3/5)

# The result is stored in variable 'a'
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The value of \( a \) will be the area of the field in "步".
