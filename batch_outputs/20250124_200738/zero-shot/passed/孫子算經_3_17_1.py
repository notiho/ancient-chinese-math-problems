今有器中米，不知其數，前人取半，中人三分取一，後人四分取一，餘米一斗五升。問：米幾何？
術曰：置餘米一斗五升，以六乘之，得九斗；以二除之，得四斗五升；以四乘之，得一斛八斗；以三除之，即得。
答曰： a斗 。

"""
To solve this problem, let's translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves fractions and units of measurement (斗 and 升). We'll use the `Fraction` class to handle the fractional calculations.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Remaining rice after all people took their portions
remaining_rice = Fraction(1, 1) * 1 + Fraction(5, 10)  # 1斗5升 = 1斗 + 5升 (10升 = 1斗)

# Step 1: Multiply the remaining rice by 6
step1 = remaining_rice * 6  # 得九斗

# Step 2: Divide the result by 2
step2 = step1 / 2  # 得四斗五升

# Step 3: Multiply the result by 4
step3 = step2 * 4  # 得一斛八斗 (1斛 = 10斗)

# Step 4: Divide the result by 3
a = step3 / 3  # 即得

# The total amount of rice is stored in variable 'a'
print(f"a = {a}斗")
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. The remaining rice is given as `1斗5升`. Since `10升 = 1斗`, we convert this to `1 + 5/10 = 1 + 1/2 = Fraction(3, 2)`斗.
2. Multiply the remaining rice by 6.
3. Divide the result by 2.
4. Multiply the result by 4.
5. Divide the result by 3 to find the total amount of rice (`a`).

### Output:
The variable `a` will contain the total amount of rice in `斗`.
