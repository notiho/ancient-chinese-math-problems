To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of characters in the book. The problem states that there are 29 chapters, and each chapter contains 63 characters. The total number of characters is obtained by multiplying the number of chapters by the number of characters per chapter.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
chapters = 29  # Number of chapters
characters_per_chapter = 63  # Characters per chapter

# Calculation
a = chapters * characters_per_chapter

# Result
a
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will store the total number of characters in the book.
