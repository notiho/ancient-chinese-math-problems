今有粟一十二萬八千九百四十斛九斗三合，出與人買絹一匹，直粟三斛五斗七升。問：絹幾何？
術曰：置粟一十二萬八千九百四十斛九斗三合為實，以三斛五斗七升為法，除之，得匹餘四十之所得，又以法除之，即得。
答曰： a匹 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many pieces of silk ("絹") can be bought with the given amount of grain ("粟"). The total amount of grain is 128,940斛9斗3合, and the price of one piece of silk is 3斛5斗7升. We will use the class `Fraction` to handle the calculations.

### Units Conversion:
1 斛 = 10 斗  
1 斗 = 10 升  
1 升 = 10 合  

Thus, the total amount of grain and the price per piece of silk must be converted into the smallest unit, 合, for accurate calculations.

### Python Code:

"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Convert total grain to 合
total_grain = 128940 * 1000 + 9 * 100 + 3  # 128,940斛9斗3合

# Convert price per piece of silk to 合
price_per_silk = 3 * 1000 + 5 * 100 + 7 * 10  # 3斛5斗7升

# Calculate the number of silk pieces
a = Fraction(total_grain, price_per_silk)

# Output the result
a  # This is the number of silk pieces
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
- `total_grain` is the total amount of grain converted into 合.
- `price_per_silk` is the price of one piece of silk converted into 合.
- `a` is the number of silk pieces, calculated by dividing `total_grain` by `price_per_silk`.

The variable `a` will contain the exact number of silk pieces as a `Fraction`.
