今有鳧起南海，七日至北海；鴈起北海，九日至南海。今鳧鴈俱起。問︰何日相逢？
術曰：并日數為法，日數相乘為實，實如法得一日。
荅曰： a日 。

This problem involves determining the number of days it takes for a duck (鳧) and a goose (鴈) traveling towards each other to meet. The duck takes 7 days to travel from the South Sea to the North Sea, and the goose takes 9 days to travel from the North Sea to the South Sea. Both start at the same time.

The solution involves finding the time it takes for them to meet, which is calculated as follows:

1. Add the total days it takes for both to complete their journeys (7 + 9).
2. Multiply the days it takes for each to complete their journey (7 * 9).
3. Divide the product of their journey days by the sum of their journey days to find the meeting time.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Days it takes for the duck and goose to complete their journeys
duck_days = 7
goose_days = 9

# Calculate the meeting time
a = Fraction(duck_days * goose_days, duck_days + goose_days)

# The result is stored in variable "a"
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will hold the value of the meeting time in days as a `Fraction`.
