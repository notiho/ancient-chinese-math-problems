To solve this problem, we need to compute the area of the field based on the given fractions. The problem states that the field's dimensions are \( \frac{4}{5} \) of a step in width and \( \frac{5}{9} \) of a step in length. The area is calculated by multiplying these two fractions.

Here is the Python code to compute the value of \( a \):


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Dimensions of the field
width = Fraction(4, 5)  # 4/5 of a step
length = Fraction(5, 9)  # 5/9 of a step

# Calculate the area
a = width * length  # Area in square steps

# The result is stored in variable 'a'
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The value of \( a \) will represent the area of the field in square steps.
