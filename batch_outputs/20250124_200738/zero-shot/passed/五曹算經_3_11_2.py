又有席，一領坐客一十五人，有客四萬四千六百二十五人。問：席㡬何？
術曰：列四萬四千六百二十五人，以一十五人除之即得。
答曰： a領 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of席 (seats) required to accommodate 44,625 guests, where each席 can seat 15 people. Here's the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_guests = 44625  # Total number of guests
guests_per_seat = 15  # Number of guests per seat

# Calculation
a = Fraction(total_guests, guests_per_seat)

# Result
a  # Number of seats required
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will hold the result, representing the number of席 (seats) required.
