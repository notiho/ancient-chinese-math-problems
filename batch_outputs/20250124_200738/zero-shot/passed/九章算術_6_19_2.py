今有鳧起南海，七日至北海；鴈起北海，九日至南海。今鳧鴈俱起。問︰何日相逢？
術曰：并日數為法，日數相乘為實，實如法得一日。
荅曰： a日 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves two birds, a duck ("鳧") and a goose ("鴈"), traveling between the South Sea and the North Sea. The duck takes 7 days to travel from the South Sea to the North Sea, while the goose takes 9 days to travel from the North Sea to the South Sea. We are tasked with finding the number of days it will take for the two birds to meet if they start traveling simultaneously.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Days it takes for the duck and goose to complete their journeys
duck_days = 7  # Duck takes 7 days
goose_days = 9  # Goose takes 9 days

# Formula: (duck_days * goose_days) / (duck_days + goose_days)
a = Fraction(duck_days * goose_days, duck_days + goose_days)

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'
a  # This represents the number of days until they meet
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The solution for `a` will be in days, represented as a fraction.
