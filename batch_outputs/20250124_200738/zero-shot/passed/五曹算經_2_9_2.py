"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total area occupied by 23,900 carriages, where each carriage occupies 3 steps of land. The solution is straightforward multiplication.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
carriages = 23900  # Number of carriages
steps_per_carriage = 3  # Steps occupied by each carriage

# Calculation
a = carriages * steps_per_carriage  # Total steps occupied

# Result
a  # This will hold the total steps
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the total steps occupied by the carriages.
