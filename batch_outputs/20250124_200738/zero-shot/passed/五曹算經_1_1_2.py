今有方田廣從各六十八步。問：為田㡬何？
術曰：列田六十八步自相乘得四千六百二十四步以畝法除之即得。
答曰： a畝 奇 b步 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of a square field where each side is 68 steps long. The area is given in terms of "畝" (a traditional Chinese unit of area) and "步" (steps). The conversion is not explicitly provided, but traditionally, 1 畝 = 240 步².

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
side_length = 68  # in steps
conversion_factor = 240  # 1 畝 = 240 步²

# Calculate the area in 步²
total_area = side_length * side_length  # 步²

# Convert the area into 畝 and 步
a = total_area // conversion_factor  # Integer part in 畝
b = total_area % conversion_factor  # Remainder in 步

# Results
a = Fraction(a)  # 畝
b = Fraction(b)  # 步
#----- content ends here -----


"""


After running this code, the values of `a` (畝) and `b` (步) will represent the solution.
