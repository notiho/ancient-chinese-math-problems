今有蛇田頭廣三十三步胷廣五十七步尾廣十八步從九十二步。問：為田㡬何？
術曰：并三廣得一百八步以三除之得三十六步以從九十二步乘之得三千三百一十二步以畝法除之即得。
答曰： a畝 奇 b步 。

This problem involves calculating the area of an irregularly shaped field (a trapezoid-like shape) and converting the result into a combination of "畝" (Chinese unit of area) and "步" (smaller unit of area). Here's the Python code to solve it:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given dimensions
head_width = 33  # 頭廣 (步)
middle_width = 57  # 胷廣 (步)
tail_width = 18  # 尾廣 (步)
length = 92  # 從 (步)

# Step 1: Calculate the average width
total_width = head_width + middle_width + tail_width  # 并三廣
average_width = Fraction(total_width, 3)  # 以三除之

# Step 2: Calculate the total area in square 步
total_area = average_width * length  # 以從九十二步乘之

# Step 3: Convert the area into 畝 and 步
# 1 畝 = 240 步
mu = total_area // 240  # 畝
remaining_bu = total_area % 240  # 步

# Assign the results to variables
a = mu
b = remaining_bu

# The solution:
# a represents the number of 畝
# b represents the remaining 步
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Average Width Calculation**: The average width is calculated by summing the three widths (head, middle, tail) and dividing by 3.
2. **Total Area Calculation**: The area is calculated by multiplying the average width by the length of the field.
3. **Conversion to 畝 and 步**: Since 1 畝 = 240 步, the total area in square 步 is divided by 240 to get the number of 畝, and the remainder is the remaining 步.

### Final Answer:
The variables `a` and `b` contain the solution:
- `a` is the number of 畝.
- `b` is the number of 步.
