今有方田廣從各六十八步。問：為田㡬何？
術曰：列田六十八步自相乘得四千六百二十四步以畝法除之即得。
答曰： a畝 奇 b步 。

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the area of a square field where each side is 68 steps long. The area is then converted into "畝" (a traditional Chinese unit of area) and "步" (a smaller unit of area). 

The conversion rule is not explicitly provided in the problem, but traditionally, 1 畝 = 240 步. We will use this conversion.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
side_length = 68  # in steps
conversion_rate = 240  # 1 畝 = 240 步

# Step 1: Calculate the total area in steps
total_area = side_length * side_length  # in steps^2

# Step 2: Convert the total area into 畝 and 步
a = total_area // conversion_rate  # full 畝
b = total_area % conversion_rate  # remaining 步

# Results
a, b
#----- content ends here -----


"""


This will compute the values of `a` (畝) and `b` (步).
