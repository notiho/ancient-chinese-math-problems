今有一人一日矯矢五十，一人一日羽矢三十，一人一日筈矢十五。今令一人一日自矯、羽、筈，問︰成矢幾何？
術曰：矯矢五十，用徒一人。羽矢五十，用徒一人、太半人。筈矢五十，用徒三人、少半人。并之，得六人，以為法。以五十矢為實。實如法得一矢。
荅曰： a矢 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating how many arrows ("矢") one person can complete in one day when performing all tasks (矯, 羽, 筈) by themselves. Here's the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the rates for each task
矯_rate = 50  #矯矢 rate: 50 arrows per person per day
羽_rate = 30  #羽矢 rate: 30 arrows per person per day
筈_rate = 15  #筈矢 rate: 15 arrows per person per day

# Calculate the number of people required to complete 50 arrows for each task
矯_people = Fraction(50, 矯_rate)  # People needed for 矯矢
羽_people = Fraction(50, 羽_rate)  # People needed for 羽矢
筈_people = Fraction(50, 筈_rate)  # People needed for 筈矢

# Total people required to complete 50 arrows
total_people = 矯_people + 羽_people + 筈_people

# Calculate how many arrows one person can complete in one day
a = Fraction(50, total_people)

# The result
a  # This is the number of arrows one person can complete in one day
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` represents the number of arrows one person can complete in one day.
