"""
To solve this problem, we calculate the total area occupied by the vehicles. Each vehicle occupies 3 steps of land, and there are 23,900 vehicles. The answer is represented by `a`.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
vehicles = 23900  # Number of vehicles
area_per_vehicle = 3  # Area occupied by each vehicle in steps

# Calculation
a = vehicles * area_per_vehicle  # Total area in steps

# Result
a  # This will hold the total area in steps
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the total area in steps.
