今有方田廣從各六十八步。問：為田㡬何？
術曰：列田六十八步自相乘得四千六百二十四步以畝法除之即得。
答曰： a畝 奇 b步 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of a square field where each side is 68 steps long. The area is then converted into "畝" (a traditional Chinese unit of area) and "步" (a smaller unit of area). 

1 畝 = 240 步.

Here is the Python code to compute the values of `a` (畝) and `b` (步):


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
side_length = 68  # steps
steps_per_mu = 240  # 1 畝 = 240 步

# Calculate the total area in 步
total_area = side_length * side_length  # area in 步

# Convert the area into 畝 and 步
a = total_area // steps_per_mu  # whole 畝
b = total_area % steps_per_mu  # remaining 步

# Results
a, b
#----- content ends here -----


"""


After running the code:
- `a` will represent the number of 畝.
- `b` will represent the remaining 步.
