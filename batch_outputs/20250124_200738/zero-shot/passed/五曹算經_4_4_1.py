To solve this problem, we will calculate the volume of a cylinder (圓囷) and then convert it into the number of "斛" and remaining "尺" using the given method.

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:

\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]

However, in ancient Chinese mathematics, \(\pi\) was approximated as 3, so the formula simplifies to:

\[
V = 3 \cdot r^2 \cdot h
\]

The problem states:
- The circumference (周) is 3 丈.
- The height (高) is 1 丈 6 尺.
- 1 丈 = 10 尺.

From the circumference, we can calculate the radius \(r\) using the formula \(C = 2 \pi r\), where \(\pi\) is approximated as 3.

Finally, the volume is divided by 12 to convert cubic 尺 into "斛". Each "斛" is equivalent to 1 尺 6 寸 2 分, which is \(1 + \frac{6}{10} + \frac{2}{100} = \frac{81}{50}\) cubic 尺.

Here is the Python code to compute the answer:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
circumference = 3 * 10  # 3 丈 = 30 尺
height = 1 * 10 + 6  # 1 丈 6 尺 = 16 尺

# Step 1: Calculate the radius
pi = 3
radius = Fraction(circumference, 2 * pi)  # r = C / (2 * pi)

# Step 2: Calculate the volume of the cylinder
volume = pi * radius**2 * height  # V = 3 * r^2 * h

# Step 3: Convert the volume to "斛" and remaining "尺"
volume_in_cubic_chi = volume // 12  # Divide by 12 to get "斛"
remaining_cubic_chi = volume % 12  # Remainder in cubic 尺

# Step 4: Convert remaining cubic 尺 to "斛" and "尺"
chi_per_hu = Fraction(81, 50)  # 1 斛 = 1 尺 6 寸 2 分 = 81/50 cubic 尺
a = volume_in_cubic_chi  # Number of "斛"
b = remaining_cubic_chi  # Remaining 尺

# Final result
a = int(volume // chi_per_hu)  # Number of "斛"
b = volume % chi_per_hu
