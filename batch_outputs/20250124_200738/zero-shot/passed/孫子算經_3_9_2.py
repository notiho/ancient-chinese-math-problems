今有粟，三千九百九十九斛九斗六升，凡粟九斗易豆一斛。問：計豆幾何？
術曰：置粟三千九百九十九斛九斗六升為實，以九斗為法。實如法，即得。
答曰： a斛 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many "豆" (a unit of measure) can be obtained from a given amount of "粟" (grain) when 9 斗 (another unit of measure) of 粟 can be exchanged for 1 斛 of 豆.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The total amount of 粟 is given as 3999 斛 9 斗 6 升.
2. The exchange rate is 9 斗 of 粟 for 1 斛 of 豆.
3. We need to compute how many 豆 (斛) can be obtained.

### Conversion:
- 1 斛 = 10 斗
- 1 斗 = 10 升

Thus, the total amount of 粟 in terms of 升 is:
\[ \text{Total 粟 in 升} = (3999 \times 10 \times 10) + (9 \times 10) + 6 \]

Next, we calculate how many 豆 (斛) can be obtained by dividing the total 粟 (in 升) by the equivalent of 9 斗 (in 升):
\[ \text{豆 (斛)} = \frac{\text{Total 粟 in 升}}{\text{9 斗 in 升}} \]

### Python Code:

"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total 粟 in 升
total_corn_in_sheng = (3999 * 10 * 10) + (9 * 10) + 6

# 9 斗 in 升
nine_dou_in_sheng = 9 * 10

# Calculate 豆 (斛)
a = Fraction(total_corn_in_sheng, nine_dou_in_sheng)

# Result
a  # This represents the number of 豆 (斛)
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. We first convert the total amount of 粟 into 升.
2. We calculate the equivalent of 9 斗 in 升.
3. We divide the total 粟 (in 升) by the 升 equivalent of 9 斗 to find the number of 豆 (斛).
4. The result is stored in the variable `a`.

### Final Answer:
The variable `a` contains the number of 豆 (斛) as a fraction.
