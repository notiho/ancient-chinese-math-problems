今有方窖，廣四丈六尺，長五丈四尺，深三丈五尺。問：受粟幾何？
術曰：置廣四丈六尺，長五丈四尺，相乘得二千四百八十四尺；以深三丈五尺乘之，得八萬六千九百四十尺，以斛法一尺六寸二分除之，即得。
答曰： a斛 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of a rectangular pit (方窖) and then convert it into a unit of measurement called "斛" using the given conversion factor.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The dimensions of the pit are:
   - Width: 4丈6尺 = 4 * 10 + 6 = 46尺
   - Length: 5丈4尺 = 5 * 10 + 4 = 54尺
   - Depth: 3丈5尺 = 3 * 10 + 5 = 35尺

2. The volume in cubic 尺 is calculated as:
   Volume = Width × Length × Depth

3. The conversion factor is given as 1斛 = 1尺6寸2分 = 1 + 6/10 + 2/100 = 1.62 cubic 尺.

4. To find the number of 斛, divide the total volume by 1.62.

### Python Code:

"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Dimensions in 尺
width = 4 * 10 + 6  # 4丈6尺 = 46尺
length = 5 * 10 + 4  # 5丈4尺 = 54尺
depth = 3 * 10 + 5  # 3丈5尺 = 35尺

# Volume in cubic 尺
volume = width * length * depth  # Volume = Width × Length × Depth

# Conversion factor: 1斛 = 1.62 cubic 尺
conversion_factor = Fraction(162, 100)  # 1.62 as a fraction

# Calculate the number of 斛
a = volume / conversion_factor  # a = Volume / Conversion Factor

# Result
a
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation of the Code:
- The dimensions are converted from 丈 and 尺 into 尺.
- The volume is calculated by multiplying the width, length, and depth.
- The conversion factor is represented as a fraction (1.62 = 162/100) to ensure precise calculations.
- The total volume is divided by the conversion factor to compute the number of 斛.

### Final Answer:
The variable `a` will contain the number of 斛 as a `Fraction`.
