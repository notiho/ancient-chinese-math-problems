今有器中米，不知其數，前人取半，中人三分取一，後人四分取一，餘米一斗五升。問：米幾何？
術曰：置餘米一斗五升，以六乘之，得九斗；以二除之，得四斗五升；以四乘之，得一斛八斗；以三除之，即得。
答曰： a斗 。

To solve this problem, let's translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. We'll use the `Fraction` class to handle the calculations.

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Remaining rice after all people took their shares
remaining_rice = Fraction(1, 10) * 15  # 1斗5升 = 1.5斗 = 15升 (1斗 = 10升)

# Step 1: Multiply the remaining rice by 6
step1 = remaining_rice * 6  # 得九斗

# Step 2: Divide the result by 2
step2 = step1 / 2  # 得四斗五升 = 4.5斗

# Step 3: Multiply the result by 4
step3 = step2 * 4  # 得一斛八斗 = 18斗 (1斛 = 10斗)

# Step 4: Divide the result by 3 to get the total amount of rice

The variable `a斗` will contain the total amount of rice in the container in units of 斗.
