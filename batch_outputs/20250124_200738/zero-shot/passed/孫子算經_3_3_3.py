To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of characters in the book. The book has 29 chapters, and each chapter contains 63 characters. The solution is straightforward: multiply the number of chapters by the number of characters per chapter.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
chapters = 29
characters_per_chapter = 63

# Calculation
a = chapters * characters_per_chapter

# Result
a
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The value of `a` will be the total number of characters in the book.
