今有絲一斤價直三百四十五。今有絲七兩一十二銖，問︰得錢幾何？
術曰：以一斤銖數為法，以一斤價數，乘七兩一十二銖為實。實如法得錢數。
荅曰： a錢 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of 7 taels (兩) and 12 zhu (銖) of silk, given that 1 jin (斤) of silk costs 345 qian (錢). 

1 jin = 16 taels, and 1 tael = 24 zhu. Therefore, 1 jin = 16 * 24 = 384 zhu.

The formula provided in the problem is:
- Use the total number of zhu in 1 jin as the divisor (法).
- Multiply the price of 1 jin (345 qian) by the total number of zhu in 7 taels and 12 zhu to get the dividend (實).
- Divide the dividend by the divisor to get the answer.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
price_per_jin = 345  # in qian
zhu_per_jin = 16 * 24  # 1 jin = 16 taels, 1 tael = 24 zhu
taels = 7
zhu = 12

# Convert 7 taels and 12 zhu to total zhu
total_zhu = taels * 24 + zhu

# Calculate the value in qian
a = Fraction(price_per_jin * total_zhu, zhu_per_jin)

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'
a
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the value in qian (錢).
