To solve the problem, we need to determine how many seats ("a") are required if each seat accommodates 15 people and there are 44,625 people in total.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total number of people
total_people = 44625

# Number of people per seat
people_per_seat = 15

# Calculate the number of seats required
a = Fraction(total_people, people_per_seat)

# The result is stored in variable 'a'
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the number of seats required.
