"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice (in "斛") owed by 2,700 households, where each household owes 15斛. Here's the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
households = 2700  # Number of households
rent_per_household = 15  # Rent in 斛 per household

# Calculation
a = households * rent_per_household  # Total rent in 斛

# Result
a  # Total rent in 斛
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The value of `a` will be the total rent in 斛.
