今有方田廣從各六十八步。問：為田㡬何？
術曰：列田六十八步自相乘得四千六百二十四步以畝法除之即得。
答曰： a畝 奇 b步 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to compute the area of a square field where each side is 68 steps long. The area is then converted into "畝" (mu) and remaining "步" (steps). 

1 畝 = 240 步.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
side_length = 68  # steps
steps_per_mu = 240  # steps in 1 畝

# Calculate the total area in steps
total_area_steps = side_length * side_length

# Convert the area into 畝 and remaining 步
a = total_area_steps // steps_per_mu  # full 畝
b = total_area_steps % steps_per_mu  # remaining 步

# Results
a, b
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variables `a` and `b` will contain the solution:
- `a` is the number of 畝.
- `b` is the remaining number of 步.
