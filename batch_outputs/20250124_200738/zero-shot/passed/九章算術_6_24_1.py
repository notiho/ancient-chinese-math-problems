今有程耕，一人一日發七畝，一人一日耕三畝，一人一日耰種五畝。今令一人一日自發、耕、耰種之，問︰治田幾何？
術曰：置發、耕、耰畝數，令互乘人數，并以為法。畝數相乘為實。實如法得一畝。
荅曰： a畝 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves determining how much land (in 畝) one person can manage in a single day when performing all three tasks: 發 (7 畝/day), 耕 (3 畝/day), and 耰種 (5 畝/day). The solution involves finding the harmonic mean of these rates.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Rates of work for each task (in 畝/day)
rate_fa = 7  # 發
rate_geng = 3  # 耕
rate_you = 5  # 耰種

# Compute the total land managed in one day by one person
a = Fraction(1, Fraction(1, rate_fa) + Fraction(1, rate_geng) + Fraction(1, rate_you))

# The result is stored in variable 'a'
a  # This represents the total land (in 畝) managed in one day
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the solution in 畝.
