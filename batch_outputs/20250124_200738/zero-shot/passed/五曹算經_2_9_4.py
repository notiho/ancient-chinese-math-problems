"""
To solve this problem, we calculate the total area occupied by 23,900 carriages, where each carriage occupies 3 steps of land. Here's the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
carriages = 23900  # number of carriages
steps_per_carriage = 3  # steps occupied by each carriage

# Calculation
a = carriages * steps_per_carriage  # total steps occupied

# Result
a  # a is the total number of steps
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The solution is stored in the variable `a`, which represents the total steps occupied.
