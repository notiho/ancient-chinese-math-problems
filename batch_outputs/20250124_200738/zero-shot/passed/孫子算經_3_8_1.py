今有綿，九萬一千一百三十五觔，給與三萬六千四百五十四戶。問：戶得幾何？
術曰：置九萬一千一百三十五觔，為實；以三萬六千四百五十四戶，為法。除之，得二觔，不盡一萬八千二百二十七觔，以一十六乘之，得二十九萬一千六百三十二兩，以戶除之，即得。
答曰： a觔 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much weight (in "觔") each household receives when 91,135 "觔" of material is distributed among 36,454 households. Additionally, the remainder is converted into "兩" (1 "觔" = 16 "兩") and distributed among the households.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_weight = 91135  # in 觔
households = 36454

# Calculate the weight per household in 觔
a = total_weight // households  # Integer division to get the whole number of 觔
remainder_weight = total_weight % households  # Remaining weight in 觔

# Convert the remainder into 兩 and distribute among households
remainder_liang = remainder_weight * 16  # Convert 觔 to 兩
liang_per_household = Fraction(remainder_liang, households)  # Fraction of 兩 per household

# Final result
a = Fraction(a) + liang_per_household / 16  # Combine 觔 and 兩 into a single value in 觔

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'
a
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of weight (in "觔") each household receives, represented as a fraction.
