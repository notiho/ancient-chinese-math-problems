今有一人一日為牡瓦三十八枚，一人一日為牝瓦七十六枚。今令一人一日作瓦，牝、牡相半，問︰成瓦幾何？
術曰：并牝、牡為法，牝牡相乘為實，實如法得一枚。
荅曰： a枚 。

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tiles (瓦) one person can make in a day when the number of male tiles (牡瓦) and female tiles (牝瓦) produced is equal (牝、牡相半). Here's the Python code to compute the value of `a`:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
male_tiles_per_day = 38  # 牡瓦 per day
female_tiles_per_day = 76  # 牝瓦 per day

# Compute the total tiles produced in one day when male and female tiles are equal
total_tiles_per_day = male_tiles_per_day + female_tiles_per_day  # 并牝、牡為法
product_of_tiles = male_tiles_per_day * female_tiles_per_day  # 牝牡相乘為實

# The number of tiles produced per day when male and female tiles are equal
a = Fraction(product_of_tiles, total_tiles_per_day)  # 實如法得一枚

# Result
a  # a枚

"""


The value of `a` will be the number of tiles produced per day when male and female tiles are equal.
