今有鳧起南海，七日至北海；鴈起北海，九日至南海。今鳧鴈俱起。問︰何日相逢？
術曰：并日數為法，日數相乘為實，實如法得一日。
荅曰： a日 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of days it takes for the two birds (鳧 and 鴈) to meet when they start traveling towards each other. The problem states that the 鳧 takes 7 days to travel from the South Sea to the North Sea, and the 鴈 takes 9 days to travel from the North Sea to the South Sea. 

The solution involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of their travel times divided by the sum of their travel times.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
days_feng = 7  # 鳧 takes 7 days
days_yan = 9   # 鴈 takes 9 days

# Compute the meeting day
a = Fraction(days_feng * days_yan, days_feng + days_yan)

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the number of days it takes for the two birds to meet.
