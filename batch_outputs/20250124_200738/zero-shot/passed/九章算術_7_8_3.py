今有米在十斗桶中，不知其數。滿中添粟而舂之，得米七斗。問︰故米幾何？
術曰：以盈不足術求之，假令故米二斗，不足二升。令之三斗，有餘二升。
盈不足術曰：置所出率，盈、不足各居其下。令維乘所出率，并以為實。并盈、不足為法。實如法而一。有分者，通之。盈不足相與同其買物者，置所出率，以少減多，餘，以約法、實。實為物價，法為人數。
荅曰： a斗 。

To solve this problem, we will use the "盈不足術" (Excess and Deficiency Method). Here's the Python code to compute the value of the unknown "a" (the amount of rice in the bucket initially):


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data:
# Hypothesis 1: If the initial rice is 2斗, it is short by 2升.
# Hypothesis 2: If the initial rice is 3斗, it exceeds by 2升.

# Convert everything to the same unit (升), since 1斗 = 10升:
# Hypothesis 1: 2斗 = 20升, short by 2升 -> Actual = 20升 - 2升 = 18升
# Hypothesis 2: 3斗 = 30升, exceeds by 2升 -> Actual = 30升 + 2升 = 32升

# Excess and Deficiency Method:
# Difference between the two hypotheses = 3斗 - 2斗 = 1斗 = 10升
# Difference in results = 32升 - 18升 = 14升

# Calculate the initial amount of rice (a):
a = Fraction(20 * 2 + 30 * 2, 2 + 2)  # Using the formula from the method

# Convert back to 斗:
a = a / 10  # Convert from 升 to 斗

# The result:
a  # This is the initial amount of rice in 斗

"""


The variable `a` will contain the solution in terms of `Fraction`, representing the initial amount of rice in the bucket in 斗.
