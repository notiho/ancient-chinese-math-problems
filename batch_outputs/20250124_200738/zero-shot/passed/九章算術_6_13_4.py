今有兔先走一百步，犬追之二百五十步，不及三十步而止。問︰犬不止，復行幾何步及之？
術曰：置兔先走一百步，以犬走不及三十步減之，餘為法。以不及三十步乘犬追步數為實，實如法得一步。
荅曰： a步 。

To solve this problem, let's translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves determining how many additional steps the dog (犬) would need to take to catch up with the rabbit (兔). Here's the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
rabbit_initial_steps = 100  # Rabbit initially walks 100 steps
dog_steps = 250  # Dog walks 250 steps
dog_falls_short = 30  # Dog falls short by 30 steps

# Calculation
a = Fraction(dog_falls_short * dog_steps, rabbit_initial_steps - dog_falls_short)

# The result
a  # This is the number of steps the dog needs to take to catch up
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the number of steps the dog needs to take to catch up with the rabbit.
