今有垣高九尺。瓜生其上，蔓日長七寸。瓠生其下，蔓日長一尺。問︰幾何日相逢？瓜、瓠各長幾何？
術曰：假令五日，不足五寸。令之六日，有餘一尺二寸。
荅曰： a日 。瓜長 b尺 ，瓠長 c尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. Here's the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
wall_height = 9  # in 尺
melon_vine_growth = Fraction(7, 10)  # 7寸 per day, converted to 尺
gourd_vine_growth = 1  # 1尺 per day

# Step 1: Calculate the relative growth per day
relative_growth = melon_vine_growth + gourd_vine_growth  # combined growth of both vines per day

# Step 2: Solve for the number of days (a)
# Let a be the number of days until the vines meet
# After a days, the total growth of the vines must equal the wall height
a = wall_height / relative_growth

# Step 3: Calculate the lengths of the vines
# Length of the melon vine (b) after a days
b = melon_vine_growth * a

# Length of the gourd vine (c) after a days
c = gourd_vine_growth * a

# Results
a, b, c
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. The wall height is 9尺.
2. The melon vine grows 7寸 per day, which is converted to 尺 as \( \frac{7}{10} \)尺.
3. The gourd vine grows 1尺 per day.
4. The relative growth per day is the sum of the growth rates of the melon vine and the gourd vine.
5. The vines meet when their combined growth equals the wall height. Solving for the number of days \( a \), we divide the wall height by the relative growth per day.
6. Using \( a \), we calculate the lengths of the melon vine (\( b \)) and the gourd vine (\( c \)).

### Output:
The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will contain the number of days, the length of the melon vine, and the length of the gourd vine, respectively.
