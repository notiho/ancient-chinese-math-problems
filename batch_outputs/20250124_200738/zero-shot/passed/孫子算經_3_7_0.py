今有絹，七萬八千七百三十二匹，令一百六十二人分之。問：人得幾何？
術曰：置絹七萬八千七百三十二匹為實，以一百六十二人為法。實如法，即得。
答曰： a匹 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of silk pieces (78,732) by the number of people (162). Here's the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total silk pieces
total_silk = 78732

# Number of people
people = 162

# Calculate how much silk each person gets
a = Fraction(total_silk, people)

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The value of `a` will represent the amount of silk (in pieces) each person gets.
