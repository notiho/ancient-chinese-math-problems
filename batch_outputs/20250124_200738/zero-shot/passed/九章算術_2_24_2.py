今有糲米一十九斗二升、七分升之一，欲為粺米。問︰得幾何？
術曰：以糲米求粺米，九之，十而一。
荅曰：為粺米 a斗 。

To solve this problem, we need to convert 糲米 (coarse rice) into 粺米 (polished rice). The rule provided states: "以糲米求粺米，九之，十而一," which means that for every 10 parts of 糲米, you get 9 parts of 粺米.

The given amount of 糲米 is 19斗 (dou), 2升 (sheng), and 1/7升. We will convert this into 粺米 using the given ratio.

Here is the Python code to compute the value of `a` (the amount of 粺米):


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# 糲米 amount in terms of dou
liangmi = 19 + Fraction(2, 10) + Fraction(1, 7 * 10)

# Conversion ratio: 9 parts 粺米 for every 10 parts 糲米
a = liangmi * Fraction(9, 10)

# Result
a  # 粺米 in dou
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the amount of 粺米 in terms of 斗 (dou).
