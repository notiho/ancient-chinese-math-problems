今有丁二萬三千六百九十二人，責兵五千九百二十三人。問：㡬何丁出一兵？
術曰：列二萬三千六百九十二人，以五千九百二十三除之即得。
答曰： a 丁出一兵。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many 丁 (people) are required to provide one 兵 (soldier). Here's the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Total number of people (丁)
total_people = 23692

# Total number of soldiers (兵)
total_soldiers = 5923

# Calculate how many 丁 are required to provide one 兵
a = Fraction(total_people, total_soldiers)

# Result
a  # This represents how many 丁 are required to provide one 兵
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The value of `a` will be the answer, represented as a fraction.
