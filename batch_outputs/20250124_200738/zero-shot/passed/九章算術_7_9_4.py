今有垣高九尺。瓜生其上，蔓日長七寸。瓠生其下，蔓日長一尺。問︰幾何日相逢？瓜、瓠各長幾何？
術曰：假令五日，不足五寸。令之六日，有餘一尺二寸。
荅曰： a日 。瓜長 b尺 ，瓠長 c尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. Here's the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
wall_height = 9  # in 尺
melon_growth_per_day = Fraction(7, 10)  # 7寸 = 7/10尺 per day
gourd_growth_per_day = 1  # 1尺 per day

# Step 1: Find the number of days (a) when the melon and gourd vines meet
# Let a be the number of days
# Distance covered by melon vine in a days = a * melon_growth_per_day
# Distance covered by gourd vine in a days = a * gourd_growth_per_day
# Total distance covered by both vines = wall_height
# a * melon_growth_per_day + a * gourd_growth_per_day = wall_height

a = wall_height / (melon_growth_per_day + gourd_growth_per_day)

# Step 2: Calculate the lengths of the melon vine (b) and gourd vine (c)
b = a * melon_growth_per_day  # Length of melon vine
c = a * gourd_growth_per_day  # Length of gourd vine

# Results
a, b, c
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. The wall height is 9尺.
2. The melon vine grows at a rate of 7寸 per day, which is converted to 7/10尺 per day.
3. The gourd vine grows at a rate of 1尺 per day.
4. The total distance covered by both vines when they meet is equal to the wall height (9尺).
5. We solve for the number of days (a) by dividing the wall height by the combined growth rate of the two vines.
6. Using the number of days (a), we calculate the lengths of the melon vine (b) and gourd vine (c).

### Output:
The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will contain the number of days, the length of the melon vine, and the length of the gourd vine, respectively.
