"""
To solve this problem, we are given 2,700 households, and each household owes 15 hu (斛) of rice as rent. We need to calculate the total amount of rice owed.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
households = 2700  # number of households
rent_per_household = 15  # rent in hu per household

# Calculation
a = households * rent_per_household  # total rent in hu

# Output the result
a  # a is the total rent in hu
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will hold the total rent in hu.
