今有垣高九尺。瓜生其上，蔓日長七寸。瓠生其下，蔓日長一尺。問︰幾何日相逢？瓜、瓠各長幾何？
術曰：假令五日，不足五寸。令之六日，有餘一尺二寸。
荅曰： a日 。瓜長 b尺 ，瓠長 c尺 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. Here's the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
wall_height = 9  # in 尺
melon_growth_per_day = Fraction(7, 10)  # 7 寸 = 7/10 尺 per day
gourd_growth_per_day = 1  # 1 尺 per day

# Step 1: Determine the number of days (a) until they meet
# Let a be the number of days until the melon and gourd meet.
# The total length of the melon vine is a * melon_growth_per_day.
# The total length of the gourd vine is a * gourd_growth_per_day.
# They meet when the sum of their lengths equals the wall height:
# a * melon_growth_per_day + a * gourd_growth_per_day = wall_height

a = wall_height / (melon_growth_per_day + gourd_growth_per_day)

# Step 2: Calculate the lengths of the melon and gourd vines
b = a * melon_growth_per_day  # Length of the melon vine in 尺
c = a * gourd_growth_per_day  # Length of the gourd vine in 尺

# Results
a, b, c
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation of the Solution:
1. The wall height is 9 尺.
2. The melon vine grows at a rate of 7 寸 per day, which is converted to 尺 as \( \frac{7}{10} \) 尺 per day.
3. The gourd vine grows at a rate of 1 尺 per day.
4. The vines meet when the combined length of the melon and gourd vines equals the wall height.
5. Using the formula \( a \times \text{melon_growth_per_day} + a \times \text{gourd_growth_per_day} = \text{wall_height} \), we solve for \( a \), the number of days.
6. The lengths of the melon and gourd vines are then calculated using their respective growth rates.

### Final Values:
- \( a \): Number of days until they meet.
- \( b \): Length of the melon vine in 尺.
- \( c \): Length of the gourd vine in 尺.
