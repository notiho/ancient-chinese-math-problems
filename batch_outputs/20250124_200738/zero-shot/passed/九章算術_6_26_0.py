今有人持米出三關，外關三而取一，中關五而取一，內關七而取一，餘米五斗。問︰本持米幾何？
術曰：置米五斗。以所稅者三之，五之，七之，為實。以餘不稅者二、四、六相乘為法。實如法得一斗。
荅曰： a斗 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves calculating the original amount of rice (in "斗") that someone carried, given the tax rates at three gates and the remaining amount of rice.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Remaining rice after taxes
remaining_rice = 5  # in 斗

# Tax rates at the gates
tax_rate_outer = 3  # Outer gate takes 1/3
tax_rate_middle = 5  # Middle gate takes 1/5
tax_rate_inner = 7  # Inner gate takes 1/7

# Calculate the "實" (numerator of the formula)
numerator = tax_rate_outer * tax_rate_middle * tax_rate_inner

# Calculate the "法" (denominator of the formula)
denominator = (tax_rate_outer - 1) * (tax_rate_middle - 1) * (tax_rate_inner - 1)

# Original amount of rice
a = Fraction(numerator, denominator) * remaining_rice

# Output the result
a  # in 斗
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. The tax rates at the gates are given as fractions: 1/3, 1/5, and 1/7.
2. The formula for the original amount of rice is derived from the ancient method:
   - Multiply the tax rates (3, 5, 7) to get the numerator.
   - Multiply the differences between the tax rates and 1 (2, 4, 6) to get the denominator.
   - Multiply the resulting fraction by the remaining rice (5 斗) to compute the original amount.
3. The result is stored in the variable `a`, which represents the original amount of rice in 斗.

### Solution:
The value of `a` will be computed as a `Fraction` object, representing the exact amount of rice in 斗.
