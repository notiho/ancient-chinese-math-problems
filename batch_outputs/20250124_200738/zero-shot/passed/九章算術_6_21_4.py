今有一人一日為牡瓦三十八枚，一人一日為牝瓦七十六枚。今令一人一日作瓦，牝、牡相半，問︰成瓦幾何？
術曰：并牝、牡為法，牝牡相乘為實，實如法得一枚。
荅曰： a枚 。

To solve this problem, we will compute the number of tiles (瓦) that one person can produce in a day when the production of male tiles (牡瓦) and female tiles (牝瓦) is balanced (i.e., equal amounts of each type). Here's the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
male_tiles_per_day = 38  # 牡瓦 per day
female_tiles_per_day = 76  # 牝瓦 per day

# Compute the total production when male and female tiles are balanced
total_tiles_per_day = male_tiles_per_day + female_tiles_per_day
balanced_tiles_per_day = Fraction(male_tiles_per_day * female_tiles_per_day, total_tiles_per_day)

# Solution
a = balanced_tiles_per_day
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The value of `a` will represent the number of tiles (瓦) produced per day when the production of male and female tiles is balanced.
