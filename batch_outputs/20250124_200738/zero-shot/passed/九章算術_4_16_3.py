"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the circumference of a circle given its area. The formula provided in the problem states that we multiply the area by 12, then take the square root, and the result is the circumference.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction
import math

# Given area
area = Fraction(1518) + Fraction(3, 4)  # 1518 steps and 3/4 of a step

# Multiply the area by 12
area_times_12 = area * 12

# Take the square root to find the circumference
a = math.sqrt(area_times_12)

# The result is stored in variable 'a' (in steps)
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the circumference in steps. Note that the `Fraction` class is used to handle the fractional part of the area.
