今有米一千五百七十七斛，斛别加八斗三升。問：計㡬何？
術曰：列米一千五百七十七斛，以加米一斛八斗三升乘之即得。
答曰： a斛 。
"""

"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice when each of the 1,577斛 (units of volume) is increased by 8斗3升. In ancient Chinese measurements, 1斛 = 10斗 and 1斗 = 10升. Therefore, 8斗3升 is equivalent to \( 8.3 \)斗 or \( 8.3 / 10 = 0.83 \)斛.

The formula for the total rice is:
\[
\text{Total rice} = \text{Number of 斛} \times (\text{1斛} + \text{Increase per 斛 in 斛 units})
\]

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_hu = 1577  # Total number of 斛
increase_per_hu = Fraction(8, 10) + Fraction(3, 100)  # 8斗3升 converted to 斛

# Calculation
a = total_hu * (1 + increase_per_hu)  # Total rice in 斛

# Result
a
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will store the total amount of rice in 斛.
