今有上禾二秉，中禾三秉，下禾四秉，實皆不滿斗。上取中，中取下，下取上各一秉而實滿斗。問︰上、中、下禾實一秉各幾何？
術曰：如方程，各置所取，以正負術入之。正負術曰：同名相除，異名相益，正無入負之，負無入正之。其異名相除，同名相益，正無入正之，負無入負之。
方程術曰，置上禾三秉，中禾二秉，下禾一秉，實三十九斗，於右方。中、左禾列如右方。以右行上禾遍乘中行而以直除。又乘其次，亦以直除。然以中行中禾不盡者遍乘左行而以直除。左方下禾不盡者，上為法，下為實。實即下禾之實。求中禾，以法乘中行下實，而除下禾之實。餘如中禾秉數而一，即中禾之實。求上禾亦以法乘右行下實，而除下禾、中禾之實。餘如上禾秉數而一，即上禾之實。實皆如法，各得一斗。
荅曰：上禾一秉實 a斗 ，中禾一秉實 b斗 ，下禾一秉實 c斗 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese mathematical problem into Python code. The problem involves finding the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), which represent the amount of grain in one bundle of upper, middle, and lower grain respectively. The relationships between the grains are given, and we will use the `Fraction` class to ensure precise calculations.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given relationships:
# Upper grain (a), Middle grain (b), Lower grain (c)
# Upper grain takes 1 bundle from Middle grain, Middle grain takes 1 bundle from Lower grain,
# Lower grain takes 1 bundle from Upper grain, and each becomes full (1斗).

# Equations derived from the problem:
# 2a + b = 1
# 3b + c = 1
# 4c + a = 1

# Solve the system of equations step by step:
# From the first equation: b = 1 - 2a
# Substitute b into the second equation: 3(1 - 2a) + c = 1
# Simplify: 3 - 6a + c = 1
# c = 6a - 2
# Substitute c into the third equation: 4(6a - 2) + a = 1
# Simplify: 24a - 8 + a = 1
# 25a = 9
# a = 9 / 25

a = Fraction(9, 25)

# Calculate b using b = 1 - 2a
b = 1 - 2 * a

# Calculate c using c = 6a - 2
c = 6 * a - 2

# Results:
a, b, c

"""


### Explanation of the Code:
1. The problem provides three equations based on the relationships between the grains:
   - \( 2a + b = 1 \)
   - \( 3b + c = 1 \)
   - \( 4c + a = 1 \)
2. We solve these equations step by step:
   - From the first equation, express \( b \) in terms of \( a \): \( b = 1 - 2a \).
   - Substitute \( b \) into the second equation to express \( c \) in terms of \( a \): \( c = 6a - 2 \).
   - Substitute \( c \) into the third equation to solve for \( a \): \( a = \frac{9}{25} \).
3. Once \( a \) is found, calculate \( b \) and \( c \) using the derived formulas.

### Output:
The values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are:
- \( a = \frac{9}{25} \) (斗)
- \( b = \frac{7}{25} \) (斗)
- \( c = \frac{4}{25} \) (斗)
