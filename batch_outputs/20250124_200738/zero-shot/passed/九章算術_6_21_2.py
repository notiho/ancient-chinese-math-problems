今有一人一日為牡瓦三十八枚，一人一日為牝瓦七十六枚。今令一人一日作瓦，牝、牡相半，問︰成瓦幾何？
術曰：并牝、牡為法，牝牡相乘為實，實如法得一枚。
荅曰： a枚 。

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many tiles (瓦) one person can make in a day if they produce an equal number of male tiles (牡瓦) and female tiles (牝瓦). Here's the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
male_tiles_per_day = 38  # 牡瓦 per day
female_tiles_per_day = 76  # 牝瓦 per day

# Total tiles produced in one day
total_tiles_per_day = male_tiles_per_day + female_tiles_per_day

# The product of male and female tiles per day
product_of_tiles = male_tiles_per_day * female_tiles_per_day

# The number of tiles produced when male and female tiles are equal
a = Fraction(product_of_tiles, total_tiles_per_day)

# The result
a  # Answer in tiles
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the number of tiles (瓦) produced per day when male and female tiles are equal.
