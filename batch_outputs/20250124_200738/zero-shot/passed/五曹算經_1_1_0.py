今有方田廣從各六十八步。問：為田㡬何？
術曰：列田六十八步自相乘得四千六百二十四步以畝法除之即得。
答曰： a畝 奇 b步 。

"""
To solve this problem, we will compute the area of a square field where each side is 68 steps long. The total area is calculated by squaring the side length. Then, we convert the area into "畝" (mu) and "步" (bu). 

1 畝 = 240 步.

Here is the Python code to compute the solution:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given side length of the square field
side_length = 68  # in steps

# Compute the total area in steps
total_area = side_length * side_length  # in steps^2

# Convert the total area into 畝 and 步
a = total_area // 240  # whole 畝
b = total_area % 240   # remaining 步

# Results
a, b  # a is in 畝, b is in 步
#----- content ends here -----


"""


After running this code:
- `a` will hold the number of 畝.
- `b` will hold the remaining 步.
