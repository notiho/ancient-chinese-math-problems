今有粟七斗，三人分舂之，一人為糲米，一人為粺米，一人為鑿米，令米數等。問︰取粟為米各幾何？
術曰：列置糲米三十，粺米二十七，鑿米二十四，而反衰之，副并為法。以七斗乘未并者，各自為取粟實。實如法得一斗。若求米等者，以本率各乘定所取粟為實，以粟率五十為法，實如法得一斗。
荅曰：糲米取粟 a斗 。粺米取粟 b斗 。鑿米取粟 c斗 。為米各 d斗 。

To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code. The problem involves dividing 7斗 of grain among three people, each producing different types of rice (糲米, 粺米, 鑿米) such that the resulting rice quantities are equal. We will compute the values of the unknowns `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` using the given method.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given data
total_grain = 7  # Total grain in 斗
grain_rates = [30, 27, 24]  # Rates for 糲米, 粺米, 鑿米
rice_rate = 50  # Rate for converting grain to rice

# Step 1: Compute the amount of grain each person takes (a, b, c)
# Using the method described: reverse the rates and sum them as the denominator
denominator = sum(Fraction(rice_rate, rate) for rate in grain_rates)
a = Fraction(total_grain) * Fraction(rice_rate, grain_rates[0]) / denominator
b = Fraction(total_grain) * Fraction(rice_rate, grain_rates[1]) / denominator
c = Fraction(total_grain) * Fraction(rice_rate, grain_rates[2]) / denominator

# Step 2: Compute the amount of rice each person produces (d)
# Since the rice quantities are equal, we can calculate d using any grain amount
d = a * grain_rates[0] / rice_rate  # This will be the same for b and c

# Results
a, b, c, d
#----- content ends here -----


"""


### Explanation:
1. **Step 1**: Calculate the amount of grain each person takes (`a`, `b`, `c`) using the reverse rates and the total grain. The denominator is the sum of the reversed rates scaled by the rice rate.
2. **Step 2**: Calculate the amount of rice (`d`) each person produces. Since the rice quantities are equal, we can calculate `d` using any of the grain amounts and their respective rates.

### Output:
The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will hold the respective values for the grain and rice amounts.
