"""
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of intersections on a Go board with 19 rows and 19 columns. The problem states that we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Number of rows and columns on the Go board
rows = 19
columns = 19

# Calculate the total number of intersections
a = rows * columns
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The value of `a` will be `361`, representing the total number of intersections on the board.
