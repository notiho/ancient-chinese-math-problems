今有絹，七萬八千七百三十二匹，令一百六十二人分之。問：人得幾何？
術曰：置絹七萬八千七百三十二匹為實，以一百六十二人為法。實如法，即得。
答曰： a匹 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of silk pieces (78,732) by the number of people (162). Here's the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_silk = 78732  # Total silk pieces
total_people = 162  # Total number of people

# Calculation
a = Fraction(total_silk, total_people)  # Silk pieces per person

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the number of silk pieces each person gets, represented as a fraction.
