今有絹，七萬八千七百三十二匹，令一百六十二人分之。問：人得幾何？
術曰：置絹七萬八千七百三十二匹為實，以一百六十二人為法。實如法，即得。
答曰： a匹 。

"""
To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of silk pieces (78,732) by the number of people (162). The result will be the number of silk pieces each person gets.

Here is the Python code:


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_silk = 78732  # Total silk pieces
people = 162  # Number of people

# Calculation
a = Fraction(total_silk, people)  # Silk pieces per person

# The answer is stored in variable 'a'
#----- content ends here -----


"""


The variable `a` will contain the number of silk pieces each person gets, represented as a fraction.
