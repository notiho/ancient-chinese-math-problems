今有席，一領坐客二十三人，有客五十三萬三千六百八十人。問：席㡬何？
術曰：列五十三萬三千六百八十人，以二十三人除之即得。
答曰： a領 奇 b人 。

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many "席" (seats) are required to accommodate 533,680 people, given that each seat can hold 23 people. The solution will involve dividing the total number of people by the number of people per seat.

Here is the Python code to compute the values of "a" (the number of full seats) and "b" (the remaining people):


"""

#----- content starts here -----

from fractions import Fraction

# Given values
total_people = 533680  # Total number of people
people_per_seat = 23   # Number of people per seat

# Compute the number of full seats (a) and the remaining people (b)
a = total_people // people_per_seat  # Full seats
b = total_people % people_per_seat   # Remaining people

# Results
a, b
#----- content ends here -----


"""


After running this code:
- `a` will represent the number of full seats.
- `b` will represent the remaining people who cannot be seated in a full seat.
