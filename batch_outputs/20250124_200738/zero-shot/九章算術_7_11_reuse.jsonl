The excess is 3.75 feet, and the deficiency is 0.5 feet. The rate difference is 1 day.\n3. Using the formula from the method, we calculate `a` as the number of days.\n4. The distances dug by the large mouse (`b`) and the small mouse (`c`) are proportional to their respective rates.\n\n### Final Values:\n- `a`: Number of days until they meet.\n- `b`: Distance dug by the large mouse.\n- `c`: Distance dug by the small mouse.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 1, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we will translate the ancient Chinese math problem into Python code.
