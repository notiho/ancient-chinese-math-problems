Converting to \u5c3a, this becomes \\( \\frac{5}{10} \\) \u5c3a x \\( \\frac{5}{10} \\) \u5c3a x \\( \\frac{5}{10} \\) \u5c3a, or \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) \u5c3a x \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) \u5c3a x \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) \u5c3a.\n3. The volume of one pillow is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8} \\) cubic \u5c3a.\n4. The number of pillows that can be made is the total volume of the block divided by the volume of one pillow: \\( 27 \\div \\frac{1}{8} = 27 \\times 8 = 216 \\).\n5.
